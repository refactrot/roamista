Spend 3 Days in Paris \u2014 Luxury Hotels, Natural Wine Spots, and Under-the-radar Museums Included\nFrom picturesque walks to souvenir shopping, a longtime Francophile shares her ideal three-day Paris itinerary.\nBy\nSophie Dodd\nSophie Dodd\nSophie Dodd is a travel, wine and lifestyle writer.\nTravel + Leisure Editorial Guidelines\nUpdated on June 18, 2024\nIn This Article\nView All\nIn This Article\nDay 1\nDay 2\nDay 3\nParis in One Day\nParis in One Week\nClose\nPhoto:\nSophie Dodd/Travel + Leisure\nOn a recent layover in Paris, I spent 15 minutes weeping outside a boulangerie, hands clutching my croissant like a stress ball as I spiraled into decision-paralysis mode.\nHow do I make the most of 24 hours here?\nI asked myself, my mind racing over how to fit a week\u2019s worth of explorations into one day. The answer ended up being: Stop stressing. Walk around. Eat the crushed croissant, and drink a glass of wine with lunch.\nParis\nprovides endless temptations: art and architecture, Michelin-star restaurants, unrivaled vintage shopping, fantastic hotels, and four-euro wine. There\u2019s no way to do it all, so allowing yourself some grace to wander aimlessly \u2014 the French call it\nfl\u00e2nerie\n\u2014\u00a0is key to making the most of your trip. To that end, I suggest basing yourself around the incredibly walkable Marais, which marries classic Parisian architecture with hip restaurants and shops. I\u2019d spring for the new cool-kid hideaway,\nLe Grand Mazarin\n, a maximalist hotel that boasts an indoor pool and hammam to revive you after a long day.\nHere, I\u2019ve curated a jam-packed three-day itinerary for a quick\ntrip to Paris\n, in a bid to prevent myself and everyone else from ever ruining a perfectly good croissant out of choice-anxiety again. Pick what works for you, skip what doesn\u2019t (but not\nMus\u00e9e Bourdelle\n). Keep in mind that many of the city\u2019s attractions and restaurants close on Sunday and/or Monday, so be sure to check their hours in advance. Whatever you do, I hope you people-watch at a cafe somewhere, lingering long enough to convince yourself you might be picking up French by osmosis. I hope you notice how the limestone avenues absorb the light, and maybe a little piece of you, too.\nSophie Dodd/Travel + Leisure\nDay 1\nAfter an overnight flight, I always start my day with my favorite French comfort food: a\ngalette compl\u00e8te\nfrom\nBreizh Caf\u00e9\n, which has several outposts around the city that whip up some of the best buckwheat crepes in Paris. Tucking into their famous\ncompl\u00e8te oignons\n\u2014 layers of ham and Comt\u00e9 cheese topped with a sunny-side up egg and onions decadently caramelized in cider from Brittany \u2014 is the warmest welcome you\u2019ll find in the French capital.\nWalk off your breakfast with a stroll through the\nMarais\n, making your way toward beloved concept store\nMerci\nto satisfy all your souvenir needs, from stationery to expertly curated home goods, clothing, and beyond. If jet lag is setting in, grab a coffee at their\nUsed Book Caf\u00e9\n, or down the road at the oft-Instagrammed\nBoot Caf\u00e9\n.\nMosey over to Place des Vosges, the oldest square in the city. In the warmer months, it\u2019s a lively picnic destination for locals and tourists alike. The manicured trees, stone fountains, and red brick archways surrounding the leafy square are stunning from any angle, but if you\u2019re looking to experience the square\u2019s royal history from a whole new perspective, consider splurging on a room at\nCour des Vosges\n. The refined five-star hotel offers luxuriously intimate accommodations without fuss or ostentation \u2014 plus, exclusive views onto the square from the comfort of your bed.\nHidden just beyond the square are the courtyard and gardens of the H\u00f4tel de Sully, a quieter green space offering a wonderful respite from the bustling Rue Saint-Antoine. From there, walk down to the Seine and cross over to \u00cele Saint-Louis, a jewel-sized island where you can admire the elegant 17th-century architecture and stop by\nL\u2019\u00c9tiquette\n, a beloved natural wine spot that offers takeaway bottles and wine tastings with the owner, Herv\u00e9.\nWhile the Notre-Dame cathedral is still under renovation (it\u2019s set to\nreopen in December 2024\n),\u00a0you can still admire its striking Gothic facade before walking to nearby\nShakespeare and Company\n, the city\u2019s famous English-language bookstore.\nPost up at the counter of\nL\u2019Avant Comptoir de la Terre\nfor a light lunch of Basque-style tapas (don\u2019t skip the seared foie gras) and,\noui\n, more wine. Afterward, wander around the chic side streets of\nSaint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s\n, home to Paris institutions like Les Deux Magots and Caf\u00e9 de Flore, plus a bevy of art galleries and upscale shops that are better to visit here than on the over-crowded Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es; some favorites for window shopping include\nLe Bon March\u00e9\n(the Left Bank\u2019s grand dame department store), the fabulously decorated Herm\u00e8s store, and\nOfficine Universelle Buly\n, which crafts spectacular candles that make for ultra-chic souvenirs. If you\u2019re up for it, pause to people-watch at the always-bustling\nBar du March\u00e9\nbefore heading back to your hotel to rest up before dinner.\nTo finish the day, book a table in the bustling 11th arrondissement at\nLe Bistrot Paul Bert\n, which serves elevated comfort food \u2014 think steak frites, seafood, and epic desserts \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s earned a devout fan base.\nSophie Dodd/Travel + Leisure\nDay 2\nToday\u2019s the day to pack in your museum visits and sightseeing. Wake up early and grab breakfast at your hotel, or treat yourself to a top-notch coffee and croissant at a cafe.\nWalk over to the Louvre, where you should arrive 30 minutes before opening if you\u2019re hoping to snap a selfie with the Mona Lisa. Frankly, if you only have three days, I\u2019d skip it in favor of visiting some of the city\u2019s other world-class museums \u2014 but be sure to at least stroll around the iconic I. M. Pei-designed glass pyramid and the historic courtyard. While you could head straight to the Tuileries Garden from here, I love to detour to the Palais-Royal Garden first, an oasis that\u2019s home to a picture-perfect fountain rimmed by those iconic green S\u00e9nat chairs.\nPass through the palace\u2019s inner courtyard on your way there, where you can scramble around Daniel Buren\u2019s famous black-and-white Colonnes de Buren installation. Just beyond the garden is Galerie Vivienne, a breathtaking 19th-century covered passage with mosaic floors, antique glass ceilings, and a delightful bookshop. When I think about some of the places that first sparked my love of Paris more than a decade ago, these are what come to mind.\nMake your way back to the Tuileries Garden and on to your next museum. Impressionist lovers who are short on time should prioritize the\nMus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie\nto bask in the beauty of Monet\u2019s \"Water Lilies,\" or plan to linger a little longer across the river at the expansive\nMus\u00e9e d'Orsay\n, which is housed in a former Beaux-Arts train station.\nSculpture fans should check out the nearby\nMus\u00e9e Rodin\n, or consider the worthwhile trek into Montparnasse to be blown away by the works and former studio of sculptor Antoine Bourdelle at the lesser-known\nMus\u00e9e Bourdelle\n. Whichever museums you choose to visit, be sure to book your ticket in advance to avoid massive lines.\nFor lunch, book the three-course tasting menu at\nSubstance\n, a sleek and modern Michelin-starred restaurant in the 16th arrondissement that boasts one of the finest Champagne lists in all of Paris. It\u2019s right around the corner from Place du Trocad\u00e9ro, an elevated (but typically tourist-swarmed) plaza that offers sweeping views of the\nEiffel Tower\n.\nFrom there, hop on the metro line 6 (or in a taxi, if you prefer) to the Arc de Triomphe. The panoramic view from the top is both fantastic and incredibly crowded; I\u2019d rather enjoy the cityscape later on with a drink in hand at\nBonnie\n, SO/Paris hotel\u2019s trendy terrace restaurant that\u2019s back over in the fourth arrondissement. But first, take your time wandering the iconic Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, making your way toward the storied Place de la Concorde \u2014 the famous site of Marie Antoinette\u2019s beheading by guillotine. Chances are, you might need a drink after that; duck into\nH\u00f4tel de Crillon,\nA Rosewood Hotel, to check out the opulent\nBar Les Ambassadeurs\n. (Pro tip: Be sure to snap a selfie in the marble bathroom.)\nStick around the area for dinner. Try to nab a table at the ultra-trendy\nHotel Costes\n\u2014 reservations are hard to come by, but the red-lit atmosphere is glamorous, and the legendary DJ sets continue late into the night.\nSophie Dodd/Travel + Leisure\nDay 3\nFor a new perspective on the city, take yourself up the steep steps of\nMontmartre\n, Paris\u2019 longtime artist haven. You\u2019ll beat the crowds if you arrive early in the morning, and the best place to start is Place Dalida, where you\u2019ll be rewarded with a bucolic view of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Basilica. Climbing the cobbled slope of Rue de l\u2019Abreuvoir is a chance to travel back in time, bearing witness to a nostalgic snapshot of what this neighborhood used to feel like. Whatever the season, this street is utterly charming \u2014 bursting with wisteria in summer and framed by red and golden leaves in autumn. Pass by the pink facade of\nLa Maison Rose\nto snap some classic shots on your way up to Le Clos Montmartre, Paris\u2019 only vineyard. (It\u2019s privately owned, but guided tours are organized a few times per year.)\nThis part of the city feels like walking through a film set \u2014 it\u2019s all steep stone steps framed by vintage street lamps, with a sprinkling of bistros thrown in. To that end, peek around Place du Tertre, a definitively touristy but still-charming square (if you get there ahead of the crowds, that is), which is filled with artists who will ask to paint your portrait. (Note: This area is known for pickpocketing, so keep your belongings secure.) Next, ogle the majesty of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, which offers one of the most spectacular views of Paris spread out below.\nIf it\u2019s still early enough, head over to the\nMus\u00e9e de la Vie Romantique\n(Museum of Romantic Life) for a coffee and pastry at the Rose Bakery tearoom, tucked into their unsurprisingly romantic courtyard and greenhouse. But don\u2019t spoil your appetite \u2014 you won\u2019t want to miss the inventive small plates and next-level wine list at\nMokonuts\n, an intimate lunch spot run by a Japanese-Lebanese couple serving up what has consistently ranked among my favorite meals in Paris. The food is fantastic, the 11th arrondissement space is unfussy, and the reservations are hard to come by (call and hope for a cancellation \u2014\u00a0it happens more often than you\u2019d think). Order the entire menu (it\u2019s small), including at least two desserts. Trust me.\nIf it\u2019s warm out, go lounge along Canal Saint-Martin or the banks of the Seine, where locals picnic, read, smoke, and smooch \u2014 take your pick. On colder days, round off your museum visits with a trip to the\nCentre Pompidou\nfor modern art or\nMus\u00e9e Carnavalet\n(housed in two fabulous mansions) to delve into the history of Paris.\nFor dinner, few restaurants charm so instantly as\nLe Clown Bar\n\u2014 famous for their veal brains and sweetbreads, I choose to go for the delightfully kitschy Belle \u00c9poque clown decor. On a recent trip, I skipped the brains and went for the Japanese-inspired beef tartare \u2014\u00a0few days have passed that I haven\u2019t thought about it. There\u2019s an abundance of natural wine that will appeal to a range of palates, including those who think natural wine is \u201ctoo funky.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re looking for a nightcap (it\u2019s your last night in Paris!),\nLittle Red Door\nserves up exceptional and inventive cocktails around the corner.\nTaylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure\nParis in One Day\nIf you\u2019ve only got one day in Paris \u2014 perhaps you\u2019re on a long layover \u2014 you\u2019ll need to remind yourself from the beginning: You can\u2019t do it all. I\u2019ve nearly ruined several brief trips by thinking about all the things I should have packed in, rather than feeling present in the few that I was able to manage.\nIf it\u2019s your first time, I\u2019d combine the itineraries for days one and two. Base yourself a bit more central to the main attractions \u2014 for a night of absolute pampering, treat yourself to a stay at H\u00f4tel de Crillon, A Rosewood Hotel, or Le Meurice \u2014 two luxury properties just off the Tuileries Garden. Wake up early and indulge in room service or grab a fresh croissant from a boulangerie near your hotel, and savor every second of that interaction \u2014 the greasy bag, the warm dough, the flaky mess of it all. Start at the Palais-Royal Garden and Galerie Vivienne before ducking over to see Notre-Dame.\nUnless you\u2019re a serious art history buff, I\u2019d avoid spending your one day inside a museum, but you should still wander around the Louvre courtyard and Tuileries Garden \u2014\nLe Cafe Marly\nis a pricey lunch, but offers classic French dishes served with iconic views of the pyramid.\nGrab the metro over to Place du Trocadero for some Eiffel Tower time, wander the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, then stop back at the hotel to freshen up before taking yourself a bit further afield for dinner \u2014 go for\nBistrot des Tournelles\n, another excellent spot for homemade pork terrine, steak frites, chocolate mousse, and other French comforts.\nPage Light Studios/Getty Images\nParis in One Week\nLa chance!\n(What luck!) You can take your days a bit easier than the itinerary suggested here, lingering a little longer at cafes perhaps and spreading out more museum visits (you really shouldn\u2019t miss Mus\u00e9e Bourdelle in this case). While you could easily\nspend the whole week\nin Paris, you might want to plan an overnight to Versailles, where you should book a royally exceptional stay at the opulent\nAirelles Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, Le Grand Contr\u00f4le\n, the only hotel on the palace grounds.\nIf you\u2019re visiting\nParis in winter\n, you\u2019ll want to make time for the\nfestive holiday markets\n, while in summer, the Seine beckons with its faux beach. Whatever the season, the best thing you can do with your extra time is allow yourself to wander aimlessly, letting the city reveal its magic to you.\nRelated Articles\nAn Insider's Guide to Paris \u2014 Luxury Hotels, Vintage Shops, and the City's Best Restaurants Included\nHow to Spend One Perfect Day in Paris\nHow to Spend the Perfect Christmas in Paris\nThis Luxury Tour Guide Shares Her Tips for the Best Restaurants, Shopping, and More in Paris \u2014 and We're Booking a Flight\n10 Common Travel Mistakes to Avoid in Paris, According to a Local\nNovember Is the Best Time to Travel to Paris.

Welcome to one of our favorite cities. With\n3 days in Paris\n, you have enough time to take in the view from the Eiffel Tower, say hi to Mona Lisa in the Louvre, eat street food crepes, climb the Arc de Triomphe, explore several Parisian neighborhoods, and visit the amazing Palace of Versailles. We put together this 3-day Paris itinerary to help you have the best experience.\nAbout this Itinerary\nParis is one of Europe\u2019s most popular destinations and with that, lines can be long to visit the more popular sites. The last thing you want to do on vacation is to wait in line after line after line. What fun would that be?\nWe put a lot of research into how to skip the lines at these attractions. You will have to book some tickets in advance but it will save you hours once you are in Paris. All of the links to book your tickets are included in this post.\nTo avoid museum fatigue, I didn\u2019t put too many museums in one day. Yes, the art museums in Paris are amazing, but most people can\u2019t handle more than two museums per day. I know I can\u2019t!\nFinally, all of the times in the daily schedule are rough estimates, just to give you an idea about timing throughout the day. Your times may differ, based on queues and how much time you decide to spend at each place. I did my best to anticipate waiting times and visiting times, but on very busy days (or very quiet days) these times can differ.\nI do my best to keep the hours of operation and pricing up to date for each attraction, however, these can change at any time. I recommend getting updated hours and pricing for your dates of travel.

You can avoid this nightmare by booking your tickets in advance or taking a skip-the-line tour. The cheapest way to visit the Eiffel Tower is to purchase your tickets\nonline in advance on the official website\n, but these tend to sell out almost as soon as they become available (60 days in advance). If they are sold out, we recommend\nthis skip the line tour,\nwhich costs just slightly more than the ticket cost. We took this same tour and had a great experience.\nThere are two ways up the Eiffel Tower.\nYou can take an elevator or you can walk up the stairs. The queues for the elevators are very long and the queue for the stairs is much shorter. The choice is yours. If you take the stairs, you get to eat more chocolate and crepes later!\nIf you plan to take the elevator, I highly recommend that you\nbook your tickets in advance.\nPRO TRAVEL TIP:\nOnline tickets go on sale 60 days in advance for the elevator, 14 days in advance for the stairs.\nView from the third floor\nView from the second floor of the Eiffel Tower\nHow to Visit the Eiffel Tower\nMore Information:\nCheck out our guide\nHow to Visit the Eiffel Tower,\nwhich has a lot more valuable information about how to visit the Eiffel Tower, including dining options and how to avoid a long wait in line.\nGetting here by Metro:\nLine 9, stop Trocadero; Line 6, Bir-Hakeim; Line 8, stop Ecole-Militaire. For the prettiest walk to the Eiffel Tower, get off at the Trocadero metro station and enjoy the view as you approach the tower (allow 15 minutes for this walk).\nHours:\nFor updated hours and pricing, visit the\nofficial website.\nCost:\nElevator to 2nd floor \u20ac23.10; Elevator to the top \u20ac36.10; Stairs to 2nd level \u20ac14.50; Stairs to 2nd level and elevator to the top \u20ac27.50\nTickets:\nBook your ticket in advance on the\nofficial website\n.\nIf tickets are sold out for your dates of travel, you can book a tour for skip the line access to the Eiffel Tower.\nHere are several highly rated tours that allow you to skip the line at the Eiffel Tower.\n11 am: Picnic in Champ de Mars\nFor the ultimate picnic experience, go shopping on a charming French street and enjoy your meal in Champ de Mars, the large park in front of the Eiffel Tower.\nOn our first visit to Paris, Tim and I did this and it was one of many favorite memories from Paris. There\u2019s something about sitting in the park, eating cheese and chocolate, and enjoying the view of the Eiffel Tower. It was such a great experience that we did it again several years later with Tyler, Kara, and our mothers.\nFrom the Eiffel Tower, it\u2019s another very pretty walk to\nRue Cler\n. On this short shopping street, go shopping in the patisseries (pastry shops), boulangeries (bread shops), fromageries (cheese shops), and shops selling fruit and chocolate.\nPlaces to visit on Rue Cler:\nLe Chocolat Alain Ducasse for gourmet chocolate\nLa Fromagerie for cheese\nThere are other small markets where you can purchase fruit, bread, crackers, meat and cheese\nLes Grandes Caves for a bottle of wine\nTake your food and find a nice spot on Champ de Mars and enjoy the view.\nChamp de Mars\n1 pm: The Louvre\nThe Louvre is the world\u2019s largest art museum. This building was once the home to French Kings, including Louis XIV. During the French Revolution in the 18th century, the Louvre was converted to a museum.\nThis place is massive and you literally could spend days here. My favorite part about visiting the Louvre is just taking in the grandeur of the building. The sheer size of this place is impressive. Several rooms, like the Apollo Gallery (where the crown jewels are kept), are gorgeous.\nThe Louvre\nApollo Gallery\nIf you are an art lover, take several hours and enjoy this spectacular place. However, if you just want to visit the highlights, you can do so in about an hour.\nThe main sites to visit in the Louvre are the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory.\nHow to Visit the Louvre\nThere are several ways to avoid waiting in a long line to get into the Louvre.\nPurchase the Museum Pass.\nThis allows you to skip the ticket line but you may still have to wait in a much shorter security line. With the Museum Pass, you must book a time slot in order to guarantee access into the museum. You must provide the serial number of your Museum Pass, so you cannot do this until you are in possession of the Museum Pass. Learn more\nhere.\nBook your tickets online in advance.\nOn the official\nLouvre website\n, you can purchase your tickets in advance. These cost \u20ac22 and the website advertises less than a 30 minute wait if you purchase your tickets in advance.

We also have a walking tour that quickly and efficiently gets you to the highlights and then goes deeper into the Louvre, if you have more time. Check it out \u2193\nThe Louvre\nBest Way to Visit the Louvre: Walking Tour to the Top Sights Plus Printable eBook\nEverything you need to know to see the best of the Louvre and have a great experience.\n3:30 pm: Indulge at Angelina\u2019s\nHopefully you worked up a bit of an appetite because now it\u2019s time for a little indulgence. From the Louvre, walk through the Tuileries Garden and cross Rue de Rivoli to Angelina. Angelina serves decadent hot chocolate and delicious French pastries. Enjoy!\nHot Chocolate at Angelina\u2019s\n4:30 pm: Place de la Concorde\nFrom Angelina, stroll through Tuileries Garden or along the Rue de Rivoli to Place de la Concorde. This famous square is full of French history. This was the spot during the French Revolution where King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and Robespierre were executed by guillotine.\nFrom mid-November to early May a giant Ferris wheel sits in Place de la Concorde. If the line is short and you want a nice view of Paris, consider taking a ride.\n5 pm: Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\nThe Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es is one of the most recognizable streets in the world. It is famous as being the finish of the Tour de France and the location of the Bastille Day military parade. Restaurants, shops, the theaters line the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. It has a touristy feel but it\u2019s still worth the stroll.\nChamps-\u00c9lys\u00e9es | 3 Days in Paris Itinerary\nAlong the way, if you want another French treat, consider stopping into\nLaduree\nfor macarons.\nFrom Place de la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe, it is a 2.3 km (1.4 mile) walk.\nYou can walk the entire length of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es or shorten the walk by taking line 1 on the metro from Concorde to Franklin D. Roosevelt or George V.\n6:30 pm: Arc de Triomphe\nIt\u2019s time to take in the view from the mighty Arc de Triomphe. This is my favorite view of Paris. There\u2019s just something about looking down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es to the Louvre, out to La Defense, and of course, having the wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower.\nWhile on top of the Arc, look straight down. You are standing at one of the world\u2019s largest round-abouts, where twelve avenues come together. Watching the cars navigate this circle is very entertaining.\nView from the Arc de Triomphe\nChamps-\u00c9lys\u00e9es from the Arc de Triomphe\nFun Fact:\nDid you know that the Arc de Triomphe was almost a statue of a giant elephant? 45 years before the Arc was built, French architect Ribart proposed to build a 3-level elephant at the same site. The French government shot down this proposal. Could you imagine a giant elephant in the center of Paris?\nHours:\nApril 1 to September 30: 10 am to 11 pm; October 1 to March 31: 10 am to 10:30 pm; get updated hours\nhere.\nCost:\nAdults \u20ac16; 17 and under are free; included on the Museum Pass.\nClick here\nto purchase a skip the line ticket.\nClosest metro station:\nCharles de Gaulle Etoile lines 1, 2 and 6\nPowered by\nGetYourGuide\nDinner, Drinks & a Seine River Cruise\nEnd the day with dinner and drinks.\nFor dinner, your options are endless. Paris is filled with rooftop bars and restaurants with a view of the city, quaint sidewalk cafes, and fine dining restaurants.\nFor recommendations on where to eat and drink, check out our guides to the\nRooftop Restaurants and Bars in Paris\nand\n10 Foods to Eat in Paris\n(and where to get them).\nSome of our favorite places to eat are\nLes Ombres\n(an upscale French restaurant with an incredible view of the Eiffel Tower),\nLangosteria\n(an upscale Italian restaurant with a view of Pont Neuf and the Seine River), and if you want the experience of dining on the Eiffel Tower,\nMadame Brasserie\nor\nLe Jules Verne.\nL\u2019Oiseau Blanc\nFor an amazing culinary experience with a view of Paris, take a look at\nL\u2019Oiseau Blanc\n, a 2-star Michelin restaurant with a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower.\nIf you are looking for a very cool dinner/drink spot, go to the\nBuddha Bar\n. We loved it here. The lower level is a restaurant and along the second level are lounge areas with views over the restaurant. It feels like you have left Paris and entered Asia.\nBuddha Bar\nYou also have the option to take a\nSeine River cruise.\nThere are sunset cruises, dinner cruises, and nighttime cruises along the Seine River. These typically last 1 to 2 hours and some cruises include drinks and/or a meal.\nThis evening dinner cruise\ngets rave reviews and starts at 8:30 pm, so you have plenty of time to visit the Arc de Triomphe and get to the meeting point for the cruise.\nDay 2\nThe Historic Center of Paris, Musee d\u2019Orsay & Montmartre\n8:00 am: \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9\nOur day starts with a visit to Sainte-Chapelle. You can take the metro to Cit\u00e9, the closest station, but I recommend a more scenic route with just a little more walking.\n\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 is the small island in the center of Paris that is home to Sainte-Chapelle and Notre Dame. It is the historic heart of Paris. Approaching it from the Right Bank and crossing\nPont Neuf\nonto \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 (the oldest bridge in Paris) is a very scenic way to start the day.\nFor a scenic walk to \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, I recommend taking the metro to Louvre-Rivoli or Pont Neuf, walking towards the Seine, and then walking along the river to Pont Neuf. Pont Neuf is the stone bridge that crosses the Seine on the western edge of the island. From Pont Neuf, enjoy the view along the Seine, to the next bridge, Pont des Arts, and to the Eiffel Tower off in the distance.\n9 am: Sainte-Chapelle\nSainte-Chapelle is home to one of the world\u2019s best displays of stained glass. It is gorgeous inside, much prettier than the inside of Notre Dame Cathedral.\nSainte Chapelle\nThis is another location that is notorious for having long lines so, for the best experience, purchase your ticket in advance (on the\nofficial website\n, you will book a time slot for your visit).\nHours:\nApril 1 to September 30: 9 am to 7 pm; October 1 to March 31: 9 am to 5 pm; closed January 1, May 1, December 25\nCost:\n\u20ac13; included with the Museum Pass\nCombo Ticket with Conciergerie:\n\u20ac20\nMetro Station:\nLine 4, Cite\nWebsite:\nSainte-Chapelle can close on other days during the year. Check their\nwebsite\nto confirm hours before your visit.\nSkip-the-Line Tickets:\nOn GetYourGuide, you can get a\nskip-the-line-ticket combination ticket\nfor both Sainte-Chapelle and the Conciergerie.\nThe Conciergerie\nThis is optional, but for those with an interest in French history, you can visit the Conciergerie. This is where people were imprisoned before taken to Place de la Concorde to be executed. Marie Antoinette is the most famous prisoner.\nThe Conciergerie is located next to Sainte-Chapelle.\nHours:\nOpen every day 9:30 am to 6 pm\nCost:\n\u20ac13; Combination ticket with Sainte-Chapelle \u20ac20; included with the Museum Pass\n10:30 am: Notre Dame Cathedral\nFrom Sainte-Chapelle it\u2019s a very short walk to Notre Dame Cathedral.\nIn front of Notre Dame Cathedral a small plaque marks\nPoint Zero\n(Point Zero des Routes de France), the historic center of Paris.\nIn 2019, Notre Dame closed after a devastating fire destroyed parts of the cathedral. The cathedral underwent a massive restoration project, partially reopening in December 2024.\nVisitors can now enter Notre Dame Cathedral. To do this, you can either book a time slot in advance (this is free to do on the\nofficial website\n) or get in line at the entrance to the cathedral. Making a reservation in advance can save a lot of time, as there is generally a queue to enter Notre Dame Cathedral.\nThe towers are still closed indefinitely, although you can get updates about their reopening on the\nofficial website.\nOnce finished at Notre Dame, walk through \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. It is a quick walk to one of the prettiest storefronts in Paris,\nAu Vieux d\u2019Arcole.\nThis is a small cafe so you can eat an early lunch here.\nAu Vieux Paris\n11:30 am: \u00cele Saint-Louis\nFrom \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, cross Pont Saint-Louis to \u00cele Saint-Louis. This island gets fewer visitors than \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 and it is a good place to go shopping and have lunch. A good lunch spot is\nPom\u2019 Canelle\n, a restaurant that serves French and European food at reasonable prices (location: 27 Rue des 2 Ponts).\nFor an amazing ice cream shop, it is just a one minute walk to\nBertillon Glacier\n. This place is world famous for its ice cream and sorbet. In fact, you could skip lunch and just eat here instead (we did!).\nNote:\nThere are several ice cream shops with name Berthillon in the area. You want to visit the one in this photo with the address 29-31 Rue Saint-Louis en l\u2019Ile.\n1 pm: Walk along the Seine\nCross\nPont de la Tournelle\nto the Left Bank. Walk along the Seine. As you approach\nPont de l\u2019Archeveche\nyou get a beautiful view of Notre Dame. Pont de l\u2019Archeveche makes a great photo spot of Notre Dame.\nNote:\nCurrently, the back of Notre Dame is covered with elaborate scaffolding. It\u2019s still a sight to see, the amazing amount of work that is going into restoring this landmark.\nPont de L\u2019Archeveche\nAs you continue your walk along the river you will notice stands set up selling books. These booksellers, or\n\u201cbouquinistes\u201d\nsell used books, magazines, and posters.\nBouquinistes\nYou will also pass\nShakespeare & Company\n. This bookstore opened in 1919 and was a gathering place for Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, and Ezra Pound.\nContinue the stroll along the Seine until you reach Musee d\u2019Orsay.\n2 pm: Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay\nI will admit it, I am not an art museum lover. But I do love Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. This museum is simply fabulous. If you arrive here at 2 pm, you have 4 hours to tour the museum, more than enough time to really enjoy the main exhibits.\nMus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay houses the largest collection of Impressionist art in the world.\nIt is here that you can see Monet, Manet, Degas, Cezanne, Renoir, Van Gogh, Gaugin and more. It\u2019s literally a collection of the who\u2019s who in the Impressionist art world.\nBut this museum is more than just Impressionist art. The building is also a work of art. Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay was once Gare d\u2019Orsay, an old train station, that was renovated and became this art museum. It is beautiful inside.\nMus\u00e9e D\u2019Orsay | 3 Days in Paris Itinerary\nOn the top floor, look for the giant clock windows that give you a very unique view of Paris and make a creative photographic spot.\nHours:\nDaily 9:30 am to 6 pm; open until 9:45 on Thursday; closed Mondays, May 1, and December 25\nCost:\n\u20ac16, included with the Museum Pass. You can purchase an advanced ticket on the official website.\nWebsite:\nGet updated hours and pricing on the\nofficial website.\nOptional: Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie\nThis is a small museum that features Impressionist artwork. The highlights of this museum are the eight Water Lilies murals painted by Claude Monet. You can also see art by Picasso, Sisley, Cezanne, Matisse, and more.\nMus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie\nIf you are doing good on time and like the idea of visiting another Impressionist art museum, it\u2019s easy to add Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie onto today. This museum is much smaller than Musee d\u2019Orsay, so it doesn\u2019t take up much of your time. You could simply see the Water Lilies Murals or tour the entire museum.\nGetting Here:\nFrom Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, cross the Seine River to the Tuileries Garden. Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie is located on the southwest corner of Tuileries Garden, just a 10 minute walk from Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay.\nHours:\n9 am to 6 pm, Wednesday through Monday; closed on Tuesday.\nCost:\n\u20ac12.50, included with the Museum Pass\nWebsite:\nGet updated hours and pricing on the\nofficial website.\n6 pm: Sacre-Coeur and Montmartre\nSpend the rest of the afternoon and evening exploring Montmartre. This maze of hilly streets is one of Paris\u2019 prettiest neighborhoods to visit.\nI recommend getting off at the Lamarck metro station and walking towards the Sacre-Coeur Basilica. This is a very nice walk that takes you past photogenic spots such as\nLa Maison Rose\nand\nLe Consulat Restaurant.\nMontmartre\nMontmartre\nBefore arriving at the basilica you will walk through\nPlace du Tertre\n. This small square is filled with artists. Go shopping, grab a drink at a caf\u00e9, or have your portrait drawn.\nPlace du Tertre\nThe\nSacre-Coeur Basilica\nsits atop the highest hill in Paris. The steps in front of the Basilica are a popular spot to watch the sunset. You also have the option to climb the 300 steps to the top of the Dome for an even better view.\nSacre-Coeur\nHours:\n6:30 am to 10:30 pm\nFor more information, visit the official\nwebsite\n.\nIf you want to take a guided tour of Montmartre and the Sacre Coeur,\nthis one hour tour\ngets excellent reviews.\n7:00 pm: Dinner\nHere are a few dinner ideas for tonight.\nOn our most recent trip to Paris, we dined at\nMaggie Restaurant\n, which is located inside of Hotel Rochechouart, within walking distance of the Sacre Coeur basilica. We had a wonderful dinner, dining on roasted turbot and seared scallops and the largest artichoke I\u2019ve ever seen. On top of the hotel is a rooftop bar and terrace with a view of Sacre Coeur and the city skyline.\nLe Relais Gascon.\nWe had a wonderful dinner here. This restaurant serves French food and is located in Montmartre.\nLa Maison Rose.\nThe photogenic caf\u00e9 also makes a great spot for dinner. It is located in Montmartre.\nLe Moulin Rouge.\nEnd the day with a show at the Moulin Rouge. Dinner shows start at 7 pm and includes a 3-course dinner along with the show. The later shows (at 9 pm and 11 pm) do not include dinner. Tickets for the\nMoulin Rouge\nbook up months in advance and if tickets are sold out for your visit, you can also check\nGetYourGuide.\nAfter dinner,\nLe Chat Noir\nis a great spot for drinks, if you aren\u2019t quite ready to end the day. It\u2019s just a short walk from the Moulin Rouge.\nFrom the Sacre-Coeur, you can walk to the Moulin Rouge or ride the metro to Pigalle.\nFrance Travel Guide\nSee all of our articles\nDay 3\nVersailles & More Time in Paris\nThe Palace of Versailles\nVersailles is a royal chateau located on the outskirts of Paris. In 1682, King Louis XIV moved the Royal Court from the Louvre to the Palace of Versailles. For a little more than 100 years, this was the seat of government for France. That ended in 1789 with the French Revolution. The Treaty of Versailles was signed in the Hall of Mirrors, ending World War I.\nDuring your visit to Versailles you have the option to tour the palace and get to stroll through the gorgeous gardens.\nThe Latona Basin\nThe Hall of Mirrors | Read our guide\nHow to Visit Versailles\nto learn how to take this photo without the crowds\nThe Orangery\nHow long does a visit last?\nIf you\u2019re fast, it takes 3 to 4 hours to zip through the palace and walk through a portion of the gardens. Some people spend all day here, touring the entire gardens as well as the Estate of Trianon.\nOn this itinerary, you can spend all day at Versailles or just spend the morning at Versailles, using the afternoon to visit a few more places in Paris.\nPlan Your Visit to Versailles\nIn our\nGuide to Versailles,\nwe cover the best things to do at Versailles, how to get here, how to avoid the crowds, and ticket and tour options.\nHours:\nThe palace is closed Mondays; the palace is open at 9 am to 5:30 pm; the gardens and the park are open every day and are free to visit.\nCost:\n\u20ac21 to tour the palace; \u20ac28.50 for the palace, gardens, and the Musical Gardens and Musical Fountain Shows\nMuseum Pass:\nThe Museum Pass covers your entry into the palace, the Trianon, and the Queen\u2019s Hamlet. It does not cover the Musical Gardens. You will have to purchase this ticket separately (and you should do so in advance) for \u20ac10.50. Before you visit Versailles, you will need to book a free time slot to enter. Learn more\nhere.\nGetting here:\nTake RER C from Paris to Versailles. This journey takes approximately 45 minutes. If you purchase the\nParis Visite Pass\n(a transportation card) it covers the RER to and from Versailles.\nPowered by\nGetYourGuide\nOptions for your Afternoon in Paris\nIf you do not spend all day in Versailles and get back to Paris during the afternoon, here are several spots to visit.\nTake in the View from Montparnasse\nFor one of the best views of Paris, visit the observation deck of Montparnasse Tower. There are two levels to visit, the 56th floor, which is completely enclosed by windows, and the observation terrace on the roof. This is also completely enclosed by glass panels but there are a few strategic openings in the glass for your camera.\nView from Montparnasse\nHours & Price:\nwww.tourmontparnasse56.com\nYou can also reserve a roof top ticket with\nGetYourGuide.\nNote:\nIf you want to eat some of the best crepes in Paris, walk 5 minutes to\nLa Creperie de Josselin\n(11 am -11:30 pm, closed Monday and Tuesday).\nTake Your Pick from 2 Museums\nRodin Museum\nThis small museum features sculptures by Rodin. It\u2019s quick and fun to visit. If you are traveling with kids, this is a museum they may actually like. Just ask them to pose like the statues.\nRodin Museum\nWebsite:\nGet hours and pricing on the\nofficial website.\nRER:\nInvalides (line C) \u2013 perfect for taking the RER back to Paris from Versailles\nMetro:\nVarenne (line 13) and Invalides (line 8 and 13)\nCentre Pompidou\nThis is the largest modern art museum in Europe. It has an interesting design, with all of its plumbing and pipes located on the exterior of the museum, color-coded in vibrant colors. It\u2019s definitely a unique sight to see. This is large museum and you could wander here for hours. From the top level of the museum you are treated to another wonderful view of Paris.\nPompidou Centre\nWebsite:\nGet hours and pricing on the\nofficial website.\nMetro:\nRambuteau (line 11), Hotel de Ville (line 1 and 11), Chatelet (line 1, 4, 7, 11, and 14)\nVisit the Catacombs\nDescend under the streets of Paris and tour the labyrinth of tunnels lined with human bones. In the 18th century, cemeteries around Paris were cleared and the bones were moved to these underground tunnels. Now, this is the final resting place of six million Parisians.\nParis Catacombs\nThe Catacombs can have one of the longest lines in all of Paris. Waiting times can be as long as 3 hours. Only 200 people are permitted in the Catacombs at one time, so the line moves very slowly.\nBooking a ticket in advance is now mandatory and you can do so on the\nofficial Catacombs website\n(\u20ac31) or\njoin a skip-the-line tour.\nThe Catacombs are open Tuesday through Sunday from 9:45 am to 8:30 pm, last admission at 7:30 pm. The least crowded time of day to visit the Catacombs is the last two hours of the day.\nVisit P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery\nP\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery is one of the best known and most visited cemeteries in the world. A visit here may sound like a macabre way to spend an afternoon, but a stroll among the tombstones and mausoleums can be fascinating.\nP\u00e8re Lachaise\nP\u00e8re Lachaise is free to visit but if you want to get more out of the experience, you can take a guided tour.\nHours:\nDaily 8:00 am to 5:30 pm; on Saturday it opens at 8:30 am\nCost:\nFree\nMetro:\nPere Lachaise Line 2 and 3\nDinner and Drinks in Le Marais\nEnd the day with a visit to Le Marais, one of Paris\u2019 most interesting neighborhoods.\nIf you are looking for a budget meal, consider trying one of the falafel restaurants along\nRue de Rosiers\n. The most famous spot is\nL\u2019As du Falafel\n. We ate at\nMi-Va-Mi\n, another popular spot, simply because it was the only one open during our visit.\nIf you don\u2019t feel like eating falafel on your last night in Paris, there are many great cafes and restaurants in the area.\nTips to Help You Have the Best Experience\nLearn a Little French\nSure, you can get by with just speaking English, but being able to say a few things in French is polite and friendly. At a bare minimum, say\nbonjour\nwhen walking into a restaurant or shop. If it\u2019s evening, say\nbonsoir\n.\nIn my experience, trying to speak the local language opens you up to much more meaningful interactions with people. Even if you are not perfect or you make a mistake, your effort is appreciated.\nI am a big fan of\nFluenz\n, a software program that teaches several different languages and is perfect if you want to learn a little bit of conversational French.\nBeware of Pickpockets\nParis is very safe. Your chances of being a victim of violent crime are very low. However, pickpocketing is a problem in Paris. Our hotel staff warned us of pickpockets and\nthis article\nby Europe for Visitors has a lot of great tips that you should read, especially if this is your first time to Europe.\nMuseum Closings on Mondays and Tuesdays\nSeveral museums close on either Monday or Tuesday. Take note of this when planning your trip. You may have to adjust the order of these three days if you will be in Paris on a Monday or Tuesday.\nClosed on Monday:\nMusee d\u2019Orsay\nVersailles\nMusee Rodin\nClosed on Tuesday:\nLouvre\nMusee de l\u2019Orangerie\nPompidou Centre\nPlaces that are closed on Monday will have larger than normal crowds on Sunday and Tuesday. Places that are closed on Tuesday will have larger crowds on Monday and Wednesday. This is just something to be aware of when planning your time.\nHow to Adjust this 3 Days in Paris Itinerary\nIf day one of your three days in Paris also happens to be the day that you are arriving in the city, you will need to adjust day 1 of this Paris itinerary. Even if you arrive in the morning, there\u2019s a good chance that you will be exhausted, especially if you flew a red-eye flight from outside of Europe.\nOut of the big sites on day 1 (Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and the Arc de Triomphe) you may just want to plan on visiting two of them and save the third site for the afternoon of day 3.\nIf you only have 2 days in Paris, check out our\n2 Days in Paris Itinerary\nto learn how to plan your time.\nShould You Get the Museum Pass?\nAbsolutely! The Museum Pass covers your entrance fee into almost every site in this itinerary and it allows you to skip the ticket lines. Just be aware that it does not guarantee getting into every attraction without a line. During busy times, you still may have to queue for security.\nThe Museum Pass is only offered for 2 days (\u20ac70), 4 days (\u20ac90), and 6 days (\u20ac110). They do not have a 3-day option.\nI recommend getting the 4-day pass. If you visit everything I have listed (not including the optional museums on day 3), you will pay \u20ac107.50. Even though you don\u2019t use the pass all four days, you still save \u20ac17.50. If you visit another museum on the afternoon of day 3, that\u2019s an additional \u20ac13 to \u20ac14 savings.\nClick here\nfor full more information and instructions on how to obtain your pass.\nWhat About the Paris Pass?\nYou may also hear about something called the\nParis Pass\n. The 4-day pass includes the 4-day Museum Pass but this costs \u20ac254. It includes many attractions and tours, most of which are not listed on our itinerary.\nUnless you also plan on taking the hop-on hop-off bus tour, a walking tour, a Seine River cruise,\nand\nvisiting places like the Paris Aquarium, you will not get your money\u2019s worth.\nOur Recommendation\nPurchase the 4-day Museum Pass for \u20ac90 and a travel card that gives you unlimited rides on the metro, buses, etc.. There are several travel cards available.\nThe\nParis Visite Pass\ngives you unlimited rides on the metro, bus, RER, trams, and Montmarte funicular within a specific window of time.\nThe Paris Visite pass can be purchased for 1, 2, 3, or 5 days. It includes all 5 zones, including the Paris city center, Charles de Gualle airport, Orly Airport, the Palace of Versailles, and Disneyland.\nA 1-day pass costs \u20ac29.90, a 2-day pass costs \u20ac44.45, and a 3-day pass costs \u20ac62.30.\nThe\nParis Navigo Pass\nis a travel card that is used by locals in Paris. If you will be in Paris for several days, it might be cheaper than the Paris Visite pass. The Navigo pass gives you unlimited rides on the metro, bus, RER, trams, and Montmartre funicular. It costs \u20ac5 to purchase the card and then there is a weekly fare (\u20ac31.60 for zones 1-5).\nThe period of validity for the Paris Navigo Pass is sold in weeks (valid from Monday through Sunday). If your visit crosses over this period (for example, if you will be in Paris from Sunday through Tuesday) you will need two of these weekly fares, so the prices are similar to a Visite pass.\nYou can purchase your\nParis Visite Pass\nor\nNavigo Pass\nat the ticket booths in the metro stations (do this the first time you ride the metro). This will pay for your transportation on the metro, RER, bus, and the Montmartre funicular and will cover your trip to and from Versailles on the RER.\nMake Your Reservations in Advance\nHere are the attractions where we highly recommend making a reservation in advance, plus the link to the official website and GetYourGuide, just to make things a bit easier for you.\nGetYourGuide offers some advantages over the official websites. For some attractions, GetYourGuide tickets and tours can be cancelled up to 24 hours in advance and you get a full refund (but it\u2019s good to double check this, because there are exceptions). Any GYG tours and tickets you purchase are stored on their app, making it easier to organize your tickets in one spot. Finally, if you use GetYourGuide, you will load your credit card information into one website, rather than the long list below. We use GetYourGuide when we travel and have had nothing but positive experiences.\nEiffel Tower:\nOfficial website\n\u2013\nGetYourGuide\nThe Louvre:\nOfficial website\n\u2013\nGetYourGuide\nArc de Triomphe:\nOfficial website\n\u2013\nGetYourGuide\nSeine River Cruise:\nGetYourGuide\nSainte-Chapelle & the Conciergerie:\nOfficial website\n\u2013\nGetYourGuide\nNotre Dame Cathedral:\nOfficial website\nMus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay:\nOfficial website\n\u2013\nGetYourGuide\nThe Palace and Gardens of Versailles:\nOfficial website\n\u2013\nGetYourGuide\nIf you plan to visit the Catacombs, the Pompidou Centre, or the Rodin Museum on the afternoon of day 3, we also recommend purchasing these tickets in advance. And of course, don\u2019t forget to make your dinner reservations. Check out our\nParis Restaurants and Rooftop Bars\nfor recommendations.\nNote: If you have the Museum Pass, you do not need to purchase tickets for the Louvre, the Arc de Triomphe, Sainte-Chapelle, the Conciergerie, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, the Palace of Versailles. However, you will need to reserve a time slot for the Louvre, Sainte-Chapelle, and the Conciergerie.\nPlanning Your Trip\nIn our Paris Travel guide, we cover everything you need to know to plan a trip to Paris. This includes must-see sights, more sample itineraries, where to stay, where to eat, rooftop bars with panoramic views of Paris, plus the logistics that come with planning your trip.\nParis Travel Guide\nHow to Plan a Trip to Paris: Tips & Itineraries for Your First Visit\nEverything you need to know to plan your dream trip to Paris.\nBest Time to Visit Paris\nIn general, spring and fall are the best times of the year to visit Paris. During this time, the weather is great for sightseeing and crowds tend to be lower than the busy summer months. But here is a breakdown by season of what you can expect in Paris:\nWINTER:\nParis is cold during the winter months, with average high\u2019s ranging from 5 to 7\u00b0C (mid-40\u2019s Fahrenheit) and the average low hovering just above freezing. Rainfall is slightly higher than most of the other seasons, with Paris getting about 8 days of rainfall per month in the winter. Skies tend to be overcast on a regular basis.\nSPRING:\nThe spring brings warmer temperatures and clearer skies. In early April, the average high temperature is still on the cooler side (about 16\u00b0C or 60\u00b0F). The average high in May is 19\u00b0C (66\u00b0F) but it can be much warmer than this, on unusually warm days. April is a beautiful month to visit Paris, when the trees begin getting leaves and flowers are in bloom.\nSUMMER:\nSummers are warm with sunny skies. The average high is 24\u00b0C (76\u00b0F) but during a heat wave, it can get up to 38\u00b0C (100\u00b0F). This doesn\u2019t happen every year, but it is a possibility. Crowds are at their highest during the summer.\nFALL:\nIn fall, the weather turns cooler and rain chances increase slightly over the summer months. October is another beautiful month to visit Paris, with cool weather and a hint of fall colors.\nVERDICT:\nOur favorite months to visit Paris are April and October. The weather is wonderful and crowds aren\u2019t at their peak levels.\nWhere to Stay in Paris\nWe have visited Paris four times. These are hotels we recommend, either because we had a great experience or because they have a prime location and an excellent review score.\nHotel Brighton.\nThis is where we stayed on our first trip to Paris and we still talk about this hotel. Over the years, we have recommended this hotel to other family, friends, and readers of this website, and they have all had very similar, memorable experiences. Located on Rue de Rivoli right across from Tuileries Garden, you will be able to see the Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral, the Eiffel Tower, and the Arc de Triomphe from your room. Request a high floor, preferably one with a balcony, for the best experience.\nLe Relais Saint Honor\u00e9.\nWe stayed in this lovely, mid-range hotel on our 3rd visit to Paris. Our favorite thing about this small, boutique hotel is its excellent location. The Louvre, Tuileries Garden, Place de la Concorde, and Palais-Garnier are all within a 10-minute walk. The Tuileries and Pyramides metro stations are less than 5 minutes away. The rooms are small but tastefully decorated and the staff is friendly and speaks English. You don\u2019t get the awesome view in this hotel but we loved the friendly staff and the location.\nApartments Du Louvre.\nIf you are family, small group, or simply prefer an apartment over a hotel room, Apartments Du Louvre has several great options. This small property offers one, two, and three-bedroom apartments that come with a kitchen, air conditioning, and most rooms have city views. This property is located in the 2\nnd\narrondissement, just steps away from Le Marais, within walking distance of the Louvre, and a short walk to several of Paris\u2019 handiest metro stations.\nH\u00f4tel Le Presbyt\u00e8re.\nThis 3-star hotel\u00a0has it all: beautifully decorated rooms, a prime location, excellent review score, plus it even offers a Junior Suite that can accommodate up to 5 people, perfect for families. It is located in the southwest corner of Le Marais, just steps away from Notre Dame, the Louvre, and Ch\u00e2telet, one of the best metro hubs in the city. If you are a family traveling on a budget and want to stay in the heart of Paris near the top attractions, this is a great hotel to consider.\nFor more recommendations on where to stay, take a look at our Paris Hotel Guide.

This gives you just enough time to visit the highlights, explore a few neighborhoods, and dine at a few restaurants. If you have three days, take a look at our 3 Day Paris Itinerary.\nWith 2 days in Paris, you can see the main highlights in two very busy days. It will be a whirlwind of a visit and booking your entrance tickets in advance will be key in maximizing your time, but what an amazing 2 days it will be!\nWhat is the best way to get around Paris?\nThe Paris metro is cheap, fast, and very efficient. While in the city center, you are never more than a 5-minute walk from a metro station. It costs roughly \u20ac18 per day for unlimited rides on the metro, so you can travel around Paris without spending a lot of money. I recommend the Paris Metro Map and Routes app (available for free in the Apple App Store) or something similar, which gives you real-time schedules and helps plan your metro routes through the city.\nIs Paris expensive to visit?\nYes, Paris can be expensive to visit, if you stay in 5-star hotels and dine at Michelin starred restaurants. But you can also have a great experience and visit Paris\u2019 top sights with some money saving tricks.\nThere are plenty of highly rated hostels and budget hotels to help keep accommodation costs low. Rather than dining at restaurants, put together picnic lunches and dinners at the market. Purchase the Museum Pass to visit the attractions with a discount and skip the ticket line. Riding the metro is very budget friendly. Without splurging on meals or accommodations, it is possible to tour Paris for \u20ac100 per person per day.\nHappy travels!

To kick off the series, I\u2019m discussing visiting Paris in a day.\u00a0 While a one day trip to Paris is not ideal, and there is certainly little opportunity to check out all the\nbest Paris Instagram spots\nit is still possible to hit a number of the big ticket items and have a fun day during a day trip in Paris.\nThis post contains affiliate links.  As an Amazon associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\nClick here to read my full disclosure\nTable Of Contents\nWhat to buy on a one day visit to Paris\nWhere to eat when you visit Paris in one day\nIf you prefer a guided tour, it is possible to book Paris in a day guided tours.  I recommend the excellent Take Walks:\nStart off at Notre Dame Cathedral.\u00a0 While Notre Dame remains closed you can still take in its grandeur from the outside.  It is also possible to do an interactive virtual visit.  Depending on what time you leave Notre Dame, you can either go to Shakespeare & Co. (opens at 10.00am Monday to Friday and 11am on weekends) or Ste Chapelle (opens at 9.30am).\u00a0 If you are super early in starting your day, or don\u2019t want to linger long at Notre Dame you will have plenty of time to admire the river views.\u00a0 Turn left from the Notre Dame courtyard, then walk towards the back of the cathedral.\u00a0 At the end of the island (Ile de la Cit\u00e9) there are some lovely views back over the Ile St Louis and the Left Bank.\u00a0 Then take the first bridge (more lovely views back over Notre Dame and the river) and enjoy a wander along to Shakespeare & Co.\nShakespeare & Co is probably the most famous book shop in Paris.\u00a0 Even if books aren\u2019t your thing it\u2019s a pretty shop to enjoy from the outside.\u00a0 If you are looking for some cheap and easy gifts or souvenirs, the last time I visited Shakespeare & Co they were selling cute calico book bags for a few Euros each.\nAfter your visit to Shakespeare & Co continue left out of the shop (therefore heading west) towards Place St Michel, and cross the Pont St Michel where Sainte Chapelle will be right in front of you on the left.\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t bought your Museum Pass or skip the lines ticket you can buy a Museum Pass at the\ntabac\nat 5 bvde du Palais.\nIt is likely you will need to queue at Ste Chapelle, regardless of what time you get there.\u00a0 The first queue will be for security, which you will need to queue for even with a pass.\u00a0 If you have a Museum Pass or skip the line ticket (you can\nbuy Paris skip the line tickets here\n) you can then go in without queuing at the second queue to buy a ticket.\nThe interior of Ste Chapelle\nSte Chapelle is certainly one of my favorite places to visit in Paris, so do make sure you spend plenty of time enjoying its tiny details (both up and downstairs).\nThe\nUltimate Paris Address Book\n2024\nis your insider address book to Paris with 100 pages and 500 places to sleep, eat, shop and see.\u00a0 Listed by arrondissement,\nThe Ultimate Paris Address Book 2024\nis the perfect accompaniment to a traditional guide book to plan your trip to Paris.\u00a0 From where to find a charming country lane in the middle of Paris to ice cream and chocolates from a multi Michelin starred legend,\nThe Ultimate Paris Address Book\nwill help you say\nau revoir\nto the tourist traps and\nbonjour\nto the real Paris.\nBuy your copy now >>\nAfter Ste Chapelle it\u2019s a very short stroll to the Conciergerie.\u00a0 The Conciergerie is famous for its time as a prison during the French Revolution.\u00a0 While it was the final home of many aristocrats it is most famous for being where Marie Antoinette was imprisoned.\u00a0 I like the Conciergerie because of its starkness and austerity compared to its neighbour Ste Chapelle.\u00a0 There are some interesting documents and artifacts, as well as Revolution scene recreations, which makes the Conciergerie an interesting place to visit, particularly for those interested in history.\nOur next stop is the Louvre.\u00a0 To reach the Louvre from the Conciergerie, turn left out of the Conciergerie and continue left again staying on the Ile de la Cit\u00e9 until you come to an \u201cold\u201d looking bridge on your right.\u00a0 This is the Pont Neuf, or new bridge, actually one of the oldest bridges in Paris.\nCross the bridge, again, taking time to enjoy the views as you cross.\u00a0 Then turn left and continue on.\u00a0 The Louvre is on your right just near the next bridge (the Pont des Arts).\u00a0 There are multiple entrances into the Louvre courtyards and its main entrance at the Pyramid.\u00a0 If there is a queue at the Pyramid (and there may well be), never fear.\u00a0 There are far less crowded entrances if you have a Museum Pass at the Museum Pass/Group Entrance in the Pavilion Richelieu (under the arches between the Pyramid and the rue de Rivoli) or at the underground Mall entrance (accessed via the Carrousel de Louvre shopping mall on rue de Rivoli).  Unless you have a Museum or Paris Pass you must book a timed entry ticket for the Louvre.\nAre you planning a trip to France?  My France Travel Planning Facebook group is a vibrant and friendly group where you can ask questions, learn from others and get great advice.\nYou can join here >>\nIt\u2019s easy to spend more than a day in the Louvre, so with only a one day visit to Paris having a plan to make the most of your visit to the Louvre is key.\u00a0 Study your guidebook well (there are some good choices available at the end of this post) and then grab an English language Information Guide at the information desk under the Pyramid.\u00a0 You will need to check your bag if it is larger than a small handbag/purse.\nMost visitors will spend about 2hours on a basic tour of the Louvre regardless of whether you are on a 1 day Paris itinerary or are staying longer.\u00a0 Adjust your time according to your level of interest (or the weather).\u00a0 Allow a little extra time if you choose to eat in one of the museum caf\u00e9s or shop at the Louvre shop.\nLeave the Louvre via the Pyramid exit and cross the road to enter the Tuileries garden.\u00a0 The Tuileries is a perfect spot to do some people watching and enjoy a little picnic late lunch or afternoon tea (choose something to take away from one of the Louvre caf\u00e9s or buy something sweet across the road at Angelina\u2019s on rue de Rivoli.\nFrom the Tuileries it\u2019s a short Metro trip to the Trocadero to enjoy the views of the Eiffel Tower before you go up.\u00a0 Again, avoid the worst of the queues by purchasing a skip the queue ticket.\nPurchase your Eiffel Tower skip the line ticket here >>\nWhat to buy on a one day visit to Paris\nUnless you take my Paris one day tour shopping itinerary below, you won\u2019t have much opportunity for shopping on this itinerary unfortunately.\u00a0 While there are plenty of souvenir shops and stands at all the places on my itinerary, I\u2019m suggesting you pass on them.\u00a0 Instead, the Louvre has a lovely shop with a range of goods from a Euro or so up to thousands of Euros for some of the very special pieces.\nOn rue de Rivoli just opposite the Tuileries you can choose from a range of food items at Angelina\u2019s (perfect for a snack on the way home at the end of the day) or just along the street from Angelina\u2019s is a large book shop with an excellent range of English books about Paris and French culture.\nWhere to eat when you visit Paris in one day\nAgain, there are plenty of food choices on this itinerary.\u00a0 Some are good, some are terrible.\u00a0 For reliable food at a reasonable price buy something at a bakery or patisserie and picnic, or eat at the Louvre.\u00a0 There are plenty of fast food options around Notre Dame and Ste Chapelle.  Just don\u2019t expect them to be particularly cheap or particularly French.  My Ultimate Paris Address Book ebook also features a range of restaurants in this part of Paris.\nYou can pick up your copy here >>\nOne day Paris itinerary with children\nParis is an easy destination with little ones and my basic one day trip to Paris is easily adapted to accommodate children.\nRather than starting at Notre Dame I would start at the Eiffel Tower, then take the\nbateaux mouches\ndown to Notre Dame.\u00a0 It\u2019s a fun, relaxing way to visit Paris in a day.\u00a0 If your children are a little older and are interested in animals, dinosaurs and science, stay on the\nbateau mouche\npast Notre Dame and go to the Natural History Museum.\nThere are a lot of animals preserved in jars, which younger children may find a bit confronting.\u00a0 We took MissG when she was six without any problems though.\nWith this option, skip the Conciergerie and save some time by making your Ste Chapelle visit a little shorter.  Then end your day with a short visit to the Louvre and a longer visit to the Tuileries for a run around\nBook you bateaux mouches tickets here >>\nOne day in Paris:\u00a0 itinerary for the art lover\nThis itinerary can easily be adapted for the art lover even if you only have one day to spend in Paris.\u00a0 Forget everything else except the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay.\u00a0 Spend half a day in each.\nEven the building at the Musee d\u2019Orsay is artistic\nOr for a really special day, visit Ste Chapelle (it really is a work of art), the Louvre and the Orsay.\u00a0 If you have the option of visiting Paris on a day where these are open late you can spend a very enjoyable long day indulging your passion.\u00a0 If more modern art is your thing, pick one out of the Orsay and the Louvre, and then spend the rest of your day at the Pompidou Centre (not far from the Louvre, so works best if you pass on the Orsay).\nBook your Paris Museum tickets here >>\nOne day Paris itinerary for the garden lover\nThose who love gardens can still enjoy a day in Paris without spending all day travelling around town.\u00a0 Instead of going to the Conciergerie, after you\u2019ve been to St Chapelle cross the road and head down rue de Lutece.\u00a0 At the end of the street on the left is the sweetest flower market and nursery (on Sundays this market is a bird market).\nObviously amend your time to accommodate a nice long visit to the Tuileries, or head north from the Tuileries and visit the gardens at the Palais Royale (only about 5minutes north of the Louvre).\u00a0 Although they look like private gardens, they are open to the public and are truly lovely.\nWhile it works better on a two day trip to Paris, if a\nvisit to Giverny\nis a must do, and you only have one day in Paris, it is possible to visit Giverny as a one day trip from Paris.\u00a0 Catch an early train from the Gare St Lazare to arrive at Giverny as close to opening time as possible.\u00a0 When you board the navette (the little bus that takes you from the station to Giverny) pick up a timetable for your return.\u00a0 Resist the temptation to spend ages in the gift shop (it\u2019s terribly expensive apart from anything else) and enjoy your visit to the house and gardens.\u00a0 Assuming the gardens are not too busy, you can possibly be back in Paris in the early to mid afternoon if you bypass the village.\u00a0 Then resume your visit to Paris.\u00a0 This itinerary works best if you travel independently rather than doing an organised trip.\nOne day Paris itinerary for the food lover\nThere are plenty of\nfood options\navailable on my one day itinerary for Paris, but not a lot of gourmet or special options.\nBook a table at Angelina\u2019s in advance and enjoy lunch or afternoon tea.\u00a0 There are other nearby restaurant options in my Ultimate Paris Address Book ebook.\nYou can buy your copy here >>\nMy other suggested food option is to plan the order of your day to be in the Eiffel Tower area at meal time (a late afternoon/early evening visit to the Tower, then dinner would work well for example).\u00a0 A few blocks away from the Eiffel Tower are plenty of good French restaurants at reasonable prices in the rue St Dominique/rue Cler neighbourhood.\u00a0 If you are interested in this option, I strongly suggest the Rick Steves Paris guide.\u00a0 Rick Steves\u2019 Paris itinerary covers the rue Cler neighbourhood in some detail:\n#1 best seller\nRick Steves Paris (Travel Guide)\nBuy on Amazon\nPrices pulled from the Amazon Product Advertising API on:\nProduct prices and availability are accurate as of the date/time indicated and are subject to change. Any price and availability information displayed on [relevant Amazon Site(s), as applicable] at the time of purchase will apply to the purchase of this product.\nFor a very special Paris meal, book a table at Jules Verne at the Eiffel Tower (needs to be booked months in advance), or try\nAtelier de Joel Robuchon\nin the nearby 6th arrondissement.\nWhile my 1 day trip to Paris itinerary is focussed on sightseeing, and there are so many places to visit in one day, I know some people will just want to shop.\u00a0 For a day or half day\u2019s shopping in Paris as part of a one day trip to Paris, I\u2019m suggesting staying on the Right Bank and either hit the Grands Magasins \u2013 Au Printemps and\nGaleries Lafayettes\nor the Marais.\u00a0 The passages in the area north of the Louvre heading up as far as Boulevarde Haussman have some interesting small shops and make a good alternative to the Marais if it is raining.\u00a0 The Grands Magasins are definitely your best bet if you want to shop in Paris on a Sunday.\nIf you are staying in Paris for longer, you can read my\n3 day Paris itinerary here >>\nFind my recommended\nguidebooks for France here >>\nShare or save for later\n15\nshares\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n15\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

I\u2019ve used that passion and knowledge to devise an itinerary that covers the best of Paris in 4 days.\nWith this itinerary, you\u2019ll see the most impressive Paris landmarks, admire priceless works of art, explore charming neighbourhoods \u2013 and, of course, eat delicious French cuisine. I\u2019ll also show you a few places that are off the beaten path.\nRead on for all the information and inspiration you need to book the perfect Paris itinerary.\nDisclosure: This article contains affiliate links.

Any earnings go towards the upkeep of this blog, which I appreciate.\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nAbout This Itinerary For 4 Days In Paris\nThis is actually the second 4-day Paris itinerary I have written. I wrote one for solo travellers in this post on\nsolo travel in Paris\n.\nThere are some similarities between the two itineraries, but I wrote this one from scratch, not looking at the first one (it had been a while since I wrote it, and I\u2019ve been to Paris a couple more times since), so it is different. However, feel free to check out the other one for an alternative to this one.\nThings to note about this itinerary for 4 days in Paris:\nIt\u2019s pretty busy!\nI have assumed you\u2019ll want to make the most of only a few days in Paris, so I have created a fairly full itinerary, with several things to do in the mornings and afternoons each day.\nIt involves a fair bit of walking\n. A large part of Paris\u2019s appeal, for me, is in the beauty and discovery to be found in the\nstreets of Paris\n. You\u2019ll want comfortable shoes (no one wears fancy shoes in Paris anyway \u2013 that\u2019s only in movies and on TV).\nI do suggest you use the Metro\n. I don\u2019t think you can walk\neverywhere\nin Paris, so follow the tips for using the Metro that I will give you at the end of this itinerary.\nIt\u2019s all in Paris\n. There are some great\nday trips from Paris\n, including to the Palace of Versailles and\nReims\n. But with only four days in Paris, I suggest you stick to the city and leave the day trips for a longer visit.\nQuite a few activities are outdoors\n, so if your weather forecast is very rainy or cold, you might want to check my post about\nParis in winter\n, which has ideas of things to do in Paris when the weather is bad \u2013 it might be you need to swap out some of the outdoor things in this Paris itinerary for more indoor things.\nBook attractions in advance\n: in order to guarantee you can do them, you will want to book some of the popular activities in advance. I\u2019ll circle back to what these are, with links, at the end.\nItinerary For 4 Days In Paris \u2013 In A Nutshell\nOK, here\u2019s a very high-level overview of what I recommend in this itinerary for 4 days in Paris:\nDay 1\n: Eiffel Tower & The Sights Of The Seine \u2013 including Notre-Dame cathedral and Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay.\nDay 2\n: The Intellectual Left Bank \u2013 including Saint-Germain, Jardin du Luxembourg & the Latin Quarter.\nDay 3\n: Shopping, Gold Leaf & Cobble Streets \u2013 covered passages, Les Grands Magasins, Palais Garnier & Montmartre.\nDay 4\n: Grand Old Paris \u2013 Le Marais, the Louvre, Petit Palais and Arc de Triomphe for a showstopper finale.\nItinerary For 4 Days In Paris \u2013 in Detail\nNow, let\u2019s get into the details of this epic itinerary for 4 days in Paris.\nDay 1 \u2013 Eiffel Tower & The Sights Of The Seine\nI suggest you focus on the major sights around the Seine on your first day in Paris. This does make this a rather expensive day, as there are several attractions to pay for. But the later days in this itinerary are cheaper, don\u2019t worry!\nMorning\nTrocad\u00e9ro\nWe\u2019re going to start with the Eiffel Tower, because, well, you just have to. It\u2019s the law in Paris, I think.\nBut before actually climbing the tower, I suggest you start with a\nview\nof it.\nTrocad\u00e9ro at dawn\nStart as early in the day as you can and take the Metro to\nTrocad\u00e9ro\n, which is an elevated plaza, with a sweeping view of Paris, dominated by the Eiffel Tower. It\u2019s a popular, busy spot (there will likely be several amateur photo shoots happening!), but the light is just gorgeous at sunrise.\nOnce you\u2019ve had your fill of the view, take down the steps to the right of the fountains and wander down the path towards the Eiffel Tower. If you come to\nParis in Spring\n, you\u2019ll have the added bonus of cherry blossoms in bloom in the gardens. In fact, this is one of the\nbest places to see cherry blossoms in Paris\n.\nTrocad\u00e9ro Gardens\nThe Eiffel Tower\nCross the Seine at\nPont d\u2019I\u00e9na\nand head to the tower to get a closer look.\nThe\nEiffel Tower\nis the most recognisable and enduring icon of Paris, so it\u2019s funny to think that there was opposition to it when it was first built in 1889. One derisory commentator called it a \u2018truly tragic street lamp\u2019!\nIt was built for the 1889 World\u2019s Fair and at 330 meters high, it set a record as the world\u2019s highest monument.\nIf you want to go up the tower, you\u2019ll want to book tickets in advance and can choose between various options including\nclimbing the stairs\n,\nsummit access\nand a\nguided tour\n. I\u2019ve done the stair-climb to the first level and also the view from the summit, which is pretty cool (but can be chilly!).\nRue de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 & the Eiffel Tower in the morning sun\nIf you prefer to stay on the ground, the\nChamps de Mars\ngardens around the tower offer plenty of different vantage points. There\u2019s also a classic photo op spot on Rue de l\u2019Universit\u00e9.\nSeine Boat Tour \u2013 Batobus\nOnce you\u2019ve had your fill of the famous iron tower, head back towards the river because your next activity is a boat ride on the\nSeine\n!\nA\nBatobus\non the Seine\nThere are lots of different kinds of Seine River tours available, and I\u2019ve done a few. The one I recommend for this itinerary is\nBatobus Paris\n\u2013 because it\u2019s good value for money and really flexible.\nBatobus is kind of like a river bus. The way it works is there are boats continually making a circuit of the river, stopping at various points along the way. If you have a ticket, you can hop on and hop off as many times as you like, for as long as your ticket is valid (tickets are for 1 day or 2 days).\nI recommend you\nbuy a one-day Batobus pass\n, which you can do online via Get Your Guide, and start by taking the boat from the Eiffel Tower stop to Notre Dame. This stretch of the route takes you past some stunning landmarks along the Seine, including\nPont Alexandre III\n,\nMus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Institut de France\nand\nPont Neuf\n.\nThe Seine\nIt will take about 45 minutes from the Eiffel Tower to get to Notre Dame \u2013 and heads up, there are no toilets on board. But don\u2019t worry, there is a good (though not free, it costs \u20ac2) place to use the loo when you get to Notre Dame.\nRead more about what you can see at each of the nine\nBatobus Paris stops\n.\nCathedral de Notre Dame\nParis\u2019s most famous church is in the heart of the old part of Paris:\n\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9\nthe largest island in the Seine.\nNotre Dame\nwas built in the 12\nth\nand 13\nth\ncenturies and renovated significantly in the 19\nth\nCentury (after it faced calls to be demolished, which thankfully were overruled). It remains one of the best examples of Gothic architecture in Paris.\nRecently re-opened to the public after a 5-year renovation following a fore in 2019, it\u2019s free to visit the cathedral, but you\u2019ll need to reserve a spot on their\nofficial website\n. You can also take\nguided tours\n.\nCathedral de Notre Dame\nLunch\nFor lunch, I suggest grabbing a\ncr\u00eape\nfrom one of the food stalls near Notre Dame \u2013 there\u2019s always one there and the cr\u00eapes and delicious and filling.\nThere are plenty of restaurants just across the river on the left bank, but so many of them look like tourist traps and have bad online ratings \u2013 so I tend to avoid them.\nAfternoon\nSainte-Chapelle\nThere\u2019s also another Gothic church you can visit nearby on \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9:\nSainte-Chapelle\n. This church was built in 1248 to house the relic of Christ\u2019s Crown of Thorns and is known for its spectacular stained-glass windows.\nIf there\u2019s one church in Paris that you go inside, make it this one: the interior is just stunning! There are just two parts to the chapel, so it doesn\u2019t take long to view. The tall colourful windows and star-strewn midnight blue ceiling are really something special.\nSainte-Chapelle\nSeine Boat Tour Continues \u2013 Batobus\nIf you\nwant\n, from here, you could wander into the Left Bank and explore more of the old Paris: the Latin Quarter. But I suggest you do that another day \u2013 and instead, make the most of your\nBatobus ticket\nby getting back on a boat.\nBecause the Batobus route is like a very elongated circle, if you catch another boat at Notre Dame, it will continue in the direction you were going before, east toward Jardin des Plantes stop, where it will turn around, and head back down the river, this time staying close to the right bank.\nAlong this stretch of the river, look out for\n\u00cele Saint-Louis\n, the medieval towers of the\nConciergerie\nand\nThe Louvre\n.\nConciergerie (on the left)\nTo get to your next stop, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, you can stay on the boat even after it gets to the Eiffel Tower and turns around \u2013 and then get off right at the\nMus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay\nstop. This stretch of the Batobus route should take about an hour and 25 minutes.\nOr, an alternative is you could get off at the\nLouvre\nstop, and then cross the river on Pont Royal to get to Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay on foot. This option takes only 40 minutes on the Batobus, plus a ten-minute walk.\nMus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay\nThis might be my favourite art gallery in Paris!\nI love its architecture. The\nMus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay\nbuilding was originally designed to be a train station \u2013 which makes sense when you see its cavernous atrium with an arched ceiling and ornate clock. The clock window on the top floor is also pretty special.\nAnd I\nreally\nlove the top floor collection of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings, including works by Monet, Degas, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. There are so many treasures here.\nMus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay\nDinner\nAfter you\u2019re done at the Museum, you might be ready for some rich French food for dinner.\nI don\u2019t know anywhere near Musee D\u2019Orsay, but one of the best traditional French bistros I have tried in Paris is\nLes Philosophes\n.\nIf you\u2019re in Paris in summer, when the last river bus departs at 9:30 pm, you\u2019ll be able to get to Les Philosophes by Batobus (getting off at H\u00f4tel de Ville stop), followed by a walk.\nIt\u2019s a cute little place with a classic menu \u2013 perfect for ending your first day in Paris.\nFrench Onion soup at Les Philosophes\nI went full-on indulgence when I ate here: French onion soup to start, followed by Boeuf Bourguignon and Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e to finish. When in France, right?\nDay 2 \u2013 The Intellectual Left Bank\nDay 2 of your itinerary for 4 days in Paris has fewer paid-for attractions and more walking, as you explore the intellectual Left Bank of Paris \u2013 \u2018where Paris learned to think\u2019.\nMorning\nJardin Du Luxembourg\nStart your day by having a peaceful wander in one of the nicest parks in Paris:\nJardin du Luxembourg\nin the 6\nth\narrondissement. If you want a breakfast pastry to take with you, there are several options on rue de Fleuris.\nLuxembourg Gardens\nHighlights of Jardin Du Luxembourg to look out for:\nLuxembourg Palace\n, once a royal palace and home to the mother of King Louis XIII, Marie de Medici, is now used by the French government for the Senat (though you can still do tours of the palace).\nMedici Fountain\n, a monumental fountain built in 1630 (a very popular photo spot).\nGrand Bassin\n: the central pond, which has lots of metal chairs around it, which are perfect for lounging.\nQueens of France\n: many white marble statues of historical queens of France are set against the trees, facing into the basin. I really like these statues.\nA bandstand\n, that sometimes has live performances.\nFlower gardens\n, mainly in the west and south-west of the park.\nA miniature version of the\nStatue of Liberty\n, the original of which is in\nNew York City\nTennis courts\n& basketball courts.\nWhilst there\u2019s a lot here that is unequivocally beautiful, what I like most about this park is how it feels like part of the community. When I first came here, I sat on a bench and watched some people play tennis. And on my most recent visit to Paris, I loved seeing the people practise Tai Chi under the trees in the mornings. It has a very chill vibe.\nSaint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s\nAfter exploring Luxembourg Gardens, head north towards Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s.\nOn the way along Rue Bonaparte, you\u2019ll pass the impressively large and oddly uneven church\n\u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice\n.\nThe non-matching towers of \u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice\nSaint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s\nis known best for the intellectuals who gathered here in the 1950s and 60s. At that time, this neighbourhood became a hub for writers, filmmakers, musicians and thinkers, including philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir and filmmakers Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut.\nHere you\u2019ll also find Paris\u2019s oldest church,\nEglise de Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s\n. It dates from the 6\nth\ncentury and was once a crypt for the kings of France. The church contains the tomb of Ren\u00e9 Descartes, an important 17th-century philosopher, scientist and mathematician.\nLunch\nGrab lunch at one of the iconic Saint-Germain caf\u00e9s, where those intellectuals would meet and debate:\nLes Deux Magots\nand\nCaf\u00e9 de Flore\n.\nHeads up\n: these cafes are pricey and you might need to queue for a table, but they\u2019re such classic Parisian cafes, I think it\u2019s worth it.\nClassic Parisian cafe, Les Deux Magots\nAfternoon\nLatin Quarter\nAfter lunch, wander east and into the\nLatin Quarter\n. I promised we\u2019d come back to it, didn\u2019t it?\nOn the way, pop your head into\nCr du Commerce Saint-Andr\u00e9\n, one of the oldest\ncovered passages of Paris\n, where you can still see the original cobblestones \u2013 now very uneven.\nThe Latin Quarter takes its name from the language taught in schools here in the middle ages and it is one of the oldest districts in the city.\nTake your time exploring this area during the afternoon, stopping in cafes as often as you need (it\u2019s the Parisian way).\nOdette\nJardin des Plantes\nTake your pick from the Latin Quarter highlights, which include:\nRue du Chat Qui P\u00eache\nis the narrowest street in Paris and a reminder of how Paris\u2019s streets used to be before the widespread Haussmann redesign in the 19th Century.\nNear the river, there are some very quaint establishments including\nShakespeare & Company\nbookshop,\nAbbey Bookshop\nand\nOdette Caf\u00e9\n, which has a great view of Notre Dame.\nSquare Ren\u00e9 Viviani\nis a cute square near Shakespeare & Company.\nSorbonne University\n, which was founded in the 13th century.\nPanth\u00e9on\n\u2013 a huge, imposing church that houses the remains of author Victor Hugo.\nArab World Institute\n\u2013 an exhibition of Arabic culture, housed in a modern building with attractive decorative windows.\nGrand Mosque of Paris\n, which you can tour to enjoy the tiled gardens.\nJardin des Plantes\n\u2013 extensive and impressive botanical gardens near the\nNatural History museum\n(Grande galerie de l\u2019\u00e9volution). This garden a good place to chill if your feet need a rest. It\u2019s also another good place to see\ncherry blossoms in Paris\nin April.\nColl\u00e8ge des Bernardins\n\u2013 a bright airy example of Gothic architecture.\nRue Mouffetard\n\u2013 a long road that dates from Roman times, with lots of great places to eat along it.\nColl\u00e8ge des Bernardins\nArab World Institute\nOld & New in the Latin Quarter\nDinner\nThere\u2019s a great restaurant at the end of Rue Mouffetard and I really enjoyed my food there.\nCave La Bourgogne\nhas a rustic wooden interior and a simple but delicious menu. I had salmon, served with rice \u2013 the fish was tender, sweet and delicious.\nCave La Bourgogne\nIt\u2019s a good place to have a relaxed, low-key dinner to end your second day in Paris.\nDay 3 \u2013 Shopping, Gold Leaf & Cobble Streets\nDay 3 of this itinerary for 4 days in Paris will give you a flavour of two historical ways to shop in Paris: the\ncovered passages\nof early-mid the 19\nth\ncentury and the\ngrands magasins\n(department stores) that became popular in the late 19\nth\nCentury. We\u2019ll also visit the ostentatious Paris Opera and explore the villagey cobbled streets of Montmartre.\nAnd on the shopping thing: if you want to shop, you can. But if you\u2019re not interested, that\u2019s also fine: the main attraction for me is actually the architecture of these stores.\nMorning\nCovered Passages\nThe\ncovered passages of Paris\nare one of my favourite features of the city \u2013 so much so that I have visited every single one! I feel like this makes me qualified to recommend visiting a couple of them during your trip.\nIn the early to mid-19\nth\ncentury, covered passages were built in Paris as a more pleasant shopping experience for wealthy patrons than the dirty Paris streets. These\npassages couverts\nwere pedestrian walkways with shops and cafes, protected from the elements by vaulted ceilings, typically made of iron and glass.\nBy around 1850, there were over 150 of them, but then the ambitious Haussmann redesign of Paris came and the creation of new boulevards and mansion buildings destroyed many of them.\nI suggest a visit to 2-3 of my favourite covered passages:\nPassages Verdeau\n,\nJouffroy\nand\nPanoramas\nrun on from one another, so you could enjoy them one after the other.\nPassage des Panoramas\nPassage Verdeau\nAll three have an old-world charm and contain quaint independent shops and cafes. They also each have a slight speciality: Passage Verdeau for art shops & rare books; Passage Jouffroy for rare books and prints and Passage des Panoramas for vintage stamps and other collectable shops.\nFor more info on each of them (and all the other covered passages), check my comprehensive guide to the\nbest covered passages of Paris\n.\nPalais Garnier\nIt\u2019s a 10-15 minute walk from Passage des Panoramas to\nPalais Garnier\n(also called Op\u00e9ra Garnier), one of the grandest, most ostentatious buildings in Paris. It\u2019s impressive from the outside, displayed proudly at the end of\nAvenue de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra\n.\nBut the real treat, in my opinion, is the interior, which has elegant twisting staircases, ornate balconies, mosaics and an intensely opulent Grand Foyer.\u00a0 This long hall is festooned with painted panels, chandeliers and gold leaf.\nGrand Foyer\nPalais Garnier stairway\nPalais Garnier is a working opera house, so you could have the full experience by going to an opera performance. However, for less money, you can also do\nself-guided\nor\nguided tours of the Palais Garnier interior\nduring the day.\nIt\u2019s very cool to explore this historic, opera house, which was built in 1875 and is perhaps most famous for being the setting of The Phantom of the Opera.\nGaleries Lafayette\nPalais Garnier is just across the street from your next stop: another showpiece of fancy Paris architecture:\nGaleries Lafayette\n.\nThere are several old department stores (or\ngrands magasins\n) in Paris and Galeries Lafayette is the most interesting, in my opinion. There are a lot of luxury and designer brands on sale here, so you could do some shopping if that is your thing. However, the reason I have recommended a visit here is its two main attractions: the stained-glass cupola and the rooftop terrace.\nGaleries Lafayette\u2019s colourful and ornate cupula is just amazing \u2013 it\u2019s so extravagant! Stand in the middle of the cosmetics floor and look up to get a good view. Or find one of the balconies on the 2nd floor to appreciate the balconies that ring the atrium.\nAnd the rooftop terrace is one of the best free things to do in Paris: it has views of the Opera House, Boulevard Haussmann and, across the slate-grey rooftops, the Eiffel Tower.\nGaleries Lafayatte\nLunch\nFor lunch, I\u2019m going to suggest another department store, one which neighbours Galeries Lafayette:\nAu Printemps\n.  Galeries Lafayette does have a canteen on the floor below the rooftop terrace, but neither the food nor the experience is very good, in my opinion.\nPrintemps has a couple of restaurants on the 8th floor of the menswear building with views and terrace access. I ate at\nLa Reine Mer\n, which specialises in fish and seafood. Next door, there\u2019s\nRegain\n, which has a meat-focused menu.\nWhichever you choose, do go out onto the terrace, which wraps around the building. I love how close it is to the ornate blue and gold domes and the views down Boulevard Haussmann.\nPrintemps view\nAfternoon\nMontmartre\nAfter lunch jump on the Metro to Anvers, to spend the afternoon in\nMontmartre\n.\nIt\u2019s a popular place and tends to have plenty of tourists almost year-round (unless you\u2019re in\nParis in winter\n). But there\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s so popular: it\u2019s really gorgeous! For that reason, I think it\u2019s worth a visit, even if it feels touristy in the most central areas.\nI suggest you stay here all afternoon, so you can take your time, stopping for drinks in cafes when you feel like it.\nSacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Montmartre\nTo help you explore the best of Montmartre, including some of the lesser-visited spots, I have created a free\nself-guided walking tour of Montmartre\n. This gives a manageable route that will take you to the main sights and prettiest streets, highlighting things to do along the way, plus places to eat.\nMontmartre highlights you\u2019ll discover on my walking tour include:\nBasilica of Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur\nde Montmartre, the most elegant church in Paris.\nPlace du Terte\n, the buzzing heart of Montmartre.\nLa Maison Rose\n, arguably the most instagrammable caf\u00e9 in Paris.\nRue de l\u2019Abreuvoir\n, one of the\nprettiest streets in Paris\n.\nVigne du Clos Montmartre\n\u2013 a vineyard in Paris!\nMus\u00e9e de Montmartre\n, a small museum in a historic building with lovely gardens \u2013 definitely worth a visit.\nMoulin de la Galette\n, the setting for a famous Renoir painting and home to one of the remaining Montmartre windmills (moulins).\nRue Lepic\n, which winds around Montmartre.\nLe Consulat\n\u2013 another cute, historic cafe.\nEscalier du Calvaire\n\u2013 one of the many stairways around the butte of Montmartre (exploring Montmartre can be strenuous!)\nThe Wall of Love\n, a modern monument to love.\nCimetiere de Montmartre\n, where impressionist painter Edgar Degas, writers Emile Zola and Alexandre Dumas and the film director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut are entombed.\nLe Passe-Muraille\nEscaliers du Calvaire\nRue de l\u2019Abreuvoir\nObviously, you could do a\nMontmartre guided tour\ninstead of my\nself-guided tour of Montmartre\n. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t take offence!\nDinner\nFor dinner, I recommend\nLa Boite aux Lettres\non Rue Lepic \u2013 this small and unpretentious bistro has an innovative menu with a focus on seasonal produce. If you can\u2019t get a table here,\nMoulin de la Galette\nhas pretty good traditional French food.\nThe menu at La Boite aux Lettres is seasonal. I ate fish with carrots three ways, which sounds like it would be awful \u2013 but it was delicious!\nAfter dinner, if you fancy it, consider catching a film at the retro Montmartre cinema,\nStudio 28 cinema\n. If you don\u2019t speak French, look for English language films marked \u2018VOST\u2019, which means they\u2019re in their original language, with subtitles in French.\nDay 4 \u2013 Grand Old Paris\nIf you\u2019ve followed this itinerary for 4 days in Paris, you will have seen a lot of Paris by now, but I\u2019ve saved some goodies for the last day, including a pretty special end to your trip.\nYou could walk between the spots I suggest for today, but many are connected by line 1 on the Metro, so you could jump on and off if your legs get tired!\nMorning\nYou might have heard of\nLe Marais\n, which was once an aristocratic district of Paris and where you\u2019ll find many buildings of historic and architectural importance. These days, it\u2019s a rather chic neighbourhood, where you might find boutiques, art galleries and cocktail bars.\nI\u2019m going to suggest a few spots to look out for, including one museum to visit, starting on the east side of the area and heading west.\nPlace des Vosges\nPlace Des Vosges\nis a grand square that was inaugurated in 1612 with a celebration of the engagement of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria.\nThe square itself has fountains, lawns, trees and a statue of Louis XIII on horseback in the middle. It was originally a place for the nobility to walk and socialise \u2013 to see and be seen. These days, it\u2019s a lovely spot to picnic or play\u00a0petanque.\nPlace des Vosges\nI think what makes it so attractive is the handsome buildings that surround it: all built to the same design, with red brick walls and blue slate rooves. Porticoes run all the way around, creating a cool sheltered walkway, where you\u2019ll find some restaurants and cafes, including Carette, which is known for its hot chocolate.\nMus\u00e9e Carnavalet\nMus\u00e9e Carnavalet\nis a really great museum for anyone interested in the history of Paris because its extensive collections chart the story of Paris from antiquity to this century.\nThey have ancient relics, sumptuous room sets from the 17th and 18th centuries and detailed documentation of the French Revolution and the various republics & empires. And\nCarnavalet Museum\nis free!\nMus\u00e9e Carnavalet\nI think it would be too much to try to see the entire exhibition, though. I have too much else in store for you today! So I suggest you pick a couple of areas you\u2019re interested in and spend around an hour here.\nRue des Rosiers\nRue des Rosiers\nis a charming narrow street in the heart of the Jewish Quarter and is a great place to get some low-cost but hearty falafel from one of the many vendors.\nH\u00f4tel de Ville\nH\u00f4tel de Ville\nis the City Hall of Paris and has been since 1357 (although the current building was rebuilt in the 19\nth\ncentury). The architectural style is that classic French Renaissance style, inspired by the Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley. It has those recognisable steeply sloped rooves, a spire and fancy chimneys.\nH\u00f4tel de Ville\nLunch\nFor lunch, I recommend\nLe Georges\n, a smart modern restaurant on the top of the\nPompidou Centre\n, with southward views of Paris. I really enjoyed some icy strawberry and tomato soup, followed by pasta here on one warm September day in Paris.\nAfternoon\nThe Louvre\nFor your final afternoon in Paris, I suggest the\nMus\u00e9e du Louvre\n, which you can get to by walking or grabbing the Metro from H\u00f4tel de Ville station to Palais-Royal \u2013 Mus\u00e9e du Louvre.\nA museum since 1793, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre is the world\u2019s most-visited museum and home to Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa. But it has so much more than that: the museum owns more than 600,000 objects over thousands of years of history and it can take hours to explore thoroughly.\nIt\u2019s best to\nreserve tickets in advance\n, and I\u2019ve heard the lines are much shorter if you go into the lower level, inside the pyramid. I haven\u2019t tested this myself, though \u2013 it\u2019s been a while since I went into the Louvre, although I visit the impressive grounds on most of my visits to Paris.\nThe main Renaissance buildings, which were once a royal palace, are suitably grand and stately; and the glass pyramid is such an innovative contrast.\nPassage de Richelieu\nJardin Des Tuileries And Beyond\nAfter the Louvre, or instead, if you don\u2019t fancy exploring it, carry on heading west towards your final stop the\nArc De Triomphe\n,\nwhich you want to reach an hour before sunset\n.\nTuileries Gardens\nIf you have time and energy, there are a few places of interest along the way, including:\nJardin des Tuileries\n\u2013 an extensive park with walkways, ponds and views of several iconic landmarks in Paris: the Louvre, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, the obelisk at Place de la Concord and, in the distance, the Eiffel Tower.\nMus\u00e9e De l\u2019Orangerie\nis a small art gallery primarily home to several of Monet\u2019s largest Water Lilies paintings. You can find it at the western end of Tuileries Gardens.\nPlace de Concorde\n\u2013 it has fancy street lamps and an Egyptian obelisk in the centre. But it\u2019s still very busy with cars and hard to admire if I\u2019m being honest\u2026\nPetit Palais\nis a lovely gallery \u2013 and another free one! You won\u2019t have time to explore it thoroughly, but I feel like the romantic Beaux-Arts-style architecture is even more impressive than the art. Check out the pretty interior courtyard.\nChamps-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\n\u2013 known for being the main shopping street in Paris, you might want to have a look at it before or after the Arc De Triomphe. It\u2019s not among the best places in Paris, though, in my opinion, but the view to the Arc De Triomphe is pretty cool.\nPetit Palais\nIf you prefer, or if you\u2019re running out of time, you could get the Metro instead of walking this stretch \u2013 line 1 goes from the Louvre to Charles de Gaulle-Etoile station in a few stops.\nArc De Triomphe\nThe reason I say you should get here an hour before sunset is your final stop is wonderful at sunset.\nThe final stop is the viewing platform on top of the\nArc De Triomphe\n, that impressive monument installed by Napoleon to honour those who died for France in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.\nArc De Triomphe\nIt\u2019s a great thing to do in Paris at any time, but it\u2019s extra special to see the sun go down over Paris, to watch the skies change and then to see the city lights come on. And of course, the best part is when the Eiffel Tower sparkles, which it does for 5 minutes every hour.\nSunset skies\nEiffel Tower sparkles\nSunset views from the\nArc De Triomphe roof terrace\nWhat a great way to end this itinerary for 4 days in Paris!\nDinner\nBut we\u2019re not finished: you still need to eat! The only restaurant I have been to near the Arc De Triomphe is a very fancy, very expensive fine dining restaurant in the\nHotel Peninsula\n:\nL\u2019Oiseau Blanc\n.\nIf you don\u2019t mind splashing some serious cash (I\u2019m not exaggerating, the prices made my jaw drop), this is a great way to spend your final evening in Paris. The meal I had here was\nexquisite.\nCanapes at L\u2019Oiseau Blanc\nIf your budget doesn\u2019t stretch that far, don\u2019t worry: there are plenty of more affordable places to eat in the lively\nBastille\narea (which means jumping back on the Metro first). these include\nCaf\u00e9 des Anges\nand\nLe Pure Caf\u00e9\n, which featured in the movie Before Sunset.\nMap: Itinerary For 4 Days In Paris\nHere is a map of all the wonderful things I recommend you do in this itinerary for 4 days in Paris, organised by day.

It\u2019s a big city with a rich history. Sometimes I re-do the same things; sometimes I discover new things. I feel like I\u2019ll always be able to find delight in Paris, no matter how much time I\u2019ve spent there.\nThat said, I don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s a\nminimum\nnumber of days, either. I have done several short trips when I spent only 1 or\n2 days in Paris\n. My philosophy is if you only have x days in Paris, better to have that number of days than no days in Paris.\nI created this itinerary for 4 days In Paris because 4 days is a\ngood\namount of time to experience the best of Paris. You can get a feel for the breadth of what the city has to offer. And it\u2019s not too much time that you\u2019ll tire of Paris if it isn\u2019t to your liking (this happens \u2013 some people think Paris is overrated and\nParis Syndrome\nis a real thing!).\nAnd ultimately, if you like what you see in those 4 days in Paris, you can always come back for more, like I do.\nI love exploring\noff-the-beaten-path Paris\nWhat Is The Best Time To Visit Paris?\nI\u2019ve been to Paris in every season and my favourites are Spring and Autumn (Fall). In both of these \u2018shoulder\u2019 seasons, you do have the risk of rain, but I think the benefits outweigh the downsides.\nSpring in Paris\nis glorious, especially in April and early May, when the city blooms: first flowers and cherry blossoms, then the trees burst into life with vibrant green leaves. This is the best season for exploring Paris\u2019s many outdoor attractions and gorgeous parks.\nAutumn in Paris\nis excellent too: in September and October, the weather can still be mild, making the city very walkable. And the leaves change to orange and red, so you see the city in a softer light.\nParis in winter\nis the quietest in terms of visitor numbers, and it can get pretty cold (definitely coats, scarves and gloves weather) \u2013 but I like this season too. In December, the Christmas festivities are really nice: there are pretty light displays and lots of cheerful\nParisian Christmas Markets\n. And January, whilst being dark and cold, is your best chance for exploring without the crowds \u2013 though you might find opening hours can be reduced.\nParis in Spring\nParis in Autumn\nParis in Winter\nSummer in Paris\nis my least favourite season, and I\u2019ve avoided it for years. It can be too hot to explore the city on foot. And in August, some businesses close as many Parisians take their holidays elsewhere.\nGetting To Paris\nIf you\u2019re travelling a long distance to Paris, you\u2019ll probably fly in.

I\u2019ve stayed in all of these places myself in the last couple of years, and I recommend them (I\u2019ve left out the places I stayed that I don\u2019t recommend!).\nLa Finca H\u00f4tel & Spa\n(previously the Hotel Auberge Flora) is in the\u00a0vibrant\nBastille\narea. It\u2019s a good 3-star option. The rooms are snug but comfortable and well-equipped. I liked the cheerful bar downstairs and they offer a simple breakfast in the morning. I didn\u2019t try the spa, though \u2013 I think they have added that since I stayed there.\nIn\u00a0charming\nMontmartre\n, the\nTerrass\u201d Hotel\nis an excellent 4-star hotel, which is close to the many attractions of Montmartre and also has wonderful views across Paris to the Eiffel Tower \u2013 from both its rooftop bar & restaurant and some rooms/suites.\nBreakfast at the\nTerrass\u201d Hotel\nH\u00f4tel Diva Op\u00e9ra\nis a centrally-located 4-star boutique hotel in\nFauberg-Montmartre\n. It\u2019s close to Boulevard Haussmann and the fancy department stores, like Galeries Lafayette, plus there are plenty of cafes in the vicinity, as well as several of the\nbest covered passages in Paris\n.\nIf you want to indulge a little on this trip to Paris, I can also recommend the 5-star\nHotel Regina Louvre\n, which is right next to the Louvre. The hotel is smart, luxurious and has great food. Some rooms have a view of the Eiffel Tower.\nHotel Regina Louvre\nFor more Paris hotel recommendations, read my post on the\nbest place to stay in Paris for first-timers\n.\nGetting Around Paris\nI think Paris is very walkable, but it\u2019s hard to see the best of Paris in 4 days without using the Metro at least a few times. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s pretty easy to use (and much cheaper than taking taxis everywhere).\nI use\nCityMapper\nto help me plan my routes across Paris \u2013 this clever, free app has all the public transport data in it and it will show you the best routes around the city, including walking, buses, trams, trains and the Metro. I prefer it to Googlemaps for getting around via public transport.\nParis Metro Tips\nWhen you use the Metro, remember to make a note of which line you need. And also\nnote the final destination\nfor that line \u2013 this will help you make sure you take the train that is going in the right direction because they don\u2019t use \u2018westbound\u2019 or \u2018uptown\u2019 or anything like that.\nAlso, make sure you\nkeep your ticket\nuntil you leave the metro. Even though you don\u2019t need the ticket to exit the station, if you were stopped during a random ticket check and couldn\u2019t produce the ticket you used to enter the metro, you would be charged a fine \u2013 and you don\u2019t want that!\nThe Last Word\nI hope this Paris itinerary has inspired you with ideas and a plan to experience the best of Paris in just four days.\nIf you\u2019re planning your first time in Paris, check out my guide to\nvisiting Paris for the first time\n, including tips on things you should know about Paris.\nAnd if you have a romantic trip in mind, get some ideas of\nthings to do in Paris for couples\n.\nFinally, if you want to get\noff the beaten path in Paris\n, I have plenty of ideas for that too.\nEnjoy Paris!\nIf you like this article, I'd be delighted if you shared it!\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAbout The Author\nMartha Knight\nI am an experience-seeker, a discovery addict and a dramatic landscape junkie.

It has given me great clarity to planning my first trip. I would be staying in the Saint Germain Des Pres area. How should I plan my route using Bato bus? I see from Google map that I am walking distance from the Batobus Station \u2013 Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. I can click the link from your page to get the tickets ahead of time or do I have to buy the ticket from from the station kiosk? Is the boarding point near the station?

It\u2019s a beautiful, well-adored, historically magnificent city. Out of all my travel destinations, I have to admit, Paris is probably one of my favorites. It just\nfeels\nlike an entirely different world. There are so many attractions to visit, so many monuments to awe over, such beautiful architecture, and so much fashion to delve into, you will never find yourself bored there.\nIn the last three years I\u2019ve been to Paris three times, because no matter how many times I go, I never tire of it. Beyond the iconic Eiffel Tower, Paris has been renowned since the 17th century for diplomacy, fashion, arts and sciences, and notably, its extensive street lighting system earning it the nickname \u201cCity of Lights.\u201d Pretty cool, huh?\nWith all the things to do in the city it can get overwhelming, especially if you\u2019re considering visiting the city for the first time. And while a weekend trip lets you experience the highlights, I recommend a week-long stay \u2013 you deserve it! I have the perfect 7-day Paris itinerary for you plus tips and trips on navigating the city and its museums.\nWhenever if travel, I like to plan various activities in the same general area so that time isn\u2019t lost going back and forth in a train or taxi. Paris is broken up into different districts called arrondissements, and this weeklong Paris itinerary focuses on different days in a handful of my favorite ones.\nParis Itinerary: Exploring The City\nin 7 Days\nDay 1\nIt\u2019s day 1 in Paris and I know you want to see it all. But, don\u2019t start worrying just yet. If you follow this itinerary, you\u2019ll be booked all week. No need to cram everything in on the first day!\nThat being said, after landing at\nCharles de Gaulle\nairport, getting through customs, taking the RER B train or taxi to the city, and checking into your destination, you\u2019ll likely find yourself exhausted. I always like to plan a lowkey, relaxing activity. If you\u2019re staying at a hotel in Paris, they often offer to store your luggage for you even if your room isn\u2019t ready, so you can go ahead and start exploring!\nTake a Seine River Cruise\nOther than dinner at a close by caf\u00e9, one of the most relaxing activities that I can think of for your first day in Paris is a cruise on the Seine River. Assuming jet lag isn\u2019t getting the best of you, this is a beautiful way to start your Paris trip since you\u2019ll begin your trip by seeing Paris\u2019s most famous monuments.\nEnjoy views of the Eiffel Tower, pass by museums like the Louvre and Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, then get a glimpse of Il de Cite with Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle. Paris has 37 bridges, several of which you\u2019ll get to see up close, that you can only view via boat.\nThere are a variety of options for a boat cruise on the Seine River, from a basic hour tour to more elevated options with snacks, champagne, and even dinner.\nI recommend\nVedettes de Paris\nif you\u2019re staying near the Arc de Triomphe, Trocadero area or Eiffel Tower and\nVedettes du Pont Neuf\nif you\u2019re staying in Saint Germain, the Latin Quarter, near the Louvre, or in Le Marais. Both offer one-hour guided tours in French and English.\nNo matter which boat company you choose, all bateaux mouches follow the same path, offering the same sightseeing experience.\nI like to take a boat cruise in the evening before or after dinner, but this will of course depend on your arrival time in Paris.\nSpend the rest of your first day walking around winding local streets near your hotel or apartment; they\u2019re part of what makes Paris so charming, and it\u2019s the best way to get acquainted with your neighborhood.\nDay 2 \u2013 1\nst\nArrondissement\nIt\u2019s your first morning in Paris, and you\u2019re probably still trying to pinch yourself awake from the dreamthat is this city. Whenever I travel somewhere new, I like to cross of the heavy hitters and must-see things at the start of my trip. In Paris, this means classic landmarks and iconic museums.\nGrab a pair of comfortable sneakers (everyone in Paris was wearing\nthese\nor\nthese\nwhen I visited last) and get ready for a sightseeing day!\nTour the Louvre\nWhether you\u2019re an art lover or not,\nthe Louvre\nis one the most iconic museums to exist. It\u2019s the world\u2019s largest museum and houses some of the most famous masterpieces ever created. Here, you\u2019ll find the Mona Lisa, The Winged Victory of Samothrace, and Venus de Milo.\nYou won\u2019t grasp how extraordinary this experience is until you try it yourself, and it\u2019s extremely overwhelming, even if you\u2019ve visited before.\nAlthough you can use a map or purchase an interactive one with self-guided tours, I found the device to be unreliable with spotty geo-locating, which is needed for it to be effective.\nPlanning a Trip to Paris?\nGet my curated guide to the City of Lights, with over 50 pages and 100+ recommendations, plus travel tips, basic etiquette, an interactive map, and more!\nbuy the guide\nInstead, I\u2019d highly recommend one of several guided tours through the museum. You can book these directly through the Louvre website or\nhere\n. A guided walking tour through the Louvre is a great way to see the museum\u2019s most famous works with informative commentary in 2 hours. Plus, you can always stay later if there are any part of the museum you still want to discover. I personally love the Napoleon III Apartments wing!\nAfter your visit, you\u2019ll definitely need a snack or lunch. There are several food kiosks in Jardin des Tuileries (Tuileries Garden) just across the street. Then, make your way to\nMusee de L\u2019Orangerie\nto continue your museum day.\nSee Claude Monet\u2019s Water Lilies\nLocated on the far west side of the Jardin des Tuileries (Tuileries Garden) is\nMusee de L\u2019Orangerie\n. It\u2019s a serene, all white interior museum that houses Claude Monet\u2019s enormous water lilies paintings.\nStop By Place de la Concorde\nJust a short walk from this museum is Place de la Concorde, a site full of significant history. In its early days, it was an execution spot during the French Revolution, tallying up to 1,119 people guillotined just in this square alone, including Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. That quickly changed, when less than 100 years later, Jacques-Ignace Hittorf changed the square into what exists today. Now sits the Luxor Obelisk, an Egyptian monument placed in 1836, reputable hotels, and two monumental fountains.\nYou don\u2019t need to spend a ton of time here, but you can see the Obelisk up close and stare straight down Avenue de Champs Elysees for a view of the Arc de Triomphe.\nDay 3 \u2013 Take a Day Trip\nVisit Versailles\nFor your third day, get away from Paris\u2019 city center and take a fun day trip! Day trips are the best way to still enjoy what the city has to offer while giving yourself a break from trying to take it all in.\nVersailles\nis a wonderful day trip if it\u2019s your first time in Paris. I know some people find it overrated, but the lawns themselves are stunning, and it\u2019s a huge part of France\u2019s history, dating all the way back to the 1600s. You\u2019ll want to get there are early in the morning as possible because it does get very crowded.\nI went there years ago when I was in high school and I still vividly remember the sprawling lawn enormous gardens, and famous Hall of Mirrors.\nIt\u2019s worth paying for\na guided tour of the palace and gardens\n; learn about the lavish life of kings and queens, a typical day in the life of Marie Antoinette, and explore the green space that was once the setting for\u00a0elaborate balls and parties.\nOther day trips from Paris include Disneyland Paris (40 minutes),\nReims for Champagne tasting\n(45 minutes), and if you\u2019re an art lover, Giverny to visit Claude Monet\u2019s home and garden (60 minutes).\nDay 4 \u2013 4\nth\n, 5\nth\nand 6\nth\nArrondissements\nI stayed a full month in Paris right on the edge of the 5\nth\nand 6\nth\narrondissements, so I\u2019m biased when I say these neighborhoods on the Left Bank are my favorite. Even though there are plenty of tourists, this area somehow feels a little more local than other touristy parts of the city.\nSee Notre Dame Cathederal\nStart your day visiting Il de la Cite, a little island that is where the history of Paris begins.\nThe most famous landmark here is of course Notre Dame. Admire its beautiful gothic architecture and rose windows from the outside, and be sure to take a walk through the cathedral now that it\u2019s restored after the 2019 fire.\nVisit Sainte Chapelle and La Conciergerie\nA couple blocks over you\u2019ll find\nSainte Chapelle\n, another church on the island with the most impressive display of  impressive of stained-glass windows I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s truly breathtaking.\nJust next door you\u2019ll find\nLa Conciergerie\n, which at various points in time was a royal palace, courthouse, and prison.\nWalk Ile Saint Louis\nFrom here, you can stroll east on Ile de la Cite to another small island, Ile Saint Louis.\nYou\u2019ll notice several cafes all serving local\nBerthillon\nice cream. Sit down and enjoy a scoop, or find even more flavors at the original Berthillon ice cream shop and tea room, also located on the island.\nIle Saint Louis is always quiet and peaceful, and it\u2019s a great little escape in the middle of Paris.\nHead to the Latin Quarter\nAfter your ice cream, head south and over the river into the Left Bank. You\u2019re now entering the Latin Quarter, or 5\nth\narrondissement.\nBecause the Latin Quarter is one of the oldest parts of the city, you\u2019ll feel like you stepped back in time into what Paris was in the very beginning. It began and remained a central hub for learning and education, housing many universities within its borders. Here\u2019s a quick run-through of everything you\u2019ll get to see while walking through:\nSaint-Michel Fountain\nSorbonne University\nShakespeare & Co\nThe Pantheon\nYou can easily walk to any or all of these. After you\u2019re done, stop by a boulangerie to pick up a sandwich, and head to Jardin du Luxembourg.\nEnjoy Jardin du Luxembourg\nKnown for its lush lawns, tree-lined paths, and of course the famous green lawn chairs, it\u2019s easy to see why so many people love Jardin du Luxembourg.\nTake a seat in a chair, eat your sandwich, and enjoy people watching while you rest your feet for a bit. In warmer months you\u2019ll find dozens of children running around the large fountain, chasing around their sailboats in the water. You\u2019ll also find the beautiful Medici Fountain here, which looks like it was plucked right out for a fairytale.\nEnd Your Day in Saint Germain\nSaint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (the 6\nth\narrondissement), seated right on the left bank, was originally known for the artists, writers, and painters. Now, it\u2019s become known for its bustling and lively vibe full of cafes, galleries, markets, and true heritage. There are plenty of places to visit and this place is truly a little village of its own.\nBe sure to stop by one of the cafes; they are plentiful here. Don\u2019t miss Caf\u00e9 de Flore or Les Deux Magots; both are Instagram-worthy, but the people are nicer at Les Deux Magot (as is the food).\nOnce you\u2019re done exploring, end your night with rooftop drinks with panoramic views of Paris at H\u00f4tel Dame des Arts at 4 Rue Danton. Be sure to make advance reservations\nhere\n.\nDay 5 \u2013 Montmartre & Other Arrondissements\nMontmartre and Sacre Coeur\nThe neighborhood of Montmartre feels very different from the rest of Paris. With steep winding roads and a bohemian feel, it\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re not even in the same city. But it\u2019s definitely worth a trip here. Perched at the top of the hill you\u2019ll find\nSacre Coeur Basilica\n. Even if you\u2019re not religious you should go in; it\u2019s really pretty (and you\u2019re already there so you may as well). The steps of this church provide a bird\u2019s eye view of Paris and it\u2019s beautiful.\nAfter, take a short walk down a winding road to Place du Tertre, the famous square where you can find dozens of painters and portrait artists, cafes, and small tourist shops.\nTake some time to get lost in the little side streets, then make your way over to\nTerrass Hotel\nfor a fabulous rooftop lunch or drinks.\nMoulin Rouge is about a five-minute walk from here, but keep in mind that its immediate surrounding areas are vastly different from where you\u2019re coming from since it\u2019s located in the former red-light district. If you really want to see it, great, but there\u2019s not much to it and I don\u2019t love the area.\nGrab a taxi and make your way to the Arc de Triomphe.\nTake in Rooftop Views at Arc de Triomphe\nArc de Triomphe is one of my favorite Paris landmarks. Climb up 330 stairs to the top (there\u2019s an elevator for those who need it) for views of the Eiffel Tower as well as the buildings and streets. Although the view is especially incredible at nighttime, it\u2019s breathtaking no matter the time you take the trek.\nYou can then take the metro to Trocadero, a massive open area with another A+ view of the Eiffel Tower. It\u2019s always busy, but once you\u2019re there you can see why.\nAlternatively, make dinner reservations for\nGirafe\n. It\u2019s an upscale restaurant with the same view and great food. If you time things correctly and have dinner late enough at night, you\u2019ll also be able to see the Eiffel Tower light up and sparkle. It sparkles at the top of every hour after dusk hits.\nPlanning a Trip to Paris?\nGet my curated guide to the City of Lights, with over 50 pages and 100+ recommendations, plus travel tips, basic etiquette, an interactive map, and more!\nbuy the guide\nDay 6 \u2013 Shopping\nShopping\nDay 6 will be your last big activity day, because you\u2019ll need all the rest you can get before heading back home.\nI\u2019d be remiss to skip out on mentioning shopping in Paris! Shopping in Paris is always a good idea. For starters, most French brands are cheaper there than in the US because there\u2019s no exporting. This means decent savings on French fashion brands like\nSezane\n,\nFrench pharmacy beauty\n, and especially designer purchases \u2013 even when converting from euros to dollars.\nBut you can also take advantage of VAT refunds. VAT (value added tax) is included in all prices in the European Union, and you\u2019re able to qualify to get that refunded so long as your purchase is over 100 euros and you let the sales associate know before you purchase, so they can provide you with the right forms. (When you leave Paris, scan these are the passport and within a few weeks you\u2019ll receive the VAT amount back onto your card.) This is usually around 12%.\nRue Saint-Honor\u00e9 and the surrounding streets are famous for luxury shopping, and you can find everything there from Dior and Louis Vuitton to Hermes and Chanel.\nThere are also several amazing department stores in Paris: Le Bon Marche, Samaritaine, and BHV.\nWalk Around Le Marais\nYou can also find small boutiques and vintage stores in Le Marais, so head there in the afternoon after you\u2019ve dropped off any designer purchases safely at your hotel.\nOnce you\u2019re in the area, be sure to visit La Place des Vosges. It\u2019s the oldest square in Paris. It\u2019s small, but it\u2019s pretty.\nFind a nice brasserie or caf\u00e9 for dinner.\nWhere To Stay In Paris\nParis is a large city, and each arrondisssement, or district, has a different vibe. There\u2019s truly a place for everyone here but is also makes choosing an area overwhelming.\nThe 6th Arrondissement\nThis is where I have stayed the most during my trips to Paris, so it\u2019s where I have the most recommendations. The 6\nth\narrondissement, otherwise known as Saint Germain, is one of my favorite neighborhoods. It boasts tons of cafes, great shopping, and easy access to both the Seine and Jardin du Luxembourg. I prefer to stay here because it feels a bit more local than areas like Champs Elysees or near the Louvre but is still centrally located.\nA few fabulous hotels in this area include:\nHotel d\u2019Aubusson\nHotel Relais Christine\nLe Relais Saint Germain\nHotel Dame des Artes\nOther Hotels in Paris\nLa Fantaisie\n(9\nth\narrondissement)\n\u2013 beautiful courtyard garden, vibrant interiors, and restaurant by Michelin-starred chef Dominique Crenn. The rooftop bar and spa are highly recommended.\nGrands Boulevards Experime\nntal\n(between 2\nnd\nand 9\nth\narrondissements)\n\u2013 glass-covered courtyard dining area, and if you\u2019re into cocktails, this is the place to be\nTerrass Hotel\n(18\nth\narrondissement/Montmartre)\n\u2013 quiet, village vibes but super close to Sacre Coeur and Moulin Rouge. Great rooftop bar with panoramic views and romantic feels, plus also a Nuxe Spa there in case you want to add in a day of pampering.\nLuxury Hotels in Paris\nPlaza Athenee\nThe Ritz\nHotel Lutetia\nCheval Blanc\nAre you excited to go to Paris yet?\nParis is a beautiful city to visit, and there\u2019s so much to do there. I hope this 7-day Paris itinerary helps you plan your perfect trip there! If you use this guide in any way or visit any of the locations I shared, let me know!

I have been postponing the creation of this blog article for years now. The reason is pretty simple, I\u2019m way too emotionally attached to this city and there is so much I want to say that it is hard to even know where to start. I\u2019ve lived in the city of lights for about 5 years, but have been visiting since I was born (half of my family is from there). Over the years, I\u2019ve had multiple friends visiting, and I was always on a mission to show them the best of the city!\nUnfortunately, Paris isn\u2019t exactly known for its welcoming approach and a lot of visitors end up not enjoying their time in this beautiful city. I\u2019m here to help change that, and I\u2019m proud to say that every single person who\u2019s visited me during my time there has had an amazing time!\nIn this blog article, I share my 5-day Parisian itinerary for first-timers. Most days are packed with activities and sightseeing, so feel free to mix things around or spread those activities over a longer period if you can afford to do that! It\u2019s also worth noting that Paris is a city that needs to be seen on foot \u2013 meaning there will be a lot of walking involved. Don\u2019t worry, you can also rely on public transport to do the same itinerary, but in my opinion, the most beautiful things to see in Paris are its streets and its buildings.\nParis\nThe itinerary that\u2019ll make you fall in love\nwith the City of Lights\nShop this print\nDay 1: From Montmartre to the Opera\nHighlights\n\u2023 Montmartre & Sacr\u00e9-Coeur\n\u2023 Pigalle\n\u2023 Moulin Rouge\n\u2023 Galeries Lafayette\n\u2023 Op\u00e9ra Garnier\nStart your day early, catching the sunrise in\nMontmartre\nbefore the crowds roll in. Hop off at Anvers station and take your time ascending the steps, passing by a charming carousel. Once Sacr\u00e9-Coeur opens, make sure to explore this beautiful church, with a special recommendation for the dome climb \u2013 my personal favourite.\nWander through Montmartre's iconic spots like La Maison Rose, Le Consulat, and Le Moulin de la Galette. Grab a coffee or breakfast at The Hardware Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, a lovely Australian caf\u00e9. Head down to Abbesses via Rue Lepic, stopping to check out the Wall of Love.\nTake a quick detour to Moulin Rouge; you can always revisit at night to see the neighbourhood lit up. For lunch, consider Bouillon Pigalle for traditional French fare or Pink Mamma for its iconic decor and delicious truffle pasta.\nAfter lunch, explore Galeries Lafayette, admiring the dome and enjoying panoramic views from the rooftop. Even if shopping isn't your thing, the architecture and views are worth a visit. If you\u2019re visiting during the Christmas period, make sure to check out their famous\nLafayette Christmas Tree\n.\nEnd your day at the Opera Garnier, known for its stunning facade and mesmerizing interiors. Plan ahead for a guided tour to learn about its history - the Opera Garnier has witnessed over a century of artistic performances and holds architectural significance as a masterpiece by Charles Garnier.\nIf you're feeling a bit peckish, a coffee break at Caf\u00e9 de la Paix is a good idea. Then head back to your hotel, get changed for dinner, and find my dinner recommendations at the end of this article.\nDISCOVER MY PARIS PRINT COLLECTION\nShop here\nDay 2: Parisian Icons\nHighlights\n\u2023 Eiffel Tower, Trocad\u00e9ro & Champ-de-Mars\n\u2023 Champs Elys\u00e9es\n\u2023 Arc-de-Triomphe\n\u2023 Place de la Concorde\n\u2023 Alexandre III Bridge\n\u2023 Louvre Museum & Louvre Pyramid\nToday is all about exploring Paris' most famous landmarks. If you're an early bird like me, head to the Eiffel Tower at sunrise. Get off at Trocad\u00e9ro metro station for a serene experience at Place du Trocad\u00e9ro before the crowds arrive. Slowly make your way down the stairs towards the Champ-de-Mars to get closer to the Eiffel Tower. There\u2019s a really nice photo opportunity\nhere\nfor those of you who like photography.\nYou might get hungry very quickly if you visit early in the morning, and I urge you to follow this piece of advice: do not, I repeat\ndo not\nhead to the first few restaurants you see near Paris\u2019 most famous monuments. The food will be average, the service horrible and the prices astronomical.\nInstead, opt for French toast at Ladur\u00e9e on Les Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es; make sure to grab a box of their famous macarons before you leave. Move on to the Arc-de-Triomphe; while most people stop\nhere\nfor a photo, know that there are 11 other less crowded avenues around the Place Charles-de-Gaulle. The tunnel to go underneath Place Charles-de-Gaulle and get to the Arc-de-Triomphe is located\nhere\n. Once you\u2019ve crossed to the middle of this place, you\u2019ll be able to climb to the top of it!\nResist the shopping temptations on Les Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es (it\u2019s full of scammers and pickpockets) and head to Place de la Concorde. Then, head right and cross the Alexandre III Bridge, a beautiful piece of architecture, adorned with exquisite sculptures and offering a splendid view of the Seine River. People love to gather around here during the warm summer months to enjoy a drink!\nExplore the Tuileries garden and head to the Louvre Pyramid. Grab a coffee or drinks at Caf\u00e9 Marly or simply snap some photos from Passage de Richelieu. Art enthusiasts can consider visiting both Le Louvre and Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, though you might be museum-fatigued by this point. The Louvre, once a royal palace, now houses an extensive collection, including the Mona Lisa. Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, a former railway station, boasts Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces. No matter which one you choose to visit, make sure to make a booking ahead of time to avoid any disappointments.\nIf you have time, you should definitely check out the Palais Royal near Le Louvre; its intriguing cylinder installations provide a picturesque backdrop for photos.\nNote for those who love museums: There are other nice museums in the area including Le Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, which usually hosts fashion exhibitions, and the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie which focuses on European 20th-century art. Other Parisian museums I really like are: the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne, the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, the Mus\u00e9e Jacquemart-Andr\u00e9, the Petit Palais, the Centre George Pompidou and the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly.\nDISCOVER MY PARIS PRINT COLLECTION\nSHOP HERE\nDay 3: Latin Quarter & The East\nHighlights\n\u2023 Le Marais\n\u2023 Hotel de Ville\n\u2023 Place des Vosges\n\u2023 Notre-Dame-de-Paris\n\u2023 Quartier Latin / St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s\n\u2023 Jardin du Luxembourg\nBegin your day with the colourful Rue Cr\u00e9mieux in the 12th arrondissement. Keep it low-key and respectful of residents\u2019 privacy during your early morning visit. Walk along Canal St-Martin to Place des Vosges, a beautiful square, especially during autumn, with a rich history dating back to the 17th century.\nIn Le Marais, enjoy breakfast at one of Rue Des Archives' charming cafes. Head to L\u2019H\u00f4tel de Ville and then L\u2019Ile de la Cit\u00e9 to see Notre-Dame-de-Paris, even if it's still closed for renovations at the time of your visit. Explore the streets around the cathedral, you\u2019ll surely stumble upon Au Vieux Paris d'Arcole, one of Paris\u2019 oldest restaurants. Notre-Dame, a masterpiece of French Gothic architecture, witnessed centuries of history, from royal events to Victor Hugo's literary masterpiece \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.\"\nDon't overlook Sainte-Chapelle; it's worth a visit for its breathtaking interiors, showcasing stunning stained glass windows.\nMove on to St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s and take in the charm of the Latin Quarter. Consider lunch or a coffee at iconic cafes like Cafe de Flore or Cafe des Deux Magots, both frequented by famous writers and intellectuals.\nExplore \u00c9glise St-Germain, rue de Buci, and \u00c9glise St-Sulpice. Rue de Renne offers a less crowded shopping experience, and Le Bon March\u00e9 is a tranquil department store nearby. H\u00f4tel Lutetia is also located nearby and displays stunning Parisian architecture.\nEnd your day with a leisurely stroll or a picnic at the peaceful Jardin du Luxembourg, a perfect way to wrap up your exploration. The garden, commissioned by Queen Marie de Medici in the 17th century, reflects the elegance of French classical style.\nDISCOVER MY PARIS PRINT COLLECTION\nSHOP HERE\nDay 4: Day Trip to Versailles\nHighlights\n\u2023 Palace of Versailles\n\u2023 Grand Trianon\n\u2023 Queen\u2019s Hamlet\nTake a day to explore the Palace of Versailles, a one-hour journey from Paris accessible by car or RER C. This UNESCO World Heritage site, commissioned by Louis XIV in the 17th century, reflects the grandeur of France's monarchy across 2,000 acres of stunning grounds.\nBegin your tour in the Palace's Hall of Mirrors, a dazzling hall adorned with 357 mirrors, symbolising the wealth and power of the French monarchy and where the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919. Admire the opulent Royal Apartments, including the iconic Queen's Bedroom and King's Bedroom, showcasing the extravagant taste of the monarchs.\nExplore the Petit Trianon, a retreat for Marie Antoinette, and its Queen's Hamlet, offering a glimpse into royal rustic life. The Grand Trianon, another royal retreat, boasts a pink marble facade and elegant gardens.\nVisit the Orangery, housing citrus trees in winter, and the charming Temple of Love in the Estate of Trianon. Conclude your day with a stroll through the manicured gardens, adorned with fountains and statues. The musical gardens and fountain shows on selected days transport you to the era of Louis XIV.\nThis day trip provides a condensed yet immersive journey into the extravagant lifestyle and rich history of the French monarchy.\nImportant:\nalways check opening hours ahead of time to avoid any surprise when you get there. The Palace is usually closed on Mondays. I\u2019d also strongly recommend booking your tickets ahead of time.\nWhen you\u2019re back in Paris, go get changed at your hotel and head out to dinner.

Today, it offers a serene escape with lakes, gardens, and walking trails. The Parc de Bagatelle within Bois de Boulogne is particularly noteworthy for its charming rose garden and the Bagatelle Ch\u00e2teau.\nMove on to the Fondation Louis Vuitton, an architectural masterpiece designed by Frank Gehry. This contemporary art museum hosts rotating exhibitions, showcasing works from various artists. The building itself is a work of art, characterized by its futuristic design and innovative use of glass.\nFor a peaceful lunch in nature, head to the Auberge du Bonheur. If you\u2019re more of a city person, then head to Brasserie d\u2019Auteuil instead.\nIn the afternoon, slowly make your way back into the city. Bir Hakeim Bridge is a really great spot for a photo op and some more amazing views of the Eiffel Tower.\nThen, take a leisurely cruise along the Seine River with the Bateaux-Mouches. These boat tours provide a unique perspective of Paris, allowing you to glide past iconic landmarks while enjoying informative commentary. Witness the city's beauty from a different angle as you relax on the boat.\nAs night falls, revisit the vibrant neighbourhood of Pigalle to experience the Moulin Rouge in all its illuminated glory.

I thought I\u2019d summarise them here to help clarify how Paris is like.\nWhere to stay in Paris?\nThis depends on the type of vibe you\u2019re looking for. Some of my favourite neighbourhoods I would recommend staying in are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 9th & 18th arrondissements. I\u2019d suggest pinning all the locations you want to visit on a map and choosing a nice hotel or Airbnb that\u2019s closest to all the main attractions you want to visit.\nAvoid staying in all of the northern areas and the outskirts of the city. These areas can be dodgy, especially at night. I\u2019d also recommend staying away from Les Champs Elys\u00e9es at night.\nHow to get around Paris?\nBy foot, metro and Uber. If you\u2019re brave enough (I\u2019m not), you might also want to try the electric scooters. The Parisian metro, despite being very old and smelly at times, is super convenient and takes you to places in no time. I\u2019d suggest buying tickets by groups of 10 - if this option is still available at the ticket machines. Visit the RAPT website for the latest fares and routes.\nImportant:\ntake care of your belongings when using public transportation. Do not hold your phones near the doors, and make sure your pockets are empty and bags are closed. There are pickpockets everywhere.\nIs Paris a safe city to visit?\nThe answer to this question depends. I find Paris relatively safe, but it is worth noting that there are a lot of scammers and pickpockets. It\u2019s also not particularly fun as a solo woman traveller because there is still a lot of catcalling happening; don\u2019t walk alone at night in creepy alleys. Try to be street-smart and not attract attention too much. Avoid wearing expensive things and don\u2019t believe random strangers who might come and talk to you on the street; chances are another person is robbing you from the back.\nAre there days when things are closed in Paris?\nYes! I have found this to be one of the most frustrating things in France. Always check the opening hours of the places you want to visit, especially landmarks, castles, churches and museums. This also applies to restaurants. A lot of places are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays so it\u2019s worth doing your research beforehand.\nWhat typical French food should I try whilst in Paris?\nWhen in Paris, you\u2019ll have multiple options of French food to choose from. Some classics include beef tartare, steak frites, charcuterie & cheese boards, onion soup, duck confit, croque-monsieur/madame, cassoulet, boeuf bourguignon and foie gras. If you\u2019re into trying less common dishes, you might wanna try escargots (snails), cuisses de grenouille (frog legs) or andouillette (pork\u2019s intestines sausage).\nRelated Articles\nChristmas in paris\nFind out where where the best photos spots are during the Holiday Season.\nRead more\nEiffel Tower\nFind out my favourite photo spots to capture the beauty of the Iron Lady.\nRead more\nEurope\nGenevi\u00e8ve C.\n28 October 2023\nParis\nparis\n,\nfrance\n,\neiffel tower\n,\nparis itinerary\n,\nmoulin rouge\n,\narc de triomphe\nComment\nFacebook\n0\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n0\nReddit\nTumblr\nPinterest\n0\n0\nLikes"}]}

Could I conquer Paris in a weekend? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I thought. And that\u2019s exactly what I tried to do.\nMy roommate and I didn\u2019t have classes on Fridays, so she and I decided to book our flight for an upcoming Thursday night. That would give us all of Friday and Saturday to explore Paris before flying back to\nGranada, Spain\n, on Sunday.\nTwo days would be plenty of time, we assured ourselves as we scrambled to book hostel accommodations and research our destination to find things to do in Paris that weekend. With a $250 budget and a hilariously poor command of the French language, I was certain I had everything I needed to see the best of Paris in just 48 hours.\nParis Itinerary: Day 1\nAfter a few flight delays, my roommate and I arrived in Paris late on Thursday night. Although we were excited to be there, our exhaustion got the best of us. Within our first few minutes in The City of Lights, we were already struggling to navigate the Paris Metro.\nAfter a close call with a pickpocket and a few desperate\nsearches for English-speakers\n, we made it to our hostel just minutes before the 1 a.m. curfew. I\u2019m lucky my roommate set her alarm for 6:30 the next morning, or we would have slept through our entire first day in Paris.\n7 a.m. \u2014 Caf\u00e9 breakfast\nAlthough breakfast was provided at our hostel, my roommate and I wanted to take advantage of our proximity to the historic Montmartre neighborhood. We followed our noses to a nearby caf\u00e9, where we ordered a croissant and a pan au lait each, with a bowl of fresh fruit and two coffees on the side.\n8 a.m. \u2014 Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Basilica\nSince we were already in Montmartre, we decided to pay a quick visit to the gorgeous\nSacr\u00e9-Coeur Basilica\n. We took in the views from the top of the stairs and spent a blissful hour enjoying the tranquility of Paris in February.\nFast Fact: The basilica\u2019s dome is open every day. There is no elevator, so you\u2019ll need to climb the 280 steps up a narrow staircase to get to the top.\n10 a.m. \u2014 Walking tour\nFollowing another confusing mishap in the Paris Metro, we managed to find our way to the fountain at\nPlace Saint-Michel\n. Here, we caught a free walking tour of the city. I\u2019m a huge fan of\nSANDEMANs\nfree walking tours. Not only are they informative, but they tend to attract a diverse group of students, families, and other thrifty travelers.\nThe tour was essentially a two-and-a-half-hour crash course in Parisian history, culture, and architecture, and I came away from it with a newfound appreciation for one of the world\u2019s favorite cities.\nFast Fact: At Place Saint-Michel, you\u2019re close to the world-famous university, la Sorbonne. With all those students nearby, you\u2019ll find ample used bookstores and affordable bistros and caf\u00e9s.\n1 p.m. \u2014 The Eiffel Tower\nAfter a quick pit stop for sandwiches, we managed to find our way to Paris\u2019s crown jewel: the Eiffel Tower. Neither my roommate nor I had the budget or the time to go to the top of the tower, but we enjoyed taking touristy pictures in the nearby park.\nFast Fact: The price of Eiffel Tower tickets ranges from about 12\u20ac to 30\u20ac for adults depending on which level you want to go to and whether you choose to take the elevator or stairs. There are discounted rates for children, youth (for ticketing purposes, you\u2019re \u201cyoung\u201d until age 24), and\ntravelers with disabilities\n.\n2:30 p.m. \u2014 The Louvre\nAlthough I love art, the\nLouvre\nwas, tragically, too pricey and too time-consuming for our weekend in Paris. That said, my roommate and I were able to admire the glass pyramids outside the visitor center while we indulged in some fresh chocolate-banana crepes.\nFast Fact: If you have some extra time and the weather is nice, include the Tuileries Garden and Carrousel Garden in your tour. Both are part of the Louvre Estate. As a bonus, the Tuileries Garden is free to visit.\n4 p.m. \u2014 Paris Catacombs\nThe\nParis Catacombs\nweren\u2019t as iconic as other landmarks in the city, but they were one of our more interesting stops. The Catacombs took us beneath the city, where we walked among the bones of nearly six million Parisians.\nWhile it may sound gruesome, the Catacombs were a necessary measure in the 1700s, when city cemeteries were at capacity. Today, the bones are arranged to create a spectacular mausoleum that honors centuries of Parisians who were laid to rest.\nFast Fact: Seven Corners picked the maze-like Paris Catacombs as one of the\nspookiest destinations in the world\n. It\u2019s well worth the one-hour tour, even when you\u2019re only in Paris for a short time.\n6 p.m. \u2014 A fancy French dinner\nWhenever I travel, I try to sample as much of the local cuisine as I can, and my trip to Paris was no exception. After an exhausting day, my roommate and I enjoyed a relaxing dinner at\nLa Vache et Le Cuisinier\n.\nWas a fancy French bistro a bit outside of our price range? Perhaps. Was it worth every penny? Absolutely.\n8:30 p.m. \u2014 Seine River cruise\nTo end our night in style, we took an hour-long cruise down the Seine River. Unlike our earlier walking tour, we were able to sit back and take in the beauty of the city, all while enjoying a glass of wine.\nFrom the water, the bustling city seemed deceptively calm. And when the Eiffel Tower\u2019s lights began to shimmer to mark the top of the hour, my roommate and I agreed that the tour was the perfect end to a busy day.\nFast Fact: Paris undertook the major project of cleaning up the Seine ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, preparing for its use in the opening ceremonies and swimming events.\nParis Itinerary: Day 2\nThe next day began with another early morning. We were on our way to Versailles! After nearly boarding the wrong train and fumbling our way through the directions from a well-meaning security guard, we found an older British couple who was able to point us in the right direction. Just because we were young, independent travelers didn\u2019t mean we were too proud to ask for help.\n8:30 a.m. \u2014 The Palace of Versailles\nAlthough it involved a 45-minute train ride away from the city, our trip to the\nPalace of Versailles\nwas time well-spent. My roommate and I spent hours wandering the halls, totally mesmerized by the gorgeous architecture and extravagant art that surrounded us.\nWhat\u2019s more, the chilly February weather meant that the lines were short and crowds were thin.\nFast Fact: Because of the short days and increased chance of rain, February is considered travel\u2019s off season in Paris. That makes visits to iconic sites like Versailles less crowded, perfect for a quick visit if you can tolerate the weather.\n12:30 p.m. \u2014 Fancy French lunch\nBefore leaving Versailles, we treated ourselves to a hearty lunch in town. In addition to my soup, I may have ordered an entire baked brie appetizer for myself \u2014 because, you know, we were in\nFrance\n. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that the cheese may have been the best decision I made during the entire trip.\nFast Fact: When you\u2019re traveling in France on a budget, take advantage of the specials and smaller portions you\u2019ll find during lunchtime at nicer restaurant. It\u2019ll be cheaper than the dinner service.\n2:30 p.m. \u2014 Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris\nOnce we made our way back to the city, we stopped by the\nNotre Dame Cathedral\n. I was a huge fan of Disney\u2019s Hunchback of Notre Dame as a kid, so visiting the cathedral in person was nothing short of awe-inspiring. I especially appreciated seeing different groups of nuns, priests, and parishioners marveling alongside me.\nFast Fact: The cathedral closed after a devastating fire in 2019. It\u2019s expected to reopen in December 2024, followed by six months of celebrations.\n3:30 p.m. \u2014 Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and Arc De Triomph\nAlthough our energy was flagging, we decided to spend the rest of the afternoon window-shopping along the\nChamps-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\n. The famous avenue houses enormous retailers familiar at home, like H&M, Sephora, and Gap, along with luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Lacoste.\nOnce we made our way to the end of the street, we took pictures beneath the\nArc de Triomphe\n, an iconic landmark originally commissioned by Emperor Napoleon himself.\nFast Fact: The Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es is the site of a countless events throughout the year, from film festivals to the finish line of the Tour de France\u2019s final stage to the Bastille Day parade. This makes the already-crowded avenue even busier, but also certainly an unforgettable experience.\n6:30 p.m. \u2014 Indian food\nAlthough our decision to get Indian food was mostly a matter of convenience, it was an absolute hit! Having spent all weekend indulging in rich French cuisine, my roommate and I agreed that it was refreshing to have a spice- and vegetable-heavy meal.\nFast Fact: Although India was not a French colony, several other countries were. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll find a strong culinary influence from places like Vietnam, Senegal, and Lebanon in Paris today.\n8 p.m. \u2014 Macaron tasting\nWhile macaron tasting wasn\u2019t an official item on our itinerary, we did stumble across a gourmet macaron shop later in the evening. It was amazing.\nFast Fact: Macarons and macaroons are different types of cookies. In Paris, you\u2019re mostly likely to find macarons \u2014 with a single O \u2014 which is a sandwich-style cookie. They come in a variety of flavors and can be filled with jam, buttercream icing, or ganache. Macaroons \u2014 with two O\u2019s \u2014 are coconut drop cookies commonly served around the world during Passover.\n8:30 p.m. \u2014 Taking a breather\nAfter a weekend of rushing to complete our checklist, we were grateful for the downtime we built into our itinerary for Saturday night.\nWe were too exhausted to fully take advantage of Paris nightlife, but we did enjoy strolling back past the Eiffel Tower and through the sparkling streets. We admired glamorous locals as they walked by, stopped to look at a padlock-covered bridge, and spent nearly an hour enjoying a group of street musicians as they played.\nCan You See Paris in a Weekend?\nOn Sunday morning, my roommate and I boarded our plane back to Spain. The truth was, we had only gotten a small taste of what Paris had to offer. Racing from one destination to the next had left little time for us to appreciate Paris\u2019s beauty and culture.\nDespite the exhaustion that came with the trip, however, I\u2019m glad we went on our impulsive weekend adventure. Having experienced Paris as an overly ambitious college student, I can\u2019t wait to return when I have more free time, a larger budget, and a passable knowledge of French.\nMy only hope is that I won\u2019t have to wait too long before I\u2019m back again.\nProtecting Quick Trips and Epic Adventures to Paris\nWhether you need travel medical insurance for an epic European adventure or an affordable plan fit for a backpacker\u2019s budget, Seven Corners has you covered.

You will see me refer to things I did using the Paris Pass multiple times throughout this post.\nYou can choose the number of days that you want your pass for, but it\nmust be used in consecutive days\n.\nThe more things you do from the Paris Pass, the more money you will save.\nFor a more detailed Paris Pass description, check out my post about\nWhy You Need The Paris Pass\nMuseum Lovers: Get the Paris Museum Pass\nIf you intend on seeing any of the\nmuseums\nthrough the Paris Pass, you\nMUST\nALSO\npick up a\nParis Museum Pass\n. This is NOT something you can download from the Paris Pass or Go City.\n3 Days in Paris: The Itinerary\nDay 1: Travel Day \u2013 Welcome to Paris, Wine Tasting, and the Eiffel Tower\nWhen I got to Paris, my flight landed at roughly 7:15am (most flights to Europe are overnight flights). If you can sleep on an airplane sitting up, the Lord has blessed you. I am not one of those people. After getting breakfast (a croissant and coffee, obviously), we took a much-needed nap and used the rest of the day to mostly explore.\nMy first breakfast in Paris:\npain au chocolat & caf\u00e9 au lait\nWe spent our first day familiarizing ourselves with the streets of Paris the best way I know how \u2013 by getting \u201clost!\u201d\nWhen I have free time on my travel day, I love to leave my hotel, pick a direction, and just start walking.\nYou\u2019ll be amazed at how much you discover when you have no idea what\u2019s there\u2026in fact, we even stumbled upon the Louvre this way!\nWine tasting at Les Caves du Louvre\nBooked through the\nParis Pass\n; reservation required.\nDuring the tasting, they let us taste 3 different kinds of wine (1 white, 2 red) while the sommelier educated us on the different wines in the regions of France.\nAt the end, you can buy wine and champagne from their shop next door.\nInside the wine shop\nThe front of Les Caves du Louvre\nWho doesn\u2019t love a decorative wine display?\nThe Eiffel Tower\nWe ended our first day by (what else?) seeing the\nEiffel Tower\n! I will never forget seeing it for the first time\u2026I really felt as though it had the \u201cwow\u201d factor that I always imagined it would.\nYou can see the Eiffel Tower up close \u2013 many people come sit on the grass in front of it for picnics, or even just to hang out. You can also go inside the Eiffel Tower via the\nParis Pass\n, but in my opinion, seeing it from the outside is better!\nThe Eiffel Tower lights up at dusk and stays lit until 1:00 AM (of note, it stays light outside MUCH longer in Paris, so dusk usually isn\u2019t until after 9pm!).\nEvery hour on the hour\nis a glittering light show that lasts for 5 minutes and is 100% worth seeing.\nPro Tip:\nThe Eiffel Tower\u2019s lighting and sparkling lights are protected by copyright, so professional use of images of the Eiffel Tower at night require prior authorization and may be subject to a fee.\nSeeing the Eiffel Tower for the first time!\nYou can sit on the grass right in front of the Eiffel Tower to get an up-close-and-personal view. If you want to see the Eiffel Tower from a distance, the best place is\nPlaza del Trocad\u00e9ro\n.\nThe view from Plaza del Trocad\u00e9ro\nAt the end of the plaza, there are steps you can go down to get an even better view (although, it will still be from a distance). If you go all the way to the bottom, you will be able to walk along the Seine River.\nThe Eiffel Tower & the Seine River\nDay 2: Full Day \u2013 The Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral, Saint Chapelle, Arc de Triomphe, and Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\nI\u2019m going to be honest with you:\nI am not a museum person\n.\nThe Louvre will likely be the only museum I write about, not only on this post but on this entire website. They just aren\u2019t my thing. However, if you are a museum person, Paris has a multitude of amazing ones to choose from (and some are included in the\nParis Pass\n)!\nThe Louvre from the outside\nThe Louvre\nBooked through the\nParis Pass\n; reservation required.\nGo early in the morning; you could easily spend hours here if you wanted.\nThe Louvre is CLOSED on Tuesdays.\nYou MUST also get a\nParis Museum Pass\n, which can be obtained from\nBig Bus Information Center\n. The Paris Museum Pass website is also great to browse if you want to see more museums than just the Louvre.\nWhen Mona Lisa photobombs\u2026\nThe highlight of the Louvre is, of course,\nThe Mona Lisa\nThe most famous painting in the Louvre (and quite possibly the world); painted by Leonardo da Vinci\nThere are signs in the museum that help guide you to where this painting is, and there will be a line of people waiting to get a close-up photo.\nNotre Dame and Sainte Chapelle\nThe\nNotre Dame Cathedral\nis about a 20 minute walk from the Louvre\nAs of July 2022, you are still not able to go inside due to damage from the 2019 fire, but it is still magnificent to look at from the outside.\nThe Notre Dame Cathedral has an anticipated reopening date of 2024.\nA short walk away from the cathedral is\nSainte Chapelle\n, a gothic-style cathedral originally built to house relics of Christ. Although not as famous as Notre Dame, you CAN tour this one!\nParis Pass\n\u2013 reservation required\nKnown for it\u2019s high ceilings and (equally high) gorgeous, stained-glass windows.\nChamps-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\nParis\u2019s most iconic shopping street.\nThis street has some affordable shops, but it was also very ritzy. You will find everything from Zara to Chanel.\nA nearby landmark is the\nPont Alexandre III bridge\n.You can walk across the bridge and admire its stunning, extravagant architecture, along with great views of the Seine River!\nSome of Paris\u2019s iconic shopping\nAt the opposite end of Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es from the bridge stands the\nArc de Triomphe\n, a massive structure built to honor those who died in the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars. You can make a reservation through the\nParis Pass\nto go up to the top of the tower and get a great view of the city!\nThe Arc de Triomphe at night\nDay 3: Full Day \u2013 Palace of Versailles, Le Marais, Montmartre\nThe Palace of Versailles\nThe Palace of Versailles\nThe\nPalace of Versailles\nis a\nmust-see day trip\nif you have enough time!\nBooked through\nThe Paris Pass\nYou MUST also get a\nParis Museum Pass\nto be allowed to enter the Palace.\nThe Palace of Versailles is CLOSED on Mondays.\nThere is a link on the\nGo City app\nwith the\nParis Pass\nto book your reservation time.\nThe Palace of Versallies is an absolutely magnificent building adorned in bright gold, and the interior has a variety of different chambers and suites that are replicas of the royal era.\nOriginally built by King Louis XIII to be used as a hunting lodge, and then later turned into a chateau. The chateau was eventually expanded by King Louis XIV into a palace.\nToday it is declared a\nUNESCO World Heritage site\nand is one of the top tourist attractions in the world.\nWe chose to only tour the palace since we had other things planned for today, but you could easily\nspend an entire day here\nif you wanted to.\nA glimpse inside the Palace of Versailles\nThere are ticket options that allow you to\ntour the\nGardens\n, which are\nabsolutely massive\n, and which also include the Estate of Trianon (Marie Antoinette\u2019s estate).\nTo give you an idea of\njust how massive\n:\nWalking from the Palace of Versailles to the Grand Canal of the gardens would take you 15 minutes (there are other sections of the gardens, such as Apollo\u2019s Bath Grove, that are much closer).\nWalking to the Estate of Trianon would take you 25 minutes.\nWhen touring the inside of the palace, it is important to\nenter on the right wing side\nas opposed to the left. We entered on the wrong side and ended up accidentally going out the exit way before we were ready! (Thankfully, they let us back in, but we had to go through security again!)\nEntering on the right will take you through the Gallery of the History of the Palace, and up the stairs to the Louis XIV rooms.\nFrom here, you will enter the State Apartment rooms which eventually leads to the\nHall of Mirrors\n.\nThe Hall of Mirrors was my favorite room in the entire palace. It is a massive space with huge windows, a painted ceiling, and multiple sparkling chandeliers.\nThe Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles\nExplore Le Marais\nWhen we got back to Paris, we decided to explore\nLe Marais\n, a chic, trendy spot that is known for being LGBQT+ friendly. It is a vibrant community with shops and restaurants that\u2019s located right on the Seine river. It\u2019s not a must-do, but definitely worth walking around if you have some extra time.\nWe ate at this restaurant (\nLes Deux Colombes\n), which had views of the famous\nHotel de Ville\nLes Deux Colombes in Le Marais\nMontmartre\nMontmartre is known as the\nmost romantic neighborhood of Paris\nand became my favorite area out of everything that we visited. It is what I always pictured when I envisioned the quintessential \u201cFrench neighborhood.\u201d It attracted a lot of artists back in the day, such as Ernest Hemingway and Picasso.\nMontmartre is also where you will find\nMoulin Rouge\n, where you can buy\ntickets\nto see live dancers perform cabaret shows.\nUpdate May 2024:\nI went back to Paris and finally checked Moulin Rouge off my bucket list! The show was absolutely incredible, and the theater is beautiful. However, I did not know that it was a topless cabaret show instead of a play! I was expecting something more like an NYC Broadway show. Overall, I would 100% recommend seeing it, but maaaybe leave your children at home\u2026\nMoulin Rouge\nMontmartre Walking Tour \u2013 booked through the\nParis Pass\n.\nA guide takes you up and down the streets of Montmartre and tells you about the history, landmarks, and other quintessential things you may not find on your own. This was the perfect way to familiarize ourselves with the city!\nThe tour ends at\nSacre Coeur Basilica\n, a massive Catholic church with stunning architecture. You are allowed to go inside the church and look around.\nSacre Coeur Basilica\nTwo minutes from the Sacre Coeur Basilica is a restaurant called\nAu Cadet de Gascogne\n, which was featured in the\nParis Pass\nunder\n\u201cChampagne Gourmand.\u201d\nBasically, you walk up, show them your pass, and they give you a glass of free champagne with a small tray of French pastries and desserts. Yes, you read that correctly. After walking the hills of Montmartre for the past hour and a half, it was the perfect way to relax.\nThe best way to end a tour of Montmartre!\nFree Time Suggestions\nI technically had another full day in Paris after Day #3, but did not have an itinerary planned since I already knocked out the majority of the things I wanted to do. I decided to use this day as a \u201cchill day\u201d to really take it all in. If you find yourself with extra time and want to squeeze in a few other activities, here are my top suggestions:\nTaking a Seine river cruise (\nParis Pass\n)\nCruises start every hour on the hour\nNo need to make a reservation; however, there will likely be a long line!\nMultiple walking tours throughout the city (\nParis Pass\n)\nHop on/hop off bus tour through the city (\nParis Pass\n)\nMusee d\u2019Orsay\n\u2013 this is probably Paris\u2019s second-most famous museum (only to the Louvre). Set in what used to be one of Paris\u2019s main train stations. (\nParis Pass\n)\nPere Lachaise Cemetery \u2013 Oscar Wilde is buried here! (\nParis Pass\n)\nTour\nPalais Garnier\n, Paris\u2019s opera house\nParks in Paris\nMost famous:\nJardin du Luxembourg\nand\nJardin des Tuileries\nOther parks: Parc des Buttes Chaumont, Bois de Vincennes\nAnd Lastly\u2026Do a Champagne Crawl\nIf you don\u2019t do a champagne crawl in Paris, did you even go to Paris? You can, of course, get more than just champagne at (most) of these places, but I would recommend indulging\nat least\nonce in arguably the most famous drink of France.\nPro Tip:\nA glass of champagne here is not nearly as expensive as you may think; in fact, a lot of it costs about the same as a glass of wine. (You can, of course, get crazy-expensive champagne if you\u2019re about that life!)\nToasting to Montmartre at Au Cadet de Gascogne\nWe ended up doing more than one champagne crawl due to the location of some of these places. I researched some of the top bars in Paris before I went, because I wanted not only the best drinks, but also the best aesthetics, and a little bit of cultural history.\nWe also usually started our champagne crawl at the restaurant where we had dinner. For a list of the must-try cultural foods as well as my favorite restaurants I went to, check out the\nMy Favorite Restaurants\nsection on the \u201c\nPlanning a Trip to Paris\n\u201d page.\nFrom rooftops with Eiffel Tower views to the first (and perhaps only!) TRUE champagne bar in Paris, here are my favorite bars, grouped in proximity to each other:\nThe Champagne Crawl: My Favorite Bars\nBars Near Our Hotel, Close to Arrondissement #8:\nThe Buddha Bar\n\u2013 Asian-themed bar with expensive sushi. We did not order food, but the aesthetic (and champagne) were top-tier.\nBar Hemingway\n\u2013 a small bar located in The Ritz Paris. Expect there to be a line, as seating is very limited. Hemingway frequented this bar (obviously!)\nHarry\u2019s New York Bar\n\u2013 this one has more of a sports-bar vibe. Not your traditional Paris flair; however, the staff was very nice and helpful with drink recommendations. This bar was actually Paris\u2019s first-ever cocktail bar, so we got more than just champagne here!\nFun fact: The Bloody Mary and Sidecar were both invented at this bar!\nThe stairs inside the Buddha Bar\nHarry\u2019s New York Bar\nToasting to the Buddha Bar!\nBars We Visited In Montmartre:\nLe Vrai Paris\n\u2013 Montmartre restaurant/bar with decorative flowers on the outside\nThis could also be included in the restaurant list, as their food looked AMAZING, but we only got drinks here!\nAu Cadet de Gascogne\n\u2013 Montmartre bar with the free champagne from the Paris Pass\nLe Vrai Paris\nBars Near The Eiffel Tower:\nLe Dokhan\u2019s Bar\n\u2013 Paris\u2019s original (and ONLY) champagne bar. Located inside the Dokhan\u2019s Hotel near Plaza del Trocadero.\nFun fact: This place considers themselves\nParis\u2019s only champagne bar\nbecause they are the only bar that exclusively serves\njust champagne!\nLe Rooftop at The Peninsula Hotel\n\u2013 rooftop bar with gorgeous Eiffel Tower views near Le Dokhan\u2019s.

I am so happy and jealous of you. The feeling of visiting Tokyo for the first time is one of my fondest memories of all of my travels, by far. As a repeat visitor to this beautiful city, I will impart some of my knowledge of Tokyo in this post.\nTokyo Tower from\nSkylobby at Azabudai Hill\nPlanning your trip to Tokyo\nTravel Tips for First-time Visitors\nHow to get to Tokyo\nGetting Wi-fi or Data SIM card in Tokyo\nPublic Transport in Tokyo\nWhat is a JR Pass and do I need it?\nWhere to stay in Tokyo\nTokyo Itinerary, what to do and where to go\n5-days Tokyo Itinerary\nShort Trips from Tokyo\nWant more? Here are\nmore activities\nyou can do in Tokyo\nTokyo Travel Tips for First-time Visitors\nFirst things first, let\u2019s go through all the tips that can make your travel to Tokyo easier:\n1.\nDownload the Google Translate Japanese Pack to your phone\n. It will make communication a lot easier. Aside from text translations, Google Translate can also translate writings into English. It has been useful when I go to a restaurant where the entire menu is in Japanese and the staff does not speak English \u2013 I just use the camera function and translate the menu by taking a photo of it.\n2.\nDownload the Tokyo Google Maps to your phone\n\u2013 by this, I don\u2019t just mean download the Google Maps app. You can download the whole Tokyo map to your phone so you\u2019ll use less mobile data when browsing the maps.\nHere is how to download Maps to your phone\n.\n3.\nWear comfortable walking shoes\n\u2013 Tokyo is a city with amazing public transport connectivity. On the other hand, taxis are expensive in Tokyo. So chances are, you\u2019ll be walking and exploring on foot a lot during your time in Tokyo. Wear comfortable shoes that are actually made for walking, you\u2019ll thank me later.\n4.\nDon\u2019t worry about traveling solo to Tokyo.\nTokyo is one of the safest cities in the world. Two of my trips to Tokyo were done on my own and it couldn\u2019t have been more perfect. Okay, I know there are incidents involving perverted peeping toms on the train, and I\u2019m sure crimes do still happen, but I personally have never felt scared or threatened even when I was walking alone at night.\n5.\nConsider the\nTokyo Pass\nfrom Klook to save money\n\u2013 There are lots of attractions to visit and do in Tokyo, which means you\u2019ll likely have to spend on tickets for those activities. Getting a travel pass like the Klook Tokyo Pass could ease the pain. To make it easier for you to decide whether to get the pass or not, I\u2019ll put a note on each attraction that I mention in the itinerary that could use the Tokyo pass.\nWhat is Klook?\nKlook\nis the leading travel and experiences booking website in Asia. And yes, they are legit! I personally always book my activities through them whenever I am traveling.\nSee my review of Klook here\n.\nRed Lanterns in front of a Japanese restaurant\n6.\nDo your customs and immigration procedures online\n\u2013 Visit Japan Web\u00a0is Japan\u2019s online service for immigration procedures and customs declarations. Even though it is not required, it would be beneficial for you and everyone else to complete the procedures on Visit Japan Web before you arrive. It\u2019s free, fast, and all can be done online.\nHow to use Visit Japan Web:\nNeed help using Visit Japan Web? I have written\nan extensive guide about Visit Japan Web here\n.\nHow to get to Tokyo\nThere are two airports near Tokyo: Haneda Airport (HND) and Narita Airport (NRT). Both of them are international airports.\n1. Narita vs Haneda\nI will always recommend\nflying\nto Haneda instead of Narita\nif you have the option. Why? Haneda is so much closer to the city than Narita. In fact, Haneda is actually in Tokyo \u2013 it would take you about 30 minutes to Shibuya using the local train. Narita, on the other hand, is located in Chiba. It takes about 40 to 90 minutes to get to Ueno and you need to buy a separate airport express ticket.\nBut I\u2019m not saying you should never fly into Narita. Sometimes it makes sense especially in terms of budget. I flew to Narita was when\nI took ZIPAIR budget airline from Singapore\n, and I think the price difference justified the extra hassle.\n2. Getting to Tokyo from Haneda Airport\nBy Local Train\n\u2013 If you are arriving in Haneda (HND), you\u2019ll want to take the local train as it is cost-effective. There is\nTokyo Monorail\nwhich will take you to Hamamatsucho station, where you can transfer to the JR Yamanote line to your final destination. Or, you can take the\nKeikyu Airport Line\nwhich will take you to Shinagawa station, where you can transfer to other local lines to your final destination.\nPrivate Transfer Car from Haneda\n\u2013 If you\u2019re arriving in off hours (trains only operate from 6 AM to midnight) or traveling with a group with lots of luggage, you will want to book a\nPrivate Transfer from and to HND\nto save the hassle.\n3. Getting to Tokyo from Narita Airport\nBy Airport Express Train\n\u2013 Aside from the\nNarita Express\n, there is\nTokyo Keisei Skyliner\nwhich takes you to Ueno station in 40 minutes. From Ueno, you can then transfer to the local trains to get to the station nearest to your hotel.\nTokyo Pass:\nKeisei Narita Skyliner is one of the attractions included in\nTokyo Pass\nPrivate Transfer Car from Narita\n\u2013 If you are traveling as a group or carrying a lot of luggage, I highly suggest getting a private car. On my most recent trip, I hired\na private transfer car\nfrom Narita for the three of us since we had a lot of luggage and I had a great experience. The driver was already waiting for us as we exited and we were off within 5 minutes. The airport transfer company we booked via Klook is called CHINICHI.\nOur private transfer from Narita\nby CHINICHI via Klook\nStay connected with Wi-Fi while in Tokyo\nIf there is only one tip you take away from this blog. This would be it:\nGet a SIM card for your travel!\nHaving an internet connection at all times makes traveling in Tokyo MUCH easier.\nThere are a few Wi-Fi options you can consider:\n1.\nPrepaid SIM Card\n\u2013 If you are traveling alone, you can look into\ngetting a prepaid SIM card\n. You can pick up the SIM Card once you have reached Japan at the airport (check if your airport is listed).\n2.\nData eSIM\n\u2013 However, if you\u2019d like to still be contactable from your original mobile number, I strongly suggest considering\na data eSIM option\n. It will still allow you to have unlimited data when you are in Tokyo, but you can also retain your regular SIM card.\n3.\nFor group travel\n\u2013 If you are traveling in a group, or have multiple devices, another option is to rent a pocket Wi-Fi,\nwhich you can get here\nand pick up at the airport. This provides unlimited data and you can connect multiple devices to it, up to 10 devices. You\u2019ll have to remember to charge the router every day and also remember to return the router at the end of your trip.\nHow many days should I spend in Tokyo?\nI recommend setting aside a minimum of\n5 days\nfor\u00a0Tokyo. Tokyo is MUCH bigger than you might have expected. On my first trip to Japan, I went for 7 days with aspirations of doing\na few day trips\noutside of Tokyo. That plan was quickly trumped when I realized how big this city is.\nIn the end, I allocated 5 days in Tokyo and barely managed to squeeze in two days in\nHakone\n, and it was still not enough to cover all that I wanted to do in Tokyo. I ended up coming back a few more times and on subsequent return visits, I\u2019m still discovering new sides of the city.\nAnd this is why I\u2019ve written this post as a 5-day itinerary in Tokyo!\nHow to get around Tokyo using Public Transport\nIn Tokyo, you can pretty much get anywhere you want using the train. Here is how the system works:\nTokyo Pass:\nA 72-hour subway ticket (for Tokyo Metro and Toei line) can be bought as an add-on to\nTokyo Pass\n, making it cheaper than paying for a single train fare each time.\n1. Using Local Trains with IC cards (SUICA or PASMO)\nLocal trains in Japan run on IC (Integrated Circuit) Cards. In Tokyo, you can get either SUICA or PASMO IC card. They are the exact same thing, and there is no difference in which one you get so just pick one. Whichever one you choose, this IC card will be your lifeline during your stay.\nVirtual IC Card:\nFor iPhone users, you can use your phone to pay for train fares. No need for physical IC card!\nRead here to find how to get around in Tokyo without physical IC Card\n.\nThis card allows you to tap in and out of each train station without having to buy a ticket every single time you take a train. And because everyone has an IC card Japan, you can even use your card balance to buy things from convenience stores and vending machines. Whenever the balance is running low, you can easily refill the card using cash or credit card at any train station.\n2. Virtual IC Card \u2013 How to use your iPhone as an IC Card in Japan\nGood news for\niPhone users\n\u2013 the IC cards have gone virtual and you can use your phone as an IC card. This makes everything even more convenient, as you can refill the balance via your phone without going to the station.\nTip:\nCheck out Apple\u2019s help article on how to use IC cards on iPhones\n.\nYou\ndo not need to buy a physical IC card to do this\n, just start the process straight from your phone! However, if you DO have an existing IC card you can still transfer the balance to your phone. Your existing card will then stop working and you can only use your phone as an IC card from that point onwards.\nUnfortunately for Android users, the phone needs to be bought in Japan to be able to do this. You could try using the\nPasmo mobile\n, but it is only available in Japanese.\nFor users without a smartphone, you would still need to get\na physical IC card\n.\n3. Planning your route in Tokyo\nIn terms of train schedules and routes, I\u2019m happy to report that\nGoogle Maps\nworks well in Japan. You can use it as you normally would when looking up directions, but set it to public transport mode and it will give you the best way to get from point A to point B by train. And it even tells you how much the fare would be.\nExample Tokyo Train Route on Google Maps \u2013 Shinjuku to Asakusa\nI\u2019d say that\u2019s good enough for tourists. Locals use a more comprehensive transit app called\nNaviTime\nwhich will tell you even more details such as which train car you should board to get to your transfer faster. But for me, Google Maps has always been enough.\n4. Tokyo local trains will stop running at midnight\nTrains in Tokyo are convenient and affordable, but they stop at midnight. Cabs are very expensive in Tokyo, so if you\u2019re out late, you want to make sure you still catch the last train. Most stations have trains running until midnight but as a general rule of thumb, you should be at the station by 11:30 PM. Especially if your travel involves changing lines.\nOn one of our nights out, we missed our last connecting train in Shibuya and had to take a cab back to our accommodation. The short 20-minute ride cost us $50 \ud83d\ude10\n5. Be mindful of train peak hour\nI try to stay away from using the train in the morning during rush hour, usually any time from 8-10 am on a weekday and 6-8 pm on weeknights. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about how people get pushed by sticks to encourage them to move more inside the train so that more people can get on, and you end up packed into the train like sardines.\nWhat is a JR Pass and do I need it?\nIf you\u2019re only staying in Tokyo, you don\u2019t need to get a JR Pass. An\nIC Card\nwill be enough to take trains within Tokyo. However, if you\u2019re planning to venture out of Tokyo to other cities, then you might want to look into JR Pass so you can save on train ticket costs.\nWhat is JR Pass:\nRead about JR Pass\nto find out what it is and whether you need it for your visit to Japan.\nWhere to stay in Tokyo\nWith Tokyo\u2019s extensive train system, anywhere close to a train station is a great place to stay. For a first-timer, I\u2019d try to stay close to\nShibuya, Shinjuku,\nor\nAsakusa\n. Look for a place within 15-minute walking distance or close to a train line that can take you to these areas.\nHere are a few places I would recommend in Tokyo, in different price ranges:\n1. Affordable Accommodations\nReso Poshtel in Asakusa\n($) \u2013 I stayed at a dorm in Asakusa and shared a room with 5 other women for a few nights. It was a great way to keep accommodation costs down if you are traveling alone and plan to be outside most of the time anyway. That hostel has since closed down, but Reso Poshtel looks similar.\nHotel 1899 Tokyo in Shimbashi\n($$) \u2013 Very conveniently located near the Shimbashi station, which is a good base for exploring the city.\n2. Mid-range Accommodation\nMUJI Hotel in Ginza\n($$$) \u2013 If you\u2019re a fan of the minimalist Japanese home goods brand MUJI, you\u2019ve got to stay at this hotel. The rooms are decorated with that classic Japanese feel, similar to how the MUJI stores look like. The hotel is next to the flagship MUJI store, located conveniently in Ginza, one of the major stations in Tokyo.\nThe Strings by Intercontinental in Shinagawa\n($$$) \u2013 This one is a more expensive option as I stayed here during a business trip, but this hotel was convenient. It\u2019s right on top of Shinagawa station, which is close to both Shibuya and Haneda Airport. There are several convenience stores and a shopping mall in the same complex as the hotel. Also, it\u2019s one of the taller buildings in this area. On a clear day, you can see Mount Fuji.\n3. Luxury Accommodation\nHotel Gajoen Tokyo in Meguro\n($$$$) \u2013 If you want a taste of old Japanese luxury while in Tokyo, then look no further than this hotel. This beautiful yet little-known hotel is located in Meguro. I did not know this hotel even existed until my very recent visit to Tokyo, where I wanted to visit an exhibit within the hotel. I was blown away by how beautiful the hotel is! Supposedly, it\u2019s the hotel that inspired the popular anime\nSpirited Away\n.\nThe Ritz Carlton Tokyo in Roppongi\n($$$$) \u2013 Conveniently located in Roppongi, The Ritz in Tokyo is a great option. The lobby is located on the 53rd floor, which means all their room will give you a great view of Tokyo from above!\nThe Tokyo 5-Day Itinerary\nTokyo is a massive metropolitan city. It\u2019s worth planning your trip and grouping the days by areas so that you don\u2019t waste time. This is the basis of how I\u2019ve structured the itineraries below \u2013 I\u2019ve put together some must-visits in sections\nbased on their proximity to each other\nso that you can optimize your trip by choosing which sights you want to visit on the same day.\nPlease note that these itineraries\nare not meant to be done chronologically\nso you can mix and match your days. Also, don\u2019t feel bad if you did not get to do everything\u2026 It\u2019s just an excuse to come back to Tokyo \ud83d\ude42\nHere are quick shortcuts to the itinerary for each day:\nDay 1\n: Yoyogi Park, Harajuku, Omotesando, and Roppongi\nDay 2\n: Shibuya and its surrounding areas\nDay 3\n: Akihabara, Ueno Park, and Asakusa\nDay 4\n: Shinjuku\nDay 5\n: Tuna Auction, Ginza, Imperial Castle and Shrines\nDay 6 Onward\n: Take day trips (or short trips) away from Tokyo\nWant more?

The places I\u2019m going to mention today are better to be visited on weekends!\n1. Visit Yoyogi Park and Meiji Jingu\nYou can start your day by exploring\nYoyogi Park\n. It\u2019s a huge park with a pleasant shaded walk and all of the walking routes will go through\nMeiji Jingu\n, a beautiful Shinto shrine, where you can buy an amulet and other traditional souvenirs.\nDon\u2019t forget to do the\nwater purification ritual\nat the temple entrance. Every temple in Japan will have a small fountain with some wooden ladles. Take some water using the ladle, then transfer some of that water to your hands and use it to wash your mouth. Do NOT use the ladle directly to wash your mouth!\nIf you\u2019re visiting on a weekend, you might even see a Shinto wedding there as well. I was lucky enough to see one when I visited.\nThe Meiji Shrine\nPrayer boards at Meiji Jingu\nA Shinto wedding at Meiji Jingu\n2. Explore Harajuku\nNext, you can check out\nHarajuku\n, a walkable distance from Yoyogi Park (it\u2019s actually right across from it), and walk along\nTakeshita Dori\n. Harajuku embodies everything you\u2019ve heard about modern Japan \u2013 It\u2019s a crazy area filled with people, trendy shops, and street food.\nHarajuku became well-known as the hangout spot for the trendy youngsters who would wear their most outrageous, fashion-forward outfits. Sadly, this is a dying culture and they\u2019re not seen as often as they used to, so to increase your chance of spotting these trendsetters you might want to visit on a weekend.\nI can easily spend 2-3 hours in Harajuku just walking and looking at the various shops. I recommend dropping by\nLaforet\n, a shopping center at the end of Takeshita Dori. Harajuku is full of unusual fashion items on its own, but Laforet is probably the center of all the crazy fashion.\nAnd you\u2019ve got to try\nJapanese Crepes\nwhile you\u2019re here! That\u2019s what the Harajuku area is known for. There are also a bunch of other cute eats on the street, such as the\nanimal-shaped gelato\nfrom Eiswelt Gelato. If you\u2019re keen to try the viral\nI\u2019m Donut?\ndonuts, there is a branch in Harajuku as well. They\u2019re known for their mochi-like donuts and long queue. I personally wouldn\u2019t queue for it, but I was lucky to pass by there once when there were only 3-4 people in line.\nHarajuku\u2019s Takeshita Dori\n3. Omotesando, Aoyama & Roppongi\nIf you keep walking along Takeshita Dori towards the east, you\u2019ll end up in\nOmotesando\n,\nAoyama\n, and then\nRoppongi\n.\u00a0 In total, this is about a 3km walk from Harajuku station and very pedestrian friendly. The entire route is lined up with shops and food.\nHere are some notable places you can stop by on your walk:\nTokyu Plaza Omotesando Harajuku\nfor a quick photo op too. This building has these geometric-shaped mirrors on the ceiling and it makes for an\namazing\npicture.\nMoMA Design Store Omotesando\n\u2013 MoMA is the Museum of Modern Arts in\nNYC\n, but they have a few stores in Tokyo selling some of the best-rated items.\nNezu Museum\nin Aoyama \u2013 East Asian art museum with a private collection\nTokyu Plaza Omotesando Harajuku\nTokyu Plaza Omotesando Harajuku\n4. Roppongi Hills\nI recommend ending your day at the\nTokyo City View Observation Deck\nin Roppongi Hills where you can take the lift up to the rooftop and get an amazing view of the city, including the iconic red Tokyo tower, for just 1,800 yen. If you\u2019re lucky and the day is clear, you might even see Mount Fuji! I recommend going close to sunset to get the best lighting for photos. Make sure you stay a little bit after sunset too for nighttime photography.\nYou can book the\nTokyo City View Observation Deck Admission Ticket\u00a0here\n, which I recommend since it\u2019s cheaper than buying on the spot.\nTokyo Pass:\nThe Tokyo City View is one of the attractions included in\nTokyo Pass\nAt the rooftop of Tokyo Skydeck in Roponggi\nSunset from the Tokyo Sky Deck roof top\nTokyo Tower from the Sky Deck\nPreviously, it was also possible to top up your ticket to visit the Sky Deck, which is an outdoor rooftop area. However, the Sky Deck\u00a0is unfortunately closed from September 2023.\nIf you are a museum person,\nMori Art Museum\nis also in the same building, and access to the permanent exhibition is included with the observation deck ticket. They might have an interesting exhibit to check out too, but you need to buy the ticket separately.\nBut if you are a fan of Japanese wood interior design, then head to\nTokyo Midtown\nin Roppongi, the most aesthetic mall I\u2019ve been to. It also has great stores to get souvenirs from.\nWhere to eat and drink in Harajuku, Omotesando, Aoyama, and Roppongi\nJapanese Crepes at Harajuku\n. This can be found all throughout the famous Takeshita Dori in Harajuku, so just snap them up whenever you see a stall. It wouldn\u2019t be a very big stall, usually just enough for one person to serve you the crepes through the stall window. You can customize your crepe with different fruit toppings and sweet syrup.\nZaku Zaku Ice Cream\n.\u00a0\u201cZaku-zaku\u201d is Japanese onomatopoeia for something crispy/crunchy (I swear, Japanese people have sounds for everything). As soon as you enter the shop, you can smell a delicious buttery sweet and savory aroma wafting in the air \u2013 similar to caramel popcorn but BETTER. This place is actually famous for its creampuff, filled with Hokkaido cream which is made fresh on the spot and coated with their crispy \u2018croquant\u2019 made from baked almonds. But the Harajuku store also has an ice cream version that is exclusive to this branch.\nEiswelt Gelato\non Harajuku \u2013 This shop has the cutest animal-shaped gelato!  Take note though, It\u2019s only open on weekends.\nMaisen Tonkatsu at Omotesando\nMaisen Tonkatsu in Omotesando\n(\nmaps\n). While walking around Omotesando, be sure to stop by here for one of the best tonkatsu in town. Their specialty is Kurobuta aka the Japanese black pork. Their tonkatsu set can get pretty pricey, but there are cheaper alternatives such as the cutlet rice bowl.\nSincere Garden for a vegetarian option in Omotesando\n(\nmaps\n). My friends will be surprised I\u2019m recommending a vegetarian restaurant, yet here we are. Long story short, I made a friend at the hostel I was staying at in Asakusa and ended up tagging along for lunch with him and his Tokyo friends. We ended up at this vegetarian place that serves all organic food in Omotesando. For someone who loves meat as much as I do, this was actually a very decent meal! I feel that it fits perfectly with the trendy vibe of Omotesando. The entire cafe has this light wooden theme and made me feel good about eating healthy food.\nTempuraya Miyagawa in Aoyama\n(\nmaps\n) \u2013 A small establishment offering tempura set at lunch and omakase multi-course tempura at dinner. I think it\u2019s better to go during lunch, but dinner should be great too.\nTokyo Whisky Library\n(\nmaps\n) \u2013 Great place to try whisky if you\u2019re a fan, including the famous Japanese whisky.\nDay 2: Shibuya and its surrounding areas (Ebisu, Nakameguro, Daikanyama, and Shimokitazawa)\nFor this day, we will be exploring Shibuya, one of the major areas of Tokyo. This itinerary can be done any day, on weekdays, or on weekends.\n1. The Famous Shibuya Scramble Crossing\nCheck out Shibuya for the famous\nShibuya Scramble Crossing\n, where every few minutes the pedestrian light turns green and the entire crossing will be filled with a ton of people coming from all directions.\nThe famous Shibuya Scramble Crossing\nLocated just outside the Shibuya station, this crossing has been featured in many movies, video games, and music videos. It\u2019s an unusual scene and the true definition of organized chaos \u2013 everybody is going everywhere in all directions but amazingly, nobody is bumping into each other.\nI recommend doing this during the day to see the craziness in all its glory. There is a famous\nStarbucks\nwhere people love to sit and watch the scramble crossing from, but I find it to be quite crowded so I prefer to just watch from ground zero (plus it\u2019s free!).\nShibuya Scramble Crossing from the 46th Floor of\nShibuya Sky\n2. Statue of Hachiko, the loyal dog\nAt one corner of the scramble crossing, you can check out the famous\nHachiko Statue\n. Hachiko is a legendary Japanese dog who is famous for being extremely loyal. He kept waiting for his owner\u2019s return at the train station, years after he had passed away. His loyalty touched the heart of many Japanese and he has become immortalized in front of Shibuya station, waiting forever for his owner.\nShibuya is a major train station and it can get pretty confusing when you are trying to meet up with friends, so the Hachiko statue has become a famous meeting point.\nHachiko, the loyal dog\n3. Shibuya Sky Observation Deck\nIf you fancy seeing Tokyo from above, the\nShibuya Sky observation deck\nis a great choice. This is one of the newest observation decks in Tokyo, having opened to the public in early 2020, and in my opinion the\nbest view of Tokyo from above\nthat you can get at the moment.\nIt is currently the most popular observation deck in Tokyo,\nyou\u2019ll need to\nbook tickets\nahead of time\n. You can read\nmy post about visiting Shibuya Sky\nfor more information.\nYoyogi Park from Shibuya Sky\nTokyo Pass:\nThe Shibuya Sky observation deck is one of the attractions included in\nTokyo Pass\n4. Shopping in Shibuya\nYou can take your time exploring more of Shibuya. It\u2019s a huge shopping district and you can even say it\u2019s the center of Tokyo, along with Shinjuku.\nCheck out\nShibuya Loft\nfor floors of random home goodies, each floor with its own theme. You can also check out\nDon Quijote\n(aka Donki) for even more random stuff, or\nNitori\nfor home goodies similar to IKEA. For general shopping, I recommend checking out\nHikarie\nbuilding, which features lots of Japanese brands and goodies you can buy for yourself or loved ones at home.\nFamous 109 Shibuya Building. This exact angle was featured in one of my favorite video games \u2013 The World Ends With You.\n5. Nightlife in Dogenzaka\nIf you are tired or shopping is not your thing, I recommend going to\nDogenzaka\narea. Formerly a yakuza hangout, Dogenzaka is now filled with ramen shops, pubs, izakaya (small stalls selling skewered meats), and even\u2026 love hotels. It\u2019s a good place to be if you are there for the nightlife.\nDogenzaka at night\n6. Neighborhoods near the Shibuya area\nIf you still have some energy after the madness that is Shibuya, you can take the train to\nShimokitazawa,\nDaikanyama\n, Naka-Meguro, or Ebisu\nfor some cafes and check out the nightlife. These are more laid-back residential areas.\nTip:\nYou can check out my\nDaikanyama Guide\nfor more information on what you can find and do in Daikanyama.\nChilled-out streets of Shimokitazawa. There was even ambient music playing on a loudspeaker\nDolce Tacubo in\nDaikanyama\nWhere to eat in Shibuya and its surroundings\nIchiran Ramen in Shibuya\n(\nmaps\n) for the famous Tonkotsu Ramen from a vending machine. Basically, you go up to a vending machine outside the restaurant, punch in your order, receive a ticket based on your order, make payment, then wait to get seated in your own personal cubicle to slurp on your ramen. They have many other branches around the city, so you don\u2019t have to eat this in Shibuya.\nKatsukichi Bodaijyu in Shibuya\n(\nmaps\n) \u2013 Tonkatsu is one of the most popular meals in Japan, so you have to try it at least once while you are here, and if you eat pork. As a bonus, I love the decor of this place.\nKushiyaki Bistro Fukumimi in Dogenzaka\n(\nmaps\n) \u2013 If you want to experience an izakaya (bar) in Tokyo, this is the place to go.\nGyukatsu Motomura in Shibuya\n(\nmaps\n) \u2013 This place seats only 8 people at a time and you eat at the counter. There are two branches in Shibuya that are within 10-minute walk of each other, but they are both popular. Even though I came here at 2 PM, the line was still very long. They are famous for Gyukatsu, which is deep-fried and breaded beef. You\u2019ll also get a personal stone stove which you can use to further grill your beef slices to the desired doneness.\nShiro-Hige Cream Puff Factory in Shimokitazawa\n(\nmaps\n) \u2013 Located a short walk away from Shimokitazawa station and tucked inside a very quiet residential area, this cafe is known for its Totoro-shaped Creampuff. The creampuff costs 420 yen each. I recommend having the creampuffs to go bc there is an extra fee for having it at the cafe (it becomes 465 yen). They come in four flavors (custard, chocolate, strawberry and green tea) but I personally think the regular custard one is the best.\nMy Okonomiyaki at Hiroki in Shimokitazawa\nHiroki in Shimokitazawa\n(\nmaps\n) for Okonomiyaki in Shimokitazawa. There are only 8 seats in this hole-in-the-wall restaurant. For each Okonomiyaki, you get to pick soba or udon as the noodle base, then add on toppings as you want.\nThere was no English menu\n(UPDATE: I have been told there is now an English menu!). Try to sit on the counter if you can, this is where you can watch the action as it happens. The chef will cook and mix your Okonomiyaki for you according to order and once done, he will push it to the hot plate area in front of you so the Okonomiyaki stays warm as you eat it off the counter\u2019s hot plate.\nI also highly suggest visiting\nDaikanyama\nfor one of your meals. Daikanyama has been dubbed the Brooklyn of Tokyo and they have tons of cool restaurants and cafes \u2013 you can check out my\nDaikanyama guide here\nEbisu Yokocho in Ebisu\n(\nmaps\n) \u2013 This was a random surprise find for me. I was just aimlessly walking around Ebisu when I decided to go into a random building that seemed very unassuming on the outside. Once inside, I was greeted with a lively atmosphere of people eating and drinking in rows upon rows of small restaurants. Sure enough, none of them had an English menu, but just put on your brave face and try something new. I randomly chose a modern sushi joint and was able to order with my very limited Japanese. I ended up with a plate of beef and mushroom sushi\u2026 which is interesting as that\u2019s not what you\u2019d normally expect.\nThe lively Ebisu Yokocho\nDay 3: Akihabara, Ueno Park, and Asakusa\nTips:\nTry to do this itinerary on a\nSunday\n, since Akihabara streets are car-free on Sundays from 1-6 pm\n1. Akihabara\nAs a first-time Tokyo visitor, you HAVE to check out\nAkihabara\nto experience firsthand all the unique and unusual things you\u2019ve heard about Japan \u2013 the infamous Maid cafe, cat cafes, electronics, comic books, and floors and floors of arcade games, just to name a few.\nIf you go on a\nSunday\n, they close up the street from cars and open it up for pedestrians so you can roam around freely.\nAkihabara on a Sunday car-free day\nVideo games and cafes at Akihabara\n2. Asakusa and Ueno Park\nThen once you\u2019re done with Akihabara, you can walk to\nUeno Park\nfor an afternoon stroll. If that\u2019s not your thing, then you can head straight to\nAsakusa\n. Asakusa is a backpacker district so there are lots of cheap food and shopping you can do here.\nCheck out\nSenso-ji\n, a famous Buddhist temple. There is a cool street in front of this temple, called\nNakamise Shopping Street\n, which has lots of street food you can try and souvenir stalls (PS: This was where one of my earliest\nGirl Eat World\nshots was taken). If history is your thing, the\nEdo-Tokyo Museum\nis also near this area.\nBlack Sesame Agemanju from Nakamise Street\nNakamise Shopping Street in front of the Asakusa Sensoji Temple\nI went to a smaller shrine and found a mikoshi!\nThe small festival around the temple\n3. Tokyo Skytree Observation Deck\nTokyo Skytree is currently the primary television and radio broadcast of the Kanto region. When Tokyo Skytree was built in 2010, it became the tallest structure in Japan. At its full height of 634m, it also became the tallest tower in the world.\nEarly Bird Ticket is cheaper!\nThere is a 300-400 yen discount if you\nbuy the ticket online ahead of time\n. Buying tickets on the same day is more expensive.\nTokyo Skytree is located only 20 minutes away from Asakusa, so it\u2019s a great option if you\u2019re looking for an observatory and haven\u2019t been to one on this trip.\nView from Tembo Deck at\nTokyo Skytree\nThe area is also a great choice to spend a few hours in \u2013 aside from the observation decks, there are also the Sumida Aquarium, Tenku Planetarium, and shopping malls with great food options at the bottom of SkyTree Tower.\nWhere to eat\nBeerbal \u30d3\u30a2\u30d0\u30eb NAGAOKAYA\n(\nmaps\n) \u2013 I actually came across their stall while I was at\nFuji Rock Festival\nthrough an acquaintance\u2019s recommendation. Their lamb chops were seriously the best I\u2019ve had. I still dream about it, so I stalked them down and found out that they have a restaurant/beer garden in Ueno. Please give them a visit and let me know how you like it!\nDay 4: Explore Shinjuku\nShinjuku is a major area in Tokyo. It has offices, pubs, restaurants, and izakayas. If you\u2019ve seen that iconic photo of a street in Japan filled with neon lights (like the one below) it was probably taken in Shinjuku. Shinjuku deserves its own itinerary because this area is massive.\nA typical sight in Shinjuku\nHere is what you can do in Shinjuku:\n1. Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden\nStart your day with a walk at\nShinjuku Gyoen National Garden\nfor a peaceful stroll. The park is just a short walk from Shinjuku station.\nAutumn in Shinjuku Gyoen\nShinjuku Gyoen is especially popular during the\nSakura season\nin spring and\nMomiji season\nin the fall. There is an entry fee of\n500 yen\nfor every adult, but kids 15 and under can enter for free. If you ask me, it\u2019s worth every cent! You can use your IC card to enter the park or buy a ticket at the entrance.\nJapanese Garden in Shinjuku Gyoen\nThe park has great amenities \u2013 clean restrooms, vending machines with hot and cold drinks, plenty of food options, snacks, and even Starbucks inside the park.\n2. Go up Tokyo Metropolitan Building for a free observatory\nSitting at 202 meters above ground at the\nTokyo Metropolitan Government building\n(or\nTocho\nfor short), the observatory is free for the public. There is a cafe at the observatory where you can get drinks and soft serve, as well as a souvenir shop.\nBest skyline view of Tokyo:\nRead my round-up on\nthe best places to get a nice view in Tokyo here\n.\nTokyo Metropolitan Government Observatory\n3. Visit Omoide Yokocho\nFirst, visit\nOmoide Yokocho\n. \u201cOmoide\u201d means memory and \u201cYokocho\u201d is a lane / small alley, so loosely translated as you are walking down memory lane\u2026 everything here feels nostalgic, traditional Japan. There are tons of little stalls (izakaya) and while most don\u2019t have any\u00a0English menu, some have pictures.\nI suggest going with Google Translate if you plan to know everything you are eating. Otherwise, just point your fingers and be surprised. They mostly serve small skewered meats but be warned that they aren\u2019t exactly cheap. You can drink beer or whiskey highball here too.\nOmoide Yokocho\nMe and my new friends at a small izakaya! Just kidding, I was eating alone \ud83d\ude1b\nThe result of pointing randomly at food photos at an izakaya\n4. Golden Gai\nAfter the show, you can head over to\nGolden Gai\nfor some nightlife. This area was super cool! It was filled with tiny bars with different themes, so you can easily bar hop to your heart\u2019s content \u2013 provided you are fine that each bar will have a cover charge of $5-10.\nMy friends and I at the now defunct Robot Restaurant in  Golden Gai Shinjuku\nWhile Tokyo is generally safe, Golden Gai might be an area where you want to be a bit more alert as the area could be tourist trappy and you might run into unsavory crowds. They also do not like photos taken within the area of Golden Gai. A couple of iPhone shots are probably okay, but\ndo not go there and snap photos with a camera gear\n.\nIf you are staying out late, keep in mind the last train in Tokyo is just before midnight so you have to make sure you are on the train platform by then. Or else you will have to fork out some cash for the taxi ride back home.\nWhere to eat/go in Shinjuku\nTatsukichi\n(\nmaps\n). We went for dinner based on a local Tokyo friend\u2019s recommendation. They were quite packed during dinner so be prepared to wait. It\u2019s an omakase-style restaurant, meaning they will just keep serving you whatever they are cooking until you ask for the bill. Their specialty is Kushiage \u2013 deep-fried vegetable/meat skewers \u2013 and although it might seem daunting and unhealthy to eat fried food for a meal, I swear all of them were good, super crispy, and not overly oily. With each skewer, the chef will tell you which sauce to use. If I remember correctly, we each spent S$50 after 10-12 skewers and 2 whiskey highballs.\nTsukemen Gonokami\n(\nmaps\n)\nTatsunoya Tsukemen\nOne of the deep-fried veggies at Tasukichi\nDay 5: Tuna Auction, Ginza, Imperial Castle and Shrines\nFor this day, you\u2019ll start your day early to see the famous fish market in Tokyo, followed by visiting cultural sites such as the Imperial Castle and a few shrines around the area.\n1. Tuna Auction at Toyosu Fish Market\nIf you love food, visiting fish markets in Tokyo is a must. It\u2019s not that they have the best sushi in Tokyo, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t beat the atmosphere at the fish market. Fishermen arrive at the crack of dawn with their daily catch, and most importantly \u2013 the Tuna auction, where sushi tycoons have been known to bid crazy amounts of money for the best fish \u2013 the most expensive Tuna ever paid was $800,000!\nThe center of this fishermen\u2019s activity used to be at Tsukiji Market, but as of October 2018, the tuna viewing and the wholesale market have been moved to Toyosu Market. I have not been to Toyosu yet \u2013 I heard it\u2019s massive, sterile-looking, and modern compared to the old Tsukiji, but I reckon it\u2019s still worth visiting.\nTsukiji Market after the crazy morning bustle\nIf you want to see the Tuna auction, you\u2019ll have to come to Toyosu Market very early at 5 AM. You can then watch the auction from a gallery above which is open to the public. You do not need a ticket for the gallery, but if you want to watch the auction from a closer point of view, you\u2019ll need to enter a lottery.\nYou can do so here\n.\nAfter the auction, you can go for an amazing breakfast of freshly made sushi. There are some sushi stalls worth checking out at Toyosu. The crowd\u2019s favorite is\nSushi Dai\nand\nSushi Daiwa\n. But if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t want to queue, then honestly? Just pick a random stall with the shortest queue. I did exactly this and it turned out just fine \u2013 the sushi I had was delicious! You can either order a sushi set or do an omakase set, where the chef will serve you whatever sushi they can make with the ingredients they have for the day.\nTuna Auction and Toyosu Market Tour:\nIt can be a little intimidating to visit the fish market by yourself, so I do recommend\njoining the Tuna auction tour\nwhich will give you a guide and a tour to the fish market.\nTake note that the market is\nclosed on Sundays and Japanese public holidays\n, so check before you go. I tried to go during one of their public holidays and had to come back the next day.\nIf you don\u2019t mind a bit of travel, I recommend checking out the sushi stalls at\nTsukiji Outer Market\nfor the original fish market vibe.\n16-piece sushi for breakfast? Why not! For the record, I finished them all by myself\n2. Visit teamLab Exhibitions \u2013 teamLab Borderless and teamLab Planets\nIn the past decade, teamLab has established itself to be at the forefront of the digital interactive art scene. Their installations are always a delight to see and interact with. I\u2019m lucky there is a permanent teamLab exhibition in\nSingapore\nso I\u2019m not a stranger to their work, but I still made the time to check out their Tokyo exhibitions.\nteamLab Borderless \u2013 Forest of resonating lamps\nThere are two teamLab exhibitions in Tokyo,\nteamLab Borderless\nand\nteamLab Planets\n. teamLab Borderless was temporarily closed, but has reopened by February 2024 in the new Azabudai Hills area. teamLab Planets is still open with plans to close it in 2027, after which it might close down to move to another location as well.\nBuy tickets ahead:\nThese exhibitions are very popular, so you will want to purchase tickets and book timeslots for visiting\nteamLab Planets\nand\nteamLab Borderless\nahead of time via Klook. It\u2019s a direct QR code entry so you don\u2019t need to buy tickets when you get there.\nTokyo Pass:\nBoth teamLab Planets and teamLab Borderless are included in\nTokyo Pass\nIn terms of which one to visit \u2013 both of them share similar themes (interactive digital arts) but very different experiences. teamLab Borderless is probably more famous since they\u2019re more visually appealing, but teamLab Planets are more interactive.\nOne of the exhibitions in teamLab Planets\nBoth exhibitions are time-based, meaning you need to book a time slot to visit. I suggest picking a time when it\u2019s off hours if you want to avoid the crowd \u2013  try going early when they first open. Weekends or public holidays are definitely a no-go. I happened to be there during peak time and spent 40 minutes lining up outside.\n3. Ginza\nOnce done with the teamLab exhibition, you can walk back in the direction of the train station and walk around\nGinza\nfor high-end shopping. For the lovers of Japanese clothing brands\nMUJI\nand\nUniqlo\n, you\u2019ll be happy to know that both Uniqlo and MUJI have their global flagship store located in Ginza, along with the famous MUJI hotel.\nOn weekend and public holiday afternoons, the main street in Ginza is closed for cars so pedestrian can take a stroll on the street.\n4. Tokyo Station\nYou could also stop by\nTokyo Station\n, which is only one station away from Ginza. It\u2019s weird to be visiting a station, I know, but the BASEMENT of Tokyo station is seriously a gem. There is\nTokyo Ramen Street\n,\nTokyo Character Street\n, and\nTokyo Food Street\n.\nWhat might be of interest to most people is probably Tokyo Character Street, where you can find beloved characters like Hello Kitty, Pokemon, Studio Ghibli characters, etc. Take note most of the character shops close by 8:30 PM.\nAlso, Tokyo Station is an excellent place for omiyage (gift) shopping for stuff you can bring back home, so it\u2019s great to hit up on your last day.\n5. Imperial Castle, Atago Shrine and Hie Shrine\nIf you want something a bit more traditional Japan, visit the\nImperial Castle\nwhich is also nearby. Or, you could climb the\nStairway of Success at Atago Shrine\n. Supposedly, the 86 steps represent the journey to success, and to this day, many would come to pray for their professional success at Atago Shrine.\nAtago Shrine in Tokyo\nStairway of Success at Atago Shrine\nAnother shrine you can visit that is in the vicinity is\nHie Shrine\n, a Shinto shrine in Akasaka. Not many visitors know about this shrine, but I visited on the first day of the new year and the shrine was packed with locals doing\nHatsumode\n, their first prayer of the new year.\nHie Shrine in Akasaka\nThe main draw of this shrine for me is the rows of torii at the back entraince of the shrine. It reminds me of\nKyoto\n!\nTorii at Hie Shrine\nWhere to eat\nRokurinsha in Tokyo Station\n(\nmaps\n) \u2013 Tsukemen is a type of ramen that\u2019s served cold and with a separate broth for the noodles to be dipped into. Rokurinsha is a Tsukemen shop located in the basement of Tokyo station, and it\u2019s a classic beloved by tourists and locals. Expect a long queue unless you\u2019re going at an off-hour and on weekdays. I went here on a Wednesday at 8 pm and waited 30 minutes in line. But really though, it was worth every minute. If you find the queue is too long, you can come back here again on the Day 5 itinerary (scroll down below) OR you can have it on your way out of Japan if you are flying through Haneda airport.\nOnigiriya Marutoyo at Tsukiji Outer Market\n(\nmaps\n)\nGinza Bairin Main Shop\n(\nMaps\n)\nNingyocho Imahan Ginza\n(\nMaps\n)\nShort trips from Tokyo: Easy Day trips and excursions\nWhat to mix up the Tokyo metropolitan city life with nature, temple visits, and countryside living?

Take a Sunset Cruise around the Tokyo Bay\nSymphony Cruise is a cruising company that runs multiple cruises around the Tokyo Bay. Starting from Hinode Pier, you\u2019ll be able to take a 2-hour cruise while being served a 5-course fine dining meal. It\u2019s a great way to spend an afternoon in Tokyo.\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nDive deeper:\nRead my experience\nonboard their sunset cruise here\nSunset Cruise around the Tokyo Bay\n2. Go on a ramen tour around Tokyo\nYou can\u2019t come to Japan and not try ramen. If you\u2019re a fan of this comforting noodle dish, definitely try this\nTokyo Ramen Tour\n. I went on this tour during one of my visits to Tokyo. Although I\u2019ve had plenty of ramen in my life, they were mostly Tonkotsu ramen (pork bone broth). I learned a lot about other types of ramen from Frank\u2019s tour.\nMy tip? Come with an empty stomach. Seriously, because you\u2019ll be trying many different types of ramen during your visit \u2013\nup to 6 bowls\nof tasting-portion ramen. I was so stuffed (but happy) by the time we were done with the tour.\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nBook\nTokyo Ramen Tour\nhere\n3. Eat Onigiri from any Japanese Konbini (Convenience Store)\nConvenience stores (called \u201cKonbini\u201d in Japanese) are an integral part of Japanese cities. The Konbini\u2019s that can be commonly found in Japan are Family Mart (Famima for short), Lawsons, 7/11, and Daily Yamazaki.\nMy fondest memory of Japan has always been going into a Konbini first thing in the morning to see what Onigiri they have that day. Onigiri is this triangle-shaped rice wrapped in seaweed and stuffed with various fillings, perfect to eat as a snack on the go. My personal favorite is the salmon onigiri. There is something magical about the combination of salmon, rice, and seaweed.\nRows of neatly stacked Onigiri \u2013 my personal heaven\n4. The original Midori Sushi at Umegaoka\nEating sushi while you are in Japan is undeniably a must-do. While staying at an Airbnb apartment in Tokyo, I got to know one of my roommates, a Japanese guy who kindly offered to drive me to his favorite local sushi joint. It\u2019s called Midori Sushi \u2013 they are famous for being affordable yet offering high-quality food.\nLoooooooong tailed sushi at Midori sushi\nThey have a few branches in Tokyo, but the original one is at Umegaoka and is located in a very local residential area. They are famous for shaping their nigiri such that the meat topping forms this very long \u201ctail\u201d, much longer than normal.\n5. Visit Studio Ghibli Museum\nAny Japanese anime fan must visit the Studio Ghibli Museum. I went here on my very first visit to Tokyo as I am a huge fan. The museum is located in\nMitaka\n\u2013 not too far away from Shibuya. At the studio, you can see their early sketches, watch a short animation, and buy some Ghibli merchandise. It\u2019s a bit small though so I would say you only need to set aside 2 hours for this museum.\nVisiting Studio Ghibli Museum as an English-speaking tourist has gotten easier over the years. A few years ago, you could only get tickets in person at a Lawson\u2019s branch and the instructions were all in Japanese. Lucky for you, these days Studio Ghibli tickets can be booked online (and in English too).\nYou can read here\nfor instructions on how to obtain a ticket\n, but you still have to\nbook this a month in advance\nand book for a specific day and time slot.\nAnd yes, Studio Ghibli is popular and tickets DO sell out a month in advance. If it has sold out online, you can try getting them as part of a tour here:\nGhibli Museum Tour\n. As a bonus, you\u2019ll get to visit the beautiful Hotel Gajoen as well!\n6. Shop Japanese Brands and a variety of stores\nI love shopping for random goods while in Japan, especially for home goods. On my recent trip, I discovered\nLOFT\nat Shibuya and I was just blown away by the sheer amount of shopping you can do there! They sell everything and anything, from home goods, kitchen wares, stationeries, and clothing. Another similar shop is\nTokyu Hands\n.\nI also love checking out eclectic discount stores like\nDon Quijote\nand\nDaiso\n, guaranteed to be fun and easy on your wallet. They carry everything from snacks to home goods and skin care. Living in Singapore, we have a lot of Daiso and Donki stores, but the experience in Japan is still different.\nIf you like home goods, you might be interested to check out\nNittori\n. They are like IKEA, but Japanese.\nIf you\u2019re into shoes, you can\u2019t miss\nABC Mart\n, the best shop for kicks in Japan. They have regular ABC Mart, and\nABC Mart Grandstage\nfor more premium shoes. I bought some Nikes when I was in Tokyo \u2013 they are much cheaper than in Singapore.\nAnd of course, you should check out the famous Japanese clothing brands like\nUniqlo\nand\nMUJI\n, even if you have them in your home country. They are usually about 20% cheaper in Japan.\n7. Visit the Lucky Cat temple in Gotokuji\nJust a few stops away from Shinjuku, you can find a lovely neighborhood called\nGotokuji\n, where you can find cat-themed items and pastries, as well as a temple filled with Maneki Neko figurines.\nRead about\nmy visit to Gotokuji Temple here\nManeki Neko at\nGotokuji Temple\n8. Eat all the delicious food in Tokyo\nTokyo is a great city for foodies. There are so much good food in this city! While I already have a lot of food recommendations baked into the itinerary above, if your main interest is food, you will want to check out my dedicated\nTokyo Food Guide\npost. I listed 20 dishes you will want to try when you\u2019re in the city and where to have them!\nTempura Soba Set, just one of the many\ndelicious food you can have in Tokyo\n9. Visit Hotel Gajoen \u2013 the \u201cmuseum hotel\u201d\nI know you\u2019re probably wondering why I\u2019m recommending you to visit a hotel when you\u2019re in Tokyo. But trust me on this \u2013 Hotel Gajoen is truly a special hotel. Supposedly, it\u2019s the hotel that inspired the aesthetic of the popular anime \u201cSpirited Away\u201d.\nHotel Gajoen Lobby\nI only came across this hotel on what must be my 7th or 8th visit to Tokyo, and only because I happened to be working nearby at AWS Loft in Meguro. I thought I\u2019d just drop by quickly for the Hina doll exhibit, but I ended up staying at the hotel for hours and snapped so many pictures because the entire hotel is so beautiful!\nHotel Gajoen Lobby\nAnd yes,\nHyakudan Kaidan\n(Hundred steps), located in the hotel lobby, is very much worth a visit as well. I visited when they were having a Hinamatsuri exhibition. Despite the relatively steep admission of 1,600 yen. It\u2019s not as well known as other exhibits in Tokyo \u2013 I was the only tourist visiting when I was there! While the exhibit is already over by now, I still recommend visiting\nHyakudan Kaidan\n.\nCeiling details at Hyakudan Kaidan in Hotel Gajoen\nHina Dolls at Hotel Gajoen Hinamatsuri Exhibition\nAnd even more places to visit\nSTILL looking for more places in Japan?

Planning a trip to Tokyo in October for my birthday. Couple of questions, you mentioned that you were an anime fan, do you know of any other museums or cool places to visit for anime? I\u2019m also a BIG Hello Kitty fan and wanted to visit Sanrio Puroland. What would be the best way to travel there and are there any other spots a Hello Kitty enthusiasts should go?\nThanks in advance for your help!\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nApril 8, 2024\nHey Trinette! I liked the Doraemon museum, especially if you\u2019re a fan of the manga (not just anime). I haven\u2019t been to Puroland but i imagine it would be a good place to go. Aside of that, look out for temporary exhibitions \u2013 when I went to Tokyo last time they had the Sailor Moon 30th anniversary exhibition which was really good for fans.\nReply\nKristin Saastad\nsays\nMarch 14, 2024\nHi Melissa,\nIm just planning a trip to Tokyo. Ive loved reading your recomendations and all the useful informations you have provided.\nIm still very confussed on what trein pass I should buy. WE are planning a couple of days in Kyoto so I thought the JR rail pass would be smart. But travelling in Tokyo I understand they onky run a few trains. Should i get the additional IC card?\nThank you\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nMarch 15, 2024\nHey Kristin, yes I do recommend the IC Card since Tokyo Metro is more prevalent in Tokyo. If you have an iPhone, you can easily use the virtual IC Card via the wallet app and don\u2019t need a physical IC Card. I have some tips here:\nhttps://girleatworld.net/virtual-ic-card-japan/\nIf not, you can try to get a physical IC Card when you\u2019re in Japan, but there is a shortage in Tokyo. I recommend seeing if you can get an ICOCA card in Osaka or Kyoto.\nReply\nAngela\nsays\nFebruary 29, 2024\nHi Melissa,\nThank you for this extensive list! The 16-piece breakfast sushi you ate at Tsukiji looks incredible \u2014 do you happen to remember where this was?\nThank you in advance!!\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nFebruary 29, 2024\nHey Angela, I honestly don\u2019t remember :/ I just went to a random place at Tsukiji! But If you\u2019re interested in a sushi platter like that, it\u2019s very common.\nReply\nZaza\nsays\nJanuary 31, 2024\nHi Melissa, your post is really an enlightening read and made me relook at my plan for the 100000th time.\nI\u2019d like your comment on my itinerary. I\u2019m travelling with my husband and 3 kids 7, 11 and 13yo this coming late Feb \u2013 early March.\nDay 1- Arrive in Tokyo at noon. Stay at Shinjuku. Visit Shinjuku Gyoen\nDay 2- Sanrio Puroland, Ikebukuro\nDay 3- Mt. Fuji, Lake Kawaguchiko with private tour\nDay 4- Travel to Osaka via JR Hokuriku Arch Pass (Tokyo-Kanazawa-Osaka). Arrive by noon. Start 1.5 days Universal Studios pass.\nDay 5- Whole day Universal Studios\nDay 6- Travel back to Tokyo via JR Hokuriku Arch Pass. Arrive around 3pm. Stay at Asakusa. Sunset at Tokyo Skytree.\nDay 7- Kimono experience to Sensoji Temple, UENO PARK & National Museum of Nature and Science\nDay 8- Tsukiji Fish Market, Teamlabs planet, Ginza\nDay 9- Travel back to KL\nWe\u2019re planning to get the Klook Greater Tokyo pass for most of the attractions, 72hr subway pass, and of course the 1.5 day USJ pass also from Klook.\nQuestion:\n1. Do I still need to purchase a Welcome Suica?\n2. I\u2019ve done the math and I found that it\u2019s cheaper to travel to Osaka and return to Tokyo via Hokuriku Arch Pass. But somehow i feel that we\u2019re wasting time on the train with super early morning timing and not making full use of the pass by not going to at least Nagano for some powder action, or at least a short sightseeing around Kanazawa. Is there, any options cheaper and faster (longshot question here)?. Have you ever gone this route?\nIt\u2019s our first time to Japan! I\u2019d really appreciate your insight. Thanks in advance!\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nJanuary 31, 2024\nHey Zaza\n1. You don\u2019t need a welcome suica if you have iPhone, bc you can just use the wallet app and add Suica there:\nhttps://girleatworld.net/virtual-ic-card-japan/\nBut if you dont use iPhone then yes you need suica card for the local travel within the city. Otherwise you\u2019ll have to get a ticket for each travel. For your kids i think they can get kids Suica card at the station, You should try that since kids travel for less.\n2. It is indeed a waste to not go to other parts of Japan, but given your itinerary is already packed, I am not sure how you\u2019ll be able to fit more in. You will have to sacrifice some time in Tokyo.\nReply\nInday\nsays\nJanuary 29, 2024\nHello Melissa,\nMy dad and I are visiting Japan for the first time. We are staying in Osaka because we are exploring mainly the Kansai region; however, we have an 8-hour layover in HND from about 5AM to 1:30PM on a Tuesday. What would you recommend us see or visit during our layover? Thank you!\nP.S. Thank you so much for your blog posts! I have only read the Osaka Itinerary one because so far that is only what I really need, but I am sure they are all helpful!\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nJanuary 29, 2024\nHey Inday, lucky Haneda is so close to the city! I would head to Tsukiji outer market for a sushi breakfast. Its only 30 mins by train. If you want the real fish market though, it\u2019s been moved to Toyosu which isnt too far from Tsukiji as well. After, if you still have time you can stroll around Ginza then head back to Haneda\nReply\nHelen McGahan\nsays\nJanuary 7, 2024\nThanks, Melissa for your amazing blog. We are going to Japan soon and will spend 4 nights in Tokyo, 2 nights in Kyoto and another 3 nights in Tokyo. Should we invest in a 7 day JR Pass or buy return bullet train tickets to Kyoto and use the local trains when in Tokyo? Your advice is greatly appreciated. We are really only there to eat! Thanks\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nJanuary 7, 2024\nHey, if you\u2019re only going to Tokyo and Kyoto then JR Pass is not worth it. Just get the return ticket and use IC card for the local trains.\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nOctober 22, 2023\nGreat informative blog Melissa!  I\u2019m going to Japan next month for the first time and this will be so helpful.  We will be in Tokyo for 4 days, staying in the Shinjuku area, so your tips will be perfect. My daughter is pescatarian so wondering if you have any more vegetarian tips for where to eat? Also, have you written any blogs about Kyoto?\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nOctober 22, 2023\nHello fellow Melissa! Yes I do I have a guide for Kyoto as well:\nhttps://girleatworld.net/kyoto-guide/\nYou can see all my posts about Japan here:\nhttps://girleatworld.net/category/destination/asia/japan/\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nOctober 22, 2023\nRe: vegetarian, unfortunately I am\nnot one so I only have the one restaurant I\u2019ve gone to (which is included in this blog post), However if my understanding of pescatarian is that she eats fish, then she would be fine in most restaurant. The most common animal product that I tell my vegetarian friends to watch out for is bonito, which are fish flakes and used in broth often. I assume your daughter will not have such issues?\nReply\nmarvs_travel\nsays\nOctober 16, 2023\nHi Melissa,\nThis is a great article that I might try to do on our first visit in Japan. I will be travelling with my wife and 2 kids and we\u2019ll add a 2 day in Disneyland/Disneysea. I was wondering if you stayed in one place during all your days. Which city would you suggest if we have to add our disneyland days? thanks!\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nOctober 16, 2023\nHi Marvs, I just stayed at my original accommodation. Disney is pretty easy to get to via a train, so I don\u2019t think you need to change.. I imagine it would be difficult to change accommodation with 2 kids. The best thing would be to stay at the Disney resort itself, but if you aren\u2019t keen then the next best thing is to stay close to Maihama station, which takes you to Disneyland. I\u2019ll add some recommended hotels in my\nDisneyland post\n\ud83d\ude42\nReply\nmarvs_travel\nsays\nOctober 17, 2023\nHi Melissa,\nThank you so much for the info. I\u2019ll read your Disneyland post to get more ideas. btw, I know I will be buying a lot of stuffs to take back home, but I would like to buy heavy on my last day. Which on the 5 days/location you suggest we do last so we can take a lot of shopping before we head back home? thanks!\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nOctober 17, 2023\nHey marvs, I would do either Day 4 (Shinjuku) or Day 5 since it is lighter in travel. Also, Ginza is a shopping district. The MUJI and Uniqlo store in Ginza is the flagship in Tokyo. So just depends what you want to get!\nReply\nLisa\nsays\nOctober 14, 2023\nThanks for all your great ideas \u2013 looking forward to our first time in Japan next spring.\nBy the way, they say on the teamLab website that \u201cplanets\u201d has been extended to the end of 2027 due to popular demand. \ud83d\ude42\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nOctober 14, 2023\nHey Lisa!

My round trip as airport is haneda. Thanks .\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nDecember 17, 2019\nSuica is normally good for local transport only. It cant be used on express trains so when you go to Hitachi, Nikko, Mount Fuji, etc you might need to get a separate train tickets for those. Take a look at JR Pass and see if it makes sense for you.\nReply\nDebbie\nsays\nNovember 17, 2019\nHii Mel,\nI really enjoyed reading your Japan itinerary.\nI will be flying to Japan in March2020 for the first time.. \ud83d\ude05\nQuestions to you:\n1. Our flight will be arrive 1am midnight, will it be any transportation to the hotel? (2 adults & 2 kids \u2013 9 & 13 years old) destination maybe to SHinagawa or Shimbashi ?\n2. My japanesse friend suggested to find a hotel somewhere Shimbashi or Shinagawa, do u think they are far away from the city ?\n3. We have 11 days in Japan, and i know the JR Pass is so expensive, do u think we should stay in Tokyo & surrounds (will go to Disneyland for sure )or should we go out of town ? Hiroshima etc..\n4. Money wise, should we get the travel money as well ? i heard they dont accept many Credit card.\nThanking you in advance \ud83d\ude18\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nNovember 17, 2019\n1. Which airport are you flying into? Haneda or Narita? In any case, you might need to pre-book a private transfer (I have a link above) since all trains would have stopped by then. It\u2019s worth it since you are traveling in a large group. From Haneda there are some late night buses:\nhttp://www.haneda-airport.jp/inter/en/access/bus.html\nbut they come very sporadically\n2. I have stayed in Shinagawa. It\u2019s convenient if you are close to Shinagawa station and if you are flying out of Haneda later on (only 20 mins by train). Shimbashi is also a great option as it is in the middle of most things.\n3. Most people do Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto so you should look into that for first time visit. I\u2019d save Hiroshima for a second visit. I have a blog post on Osaka and Kyoto too!\nhttps://girleatworld.net/osaka-itinerary-japan/\nIf you want to save on JR, then I\u2019d check out cities around Tokyo like Hakone (for a chance to view Mount Fuji) or Nikko (temples and UNESCO heritage area). You only need 5-7 days to explore Tokyo.\n4. Yeah certain places are cash only but if you stay within Tokyo, you\u2019ll find credit card accepted in most places (convenient store, hotes, etc). I\u2019d get some cash ready, probably about 2,000-3,000 yen per person per day. Definitely check your bank and options to withdraw ATM since you probably don\u2019t want to be traveling with that much money for 11 days.\nReply\nLauren\nsays\nNovember 12, 2019\nThe most helpful write-up I\u2019ve seen while researching for my trip.

For Ryokan, I don\u2019t know many in Tokyo itself but if you go to Hakone and Nikko, there are plenty. I have a little blurb on Hakone in this post. If you like quiet area, I suggest checking out Shimokitazawa or Daikanyama. They are quiet but still close enough to central Tokyo.\n2. It\u2019s not really necessary, Tokyo is so well connected that you won\u2019t have too much trouble with commute, as long as you stay near a train station. One might be more convenient than others but for a 5 day trip it shouldn\u2019t make too much difference.\nReply\nMaddy\nsays\nAugust 20, 2019\nHi there!\nI\u2019m traveling to Tokyo in about a week for a five day stay. I plan to follow the itinerary you posted as much as I can.\n1). What is the best way to get from Narita airport (terminal 3) to my hotel in Shinjuku?  Do I take the Keisei Skyliner, and transfer at Nippori for a local JR line train to Shinjuku Station? Should I buy a round-trip Keisei Skyliner ticket so that I can use this same way on my return to Narita at the end of my trip?\n2). I\u2019ll be in Tokyo for nearly my entire stay.  Is there a 5 day JR line pass I can buy?\nThanks in advance \ud83e\udd17\nMaddy\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nAugust 20, 2019\nHey Maddy,\n1. Keisei Skyliner is the cheapest way to get to city, so yes you can take it to Nippori then transfer to local line to Shinjuku (20 mins) The other option is Narita Express, which takes you to Tokyo station and you can take the local line to Shinjuku for shorter time (13 mins), but it costs more. I personally would take the Skyliner.\n2. If you are just staying in Tokyo, you don\u2019t need a JR Pass. Just buy the SUICA card for train transfers.\nReply\nMaddy\nsays\nAugust 22, 2019\nThanks for the tips.  I think I will use the Skyliner as you suggested.  Some follow-up questions:\n1). Should I buy this ahead of my trip and go to the Skyliner counter when I arrive for the actual pass? I hope the counter is open when I arrive around 6:30 am.\n2). Should I buy/book my return Skyliner ticket ahead of time?\n3). About the SUICA card, is it advisable to buy this at Narita airport upon my arrival or ahead of time?\n4).  Is there a 5-day SUICA pass or do I just top up as my balance runs low?\nThanks again!\nMaddy\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nAugust 22, 2019\nHey Maddy,\n1. Buying ahead of time is cheaper so do that if you can. A voucher will be emailed to you right away and you can redeem from Skyliner ticket counter when you reach Narita. However, the counter is only open from 7AM onward. Assuming you have to go through immigration etc then you might just get to the counter right when they open.\n2. That depends on your flexibility. I see the ticket is not sold as round trip package so you could just buy them later if you arent sure.\n3. You can do both. Buying ahead of time saves you a little bit of money\n4. I usually just top up as I go, I find this the easiest and fuss free. There are some passes that has unlimited pass, but as I mentioned in my post Japan runs on multiple different train companies, and the unlimited passes only work on certain lines.\nReply\nnisa\nsays\nJuly 29, 2019\nMelissa god bless you.

I love it and i love you! haha thanks alot.\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nJuly 29, 2019\nThank you for taking the time to leave this comment, Nisa!! Enjoy Japan\nReply\nIda\nsays\nJuly 28, 2019\nHi Melissa!\nGreetings from Denmark \u2013 we love your Tokyo guide and are very excited about going to Japan in about 3 weeks time.\nWe have one question regarding the JR pass which we can\u00b4t seem to figure out:\nWe are primarily staying in Tokyo for a few days but are then travelling TO Kyoto \u2013  and BACK when we catch the flight home. And PERHAPS we will do a day-trip outside Tokyo, depends.\nSo we a getting the SUICA card \u2013 but what about the JR pass, since it\u00b4s only back and forth between Tokyo and Kyoto and eventually 1-day trip???\nWhat do you recommend?\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nJuly 29, 2019\nHey Ida,\nA 7-day JR Pass costs about the same as regular round trip tickets for Tokyo \u2013 Kyoto, so its worth to get in my opinion. You can use it for the local JR trains too when you are in Tokyo and Kyoto, so it would save you some money instead of using SUICA balance. Each trip cost about 260-300 yen (depending on distance), and in my experience I use the train 3-4 times a day so that adds up to about 900-1200 yen a day. See this page for the price of Tokyo-Kyoto train:\nhttps://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2363.html\nIf you are in Japan longer than 7 days and you are getting the 7-day JR Pass, just make sure you don\u2019t activate / use the JR pass until 7 days before you get on the train back to Tokyo \u2013 basically you need the JR pass to still be active for when you go to Tokyo->Kyoto and Kyoto->Tokyo.\nHope that helps!!\nReply\nIda\nsays\nJuly 29, 2019\nTHANKS a lot! That was very helpful \u2013 we\u00b4ll purchase the JR tickets then and take care not to activate them too soon! \ud83d\ude00\nReply\nKathleen\nsays\nMay 20, 2019\nMy husband and I visited Japan in January 2019.  We are frequent travelers, but this was our first time there.  We found ourselves referencing your various travel itineraries repeatedly throughout our trip (including your Tokyo and Osaka itineraries).  Your transit tips were very helpful and we found we couldn\u2019t go wrong when following your food recommendations (including suggesting we check out danielfooddiary.com).  Definitely helped to make the trip amazing!  And we were really glad to see you back in Japan again recently as we\u2019re already planning a return trip and will definitely check out your updated info.  Thanks for the awesome tips!\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nMay 20, 2019\nthank you so much for your kind words Kathleen! comments like yours are what keeps me motivated to maintain this blog. thank you for taking the time to come back and write this \u2764\ufe0f\nReply\nMary\nsays\nMay 14, 2019\nHi, we are group of 5, will travel to narita by next week, and had a booking at narita airport hostel. Could you have any recommendations or suggestions for us.. which place is best to see near or around narita.  Its our first time to go to Japan and your blog was really helpful.\nThank you so much\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nMay 14, 2019\nHey Mary, glad to hear the post is helpful! Unfortunately, I am not familiar with Narita area. I hope you\u2019ll be going into the city?\nReply\nKhristian\nsays\nMay 25, 2019\nNarita San Temple and the awesome windy road that is directly Infront of the the temple is amazing to visit. Lots of shops and restaurants. I always go to this temple when I fly into Japan before heading out to Tokyo. The temple is very big and a local friend of mine said that\u2019s where his highschool graduation took place.\nReply\nHilda\nsays\nMay 7, 2019\nGreat post! And informative. If I may add something here, I would say it is definitely possible for you to buy Japan SIM at the airport \u2013 Mobal offers affordable phone plans and English support. I would also recommend visiting Shibamata, an old quarter where \u201cit\u2019s tough being a man\u201d was filmed \u2013 you need to change a lot of trains to get there if you are staying in central Tokyo or the West of Tokyo, but you may love the good and old days\u2019 ambience there.\nReply\nSasha\nsays\nApril 7, 2019\nHi Melissa! Great post. Very helpful as I\u2019ll be heading to Japan for 3 weeks later this month. We\u2019ve already purchased and picked up a 21-day JR pass, but I\u2019m wondering if we also have to purchase extra passes like the Hakone-Kamakura pass you mentioned? (Both of those places are on our itinerary) If so, where can these be purchased and does it have to be outside of Japan?\nThanks!\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nApril 7, 2019\nHey Sasha,\nThe JR pass can only cover the journey up to Odawara station, after which it switches to Odakyu line, which is why I recommend getting the Hakone pass as it offers discounts on the journey from Odawara to Hakone (or straight from Tokyo). I bought the pass in Japan, but it might be cheaper to buy through Klook link I have above. This pass does not have to be bought from outside of Japan.\nFind info about Hakone-Kamakura pass here\n\u2013 It has info about their office in Shinjuku\nReply\nAastha Sahni\nsays\nApril 7, 2019\nThis detailed post is very helpful. I am travelling from 9th until 21st April to Tokyo. My husband will be woking so I will be mostly on my own. Please recommend anything you want as i am going to stay for 2 weeks.\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nApril 8, 2019\nAastha, you are going to have so much fun! Perhaps you can look into day trips to nearby Tokyo, such as Hakone, Yokohama, and Kamakura. I also recommend exploring the lesser known neighborhoods such as Daikanyama, Nakameguro, Ebisu, and Shimokitazawa. I have a quick write up on Daikanyama here:\nhttps://girleatworld.net/daikanyama-tokyo-guide/\nYou can also look into Tokyo Disneyland trip if that\u2019s something that interests you.\nReply\nRichard\nsays\nMarch 27, 2019\nDoes the JR pass include the cities we are visiting..\nDor it includes Haneda airport to Chiba when we arrive from Bangkok..\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nMarch 27, 2019\nTokyo to Hamamatsu \u2013 Yes\nHamamatsu to Kyoto \u2013 Yes\nKyoto to Tokyo \u2013 Yes\nHaneda to Chiba you need to look it up yourself. I think it does not.\nReply\nRichard\nsays\nMarch 27, 2019\nfamily of 3 traveling from Tokyo to Hakone to Hammamatsu to Kyoto then back to Tokyo,  over 10 days.. is the JR pass feasible..?\nDoes JR pass cover transport from Haneda airport to hotel nearby Disney,  this is when we first arrive.. Thanks.. Richard\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nMarch 27, 2019\nHey Richard, it\u2019s hard to say since it depends on how long you plan to stay in Kyoto. In general, most of the savings of JR pass comes from the city to city bullet train so I feel it would be good for your Kyoto \u2013 Hamamatsu \u2013 Tokyo transfers, but you need to compare the actual price difference depending on your plan.\nReply\nRichard\nsays\nMarch 27, 2019\nDoes JR pass cover Tokyo to Hakone fare..\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nMarch 27, 2019\nHey Richard, I think it only covers part of the way. You can use your JR Pass to reach Odawara, then from there Hakone can be reached by private Odakyu line, which is not part of JR.\nReply\nvivian chin\nsays\nMarch 19, 2019\nHI, good day to you\nWe are 4 adult will be travelling to Tokyo this mid May 2019. my questions as below:-\nAny hotels receommand (transfer from Haneda Airport around 12am mid night to shinjuku bus terminal or Tokyo City Air Terminal for us with some luggages\nReply\nEyelett\nsays\nFebruary 26, 2019\nHi thank you for your post. Our family of four (kids 11 and 15) will be visitng Tokyo for the first time this coming May. We saw lots of affordable hotels in Ueno (3 min by foot from JR Ueno Station) that are new and spacious. Do you suggest this is a good base area for our 6 days? We are only planning to tour around Tokyo. I read somewhere that we might be wasting our time in transportation getting around the city (as opposed to staying in areas like Shinjuku, Tokyo Station or Shibuya.\nAlso for 6 days in Tokyo, can we just use Pasmo or Suica card in getting around the city? There is also a 3 day Tokyo city pass???\nThank you so much!\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nFebruary 26, 2019\nHey Eyelett, Ueno is not too bad \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind the 30 mins train ride to Shibuya and Shinjuku. Are you planning to spend many of your days there? There are things to see near Ueno too, like Akihabara and Asakusa.\nFor the 3 day pass, can you link me to the pass? You have to be careful bc sometimes they only include certain lines and does not include JR, which you\u2019ll want if you\u2019re staying near JR Ueno. If they don\u2019t include JR then you\u2019ll still need to pay with Pasmo/Suica. It\u2019s usually around 260-320 yen per ride.\nReply\nEyelett\nsays\nFebruary 26, 2019\nThank you Melissa,\nThe 3 day pass is for the Tokyo Metro Subway. I read the link here:\nhttps://jw-webmagazine.com/tokyo-subway-unlimited-pass-how-to-get-and-how-much-you-can-save-3ca0c6d36b84\nDo I need to get both JR Pass and Tokyo Metro Subway Pass? If so, I read that there are different kinds of JR Pass? I am only interested for the one to use in the city, or is the Metro Subway enough to get around?\nThank you!\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nFebruary 26, 2019\nHey Eyelett, that 3-day pass is only valid on Tokyo Metro and Toei lines. These are different than JR. That said, if you are planning to travel a lot by train in the first 3 days then I think it\u2019s still worth getting. Each ride on Toei/Metro line is usually 200 yen so to make it worth it you just need to ride it at least 3 times a day.\nThen, if you need to take a JR line then you can pay for it individually by either buying tickets each time at the ticket counter or use Suica.\nFor JR passes, these are only worth it if you are planning to get out of Tokyo since the savings are in the fact that you can take the longer ride bullet train between cities.\nReply\nAda Tash\nsays\nFebruary 23, 2019\nHi Melissa\nLove your post! Thanks so much \ud83d\ude42\nHave a few questions for you :\n1. Any suggested apps to download prior to trip?\n2. Based on your blog post, you suggested to buy these beforehand: 1) JR Pass 2) Suica pass 3) Prepaid Sim / Router\u2026 did I miss anything else?\n3. Did you go to Disneyland Tokyo during any of your trips? Any tips to share?\n4. If we arrive Haneda Airport late and trains may have stopped running by then, would taxi be the only option to get into Tokyo?\nThanks again! Look forward to hear back from you x\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nFebruary 23, 2019\nHey Ada\n1) Definitely download a google translate pack for Japanese, just in case\n2) yup, those should be good. I also suggest booking in advance if you want to visit Ghibli museum as they have limited tickets. And the Tokyo Disneyland ticket since you have to print those out in advance.\n3) Not yet \ud83d\ude41 It\u2019s still in my to-do list! I have heard you should just buy directly from the Disney website though since it allows direct entry and you won\u2019t have to pick up the ticket elsewhere. But you still have to print out the ticket no matter where you buy it from.\n4) There is a night bus from Haneda to certain areas of Tokyo, but the coverage is very limited \u2013\nclick here for more information\n. Aside of this yeah you have to take the taxi I suppose \u2013 it won\u2019t be cheap.\nReply\nAda Tash\nsays\nFebruary 25, 2019\nthanks melissa!\nReply\nAh Zul\nsays\nFebruary 17, 2019\nDear Melissa,\nThank you for your advise, I am first time to Tokyo for Rugby World Cup 2019 in October.\n1) For accommodation, any suggestion place to stay for 2 adults + 1 child?\n2) Can you suggest place to visit in Osaka? How many days require?\nBest regards,\nAh Zul\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nFebruary 17, 2019\nHi Ah Zul!\n1) Since you are a family, I would recommend looking through Airbnb for a one-bedroom apartment. This would be pretty small, but perfect for your family because you won\u2019t have to share. Just make sure it\u2019s close to a train station so you can get around easily.\n2) For osaka, I have an entire blog post on it!\nhttps://girleatworld.net/things-to-do-in-osaka/\nI recommend at least 3 days in Osaka.\nReply\nAutumnVibes\nsays\nFebruary 10, 2019\nHi!!

Happy birthday to the person celebrating. For daily allowance, I recommend having about $10-20 per meal and about $4-8 for transportation. As for 30th birthday recommendation, try walking around Daikanyama area (\nhttps://girleatworld.net/daikanyama-tokyo-guide/\n) there are lots of nice restaurants you can try there.

It\u2019s a great neighborhood and doesn\u2019t show up on many \u201cfirst time visitor\u201d itineraries. You always can tell the difference between an itinerary from someone who spent a few days in Tokyo and someone like you who has visited several times for work and holiday alike.\nOn your next visit to Tokyo, you might also enjoy Jimbocho. It receives even fewer visitors than Shimokitazawa, but likewise is a great place to explore.\nReply\nMelissa Hie\nsays\nMay 29, 2018\nThank you for stopping by! I feel Shimokita is getting more and more popular these days, I guess because it was featured in Vogue as one of Coolest Neighborhoods in the world. But yeah, it\u2019s definitely more low-key. I personally made it there due to a friend\u2019s recommendation and I ended up loving it so much that I had to include it here \ud83d\ude00\nDefinitely will keep Jimbocho in mind for my next Tokyo trip.

Give this a read to get a sense of what will help plan your Tokyo itinerary.\nConsider Booking Your Trip Over a Weekend\nMany of the places included below are best visited on the weekends. This itinerary can be done in any order, just be sure to confirm opening times as they may change seasonally. I\u2019ve pulled together day itineraries here in pockets of Tokyo to cut down on travel time.\nMake Sure Your Google Maps Are Downloaded Offline\nOne of the most helpful things you can do is to have your Google Maps downloaded offline for the Tokyo region. In addition to having Google Maps on your phone, there is a feature for offline maps that allows you to have the map accessible without data.\nPre-Purchase\nYour JR Rail Pass\nOdds are you will want a JR Rail Pass for your trip if you plan to do any hopping around, like Tokyo to Kyoto.\nYou have to apply and purchase\nyour JR Rail Pass\nprior to arrival in Japan\n. While in Tokyo you can use this JR pass for the JR Lines only across the city and it is even good for the Narita Express Line which takes you from Narita Airport into Shibuya/Shinjuku area.\nTo be eligible, you have to enter Japan as a temporary visitor (typical visa entry) and be sure to have the entry stamp on your passport. You\npurchase the JR Rail Pass\nprior to arriving in Japan, it is sent to your home, and then upon arrival, you go to a JR office (at most stations/airports) and exchange it for your pass.\nRead\nTransportation Tips for Japan\nfor a more in-depth guide on getting around Japan.\nGet a\nPrepaid SIM Card\nWi-Fi is your best friend in Tokyo and I highly recommend getting a\nPrepaid SIM Card\nbefore arrival. The last time I went, we had to do a more complicated SIM Card purchase at a 7/11 store, but now you can pre-purchase\nthis highly reviewed data card on Amazon\n(which is what I\u2019d do now).\nWhere to Stay in Tokyo\nI highly recommend basing yourself in\na single location\nfor your time in Tokyo. Switching accommodations can be a headache with the trains, so picking a home base is helpful. I recommend being based in either\nShinjuku\nor\nShibuya\n. When you pick your accommodations, make sure there is a train station within 10 minutes of walking distance \u2014 you\u2019ll use it a lot.\nThroughout my trips, I\u2019ve stayed at:\nBest Location ($):\nJR-East Hotel Mets Shibuya\nImage via Booking.com\nThere is absolutely nothing fancy about this hotel.\nHotel Mets\nis purely a logistic choice for accommodations and the location is one of the best. You\u2019re practically inside the Shibuya Train Station, making it very easy to explore Tokyo. The rooms are clean and simple, providing everything you need for a visit.\nBook the best rates here\n.\nAddress: 3 Chome-29-17 Shibuya, Shibuya City, Tokyo 150-0002, Japan\nBest Location ($$):\nShibuya Granbell Hotel\nImage via Booking.com\nI have stayed twice at the\nShibuya Granbell Hotel\n, one incredible location again inside the Shibuya Train Station. The rooms are a bit more elevated than the\nHotel Mets\nbut not by much. It\u2019s a great second option pending on which style you prefer.\nBook the best rates here\n.\nAddress: 15-17 Sakuragaokacho, Shibuya City, Tokyo 150-0031, Japan\nBest Apartment Rental ($$):\nDesigner Flat in Shibuya\nImage via Agoda.com\nOne of my favorite stays in Tokyo was this\nDesigner Flat in Shibuya\n. Sleek, cement walls in a modern building, this was a great stay. It was a bit further from the train station however, we had a more \u201cneighborhood\u201d experience which I personally enjoyed.\nBook the best rates here\n.\nOther Shibuya Hotels to Consider\nTRUNK HOTEL\n,\nfor an eco-chic stay\nHotel Emit\n,\nfor the best boutique hotel\nMustard Hotel\n,\nfor the best modern hotel\nDay 1: Yoyogi Park, Harajuku, & Omotesando/Aoyama\nYoyogi Park & Area\nThere is no better place to start your trip than\nYoyogi Park\n.\nIt is Tokyo\u2019s large green space and home to zen gardens and Shinto shrines. I find it really relaxing to stretch my legs out after a long travel day. Before entering the park, I\u2019d stop into\nCAMELBACK Sandwich & Espresso\nfor one of their creative sandwiches and grab a coffee to go. If they\u2019re not open yet, go to\nCoffee Supreme Tokyo\naround the corner.\nStroll up into the park, and make your way to\nMeiji Jingu\n, the stunning Shinto Shrine. You can partake in the water purification ritual, where you ladle water from the fountain into your hands to wash your mouth. As you walk out of the Meiji Torii gates towards Harajuku, don\u2019t forget to stop by the picturesque\nMeiji Jingue Consecrated Sake Barrels\n.\nHarajuku\nHarajuku is a whirlwind of a neighborhood. It really doesn\u2019t come to life until after 10 am, but when it does, it gets jammed packed. The famous\nTakeshita Dori\nstreet runs right through it and you\u2019ll start to see the crowds line up for various food shops. Pop into one of the famous Japanese crepe stores while here for a Tokyo classic.\nFor lunch, continue through the neighborhood to\nSakura-tei Restaurant\nwhere you can make your own okonomiyaki. These savory Japanese pancakes are my absolute favorite, made of cabbage and your protein of choice, and it\u2019s so fun to make it yourself. (make reservations.)\nOmotesando + Aoyama\nOmetesando is arguably the most upscale neighborhood in Tokyo. This is where you\u2019ll find all of your high-end shopping, boutiques, cafe, and restaurants. You can continue into Omotesando right from Harajuku. Stop at\nTokyu Plaza Omotesando Harajuku\nfor the famous escalator that is built with geometric mirrors (such a trip).\nThere are many stores in the neighborhood, like the famous\nAMORE Vintage\nfor vintage luxury handbags. I love going into\nB-Side Label\nfor all of the fun stickers you can collect. This whole neighborhood warrants 2-3 hours of just perusing. For caffeine needs, stop into the beautiful\nBlue bottle in Aoyama\nor\nCafe Kitsune.\nTo end the day, make your way to\nNezu Museum\nin Aoyama (open Tues-Sunday, 10 am to 5 pm). This is my favorite museum in all of Tokyo \u2014 the collection of pre-modern art and the gardens are wonderful. For dinner this night, pre-reserve the best tonkatsu meal in Tokyo at\nButagumi\n. It\u2019s a life-changing meal, and well worth the price.\nDay 2: Nakameguro, Shimokitazawa, & Shibuya\nNakameguro to Meguro\nIn the morning, hop on the train to Naka-Meguro Station. You\u2019ll pop out and walk over to\nOnibus Coffee\nfor one of the best cups of coffee in town, it\u2019s a peaceful start to the day. From there, make your way to the Meguro River which cuts through the scenic Meguro Neighborhood.\nIf you time it right, you\u2019ll be treated to the best cherry blossom trees around. (Direction:\nSakura Bridge\n.) This neighborhood is scenic and makes for just a good stroll and look around during the mid-morning to afternoon, I like to grab something quick at a 7/11 like Onigiri.\nShimokitazawa\nI\u2019ve included\nShimokitazawa\non this day as I find you\u2019ll go through Nakameguro and Meguro quite quickly and Shimokitazawa is almost always a bit out of the way to get to anyways. From Nakameguro, it is most convenient to go by car or consider the train which is 1 switch.\nOnce in Shimokitazawa, I love how quaint and local this neighborhood feels. A few favorites from our past trips have been\nBear Pond Espresso\nfor coffee to start our time. Afterward, I love to stroll through the main shopping area called Shimokitazawa Ichibangai Shopping Street which is pedestrian-only (right out of the train station). And do make sure to stop into\nFog Linen Work\nfor the best home goods store around!\nShibuya\nLate afternoon into evening, head to Shibuya for the bustle of Tokyo city life. It\u2019s so much fun to be here for sunset and into the evening as the lights come on and the city bursts with life. You\u2019ll want to see the famous\nShibuya Scramble Crossing\n, where hundreds of people cross at the same time.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a view, the newest observation deck to open in Tokyo is the\nShibuya SKY Observation Deck\n, which could be worth adding to the itinerary if you have time. Shibuya is also known for shopping. My must-see store is always\nShibuya Loft\n.\nFor dinner, there are a few choices. The first is to stay right in the area and get soba noodles at\nSagatani Shibuya Dogenzaka\n. You use a vending machine to purchase your meal choice (ask for help) and they make your noodles right there. It\u2019s in Dogenzaka which is a bustling neighborhood for ramen, gyoza, bars, and nightlife.\nIf I were to pick, I would head up to\nFUKU Yakitori\nfor the best meal (in my opinion) in Tokyo. It\u2019s a traditional yakitori-style meal that you\u2019ll need your accommodations to call in to reserve (trust me). I\u2019ve eaten here about a half dozen times. I start and end every Japan trip with a meal here.\nDay 3: Tsukiji Fish Market, teamLab Planets, & Ramen\nTsukiji Outer Market\nThe early bird gets the worm here or in this case the best tuna. If you\u2019re looking to watch the tuna auctions, you need to go to the new Toyosu Market (I haven\u2019t been, really for only watching the auctions at 5 am). But if you\u2019re not doing that, the Tsukiji market is where it\u2019s at (train to Tsukiji Station).\nYou\u2019ll stroll through the markets, shopping for various items from food to cookware. The thing to do here is to eat sushi for breakfast \u2014 there are several famous stalls, but my favorite is\nSushizanmai Main Branch\n. It\u2019s a bit hard to find but use Google Maps to find this dozen-seat sushi bar tucked inside for a set menu.\nIf it\u2019s too busy, really most sushi stalls will be just fine. I\u2019d allot 2 hours or so to peruse around here.\nVisit teamLab Planets\nOne of my favorite things was visiting teamLab\u2019s exhibit and it\u2019s not terribly hard to get to from Tsukiji. The current exhibit open is\nteamLab Planets\n, and you\u2019ll need tickets to get in. As of now, the exhibit is set to be open through 2023, and try to avoid peak hours for a visit.\nGet tickets here\n.\nLate Ramen Lunch\nOne of our favorite meals in Tokyo is to go for ramen. There are so many spots to choose from and we typically do this the same day as our morning at Tsukiji. You could head into Ginza which is close by to Tsukiji, and our favorite there is\nHashigo Ginza Hon-Ten\n. It will put you in the Ginza neighborhood which is great for a stroll.\nIf you\u2019re open to going further,\nRamen Jiro Mita Honten\nhas been a regular pilgrimage for us. Their hopping bowls of ramen topped with garlic in fatty pork broth are a favorite. The lines are always long, so make sure to get there at least an hour before closing. We\u2019ve never found much to do afterward, but you could go up to Tokyo Tower afterward.\nDay 4: Shinjuku & Beyond\nShinjuku\nThere is so much to do in Shinjuku, one of the major hubs in Tokyo for business and dining. When you go is up to you, some like to start in the afternoon and stay through the night. One of my first stops is always\nOmoide Yokocho\n,\na small alley with several izakaya stalls for food.\nAnother thing to see in Shinjuku is to see the\nShinjuku Gyoen National Garden\n, great for Sakura season as well. It has 144 acres of botanical gardens, so you could block out an hour or two here.\nCome nighttime, the action is all in\nShinjuku\u2019s Golden Gai\n. Four blocks of narrow alleys are filled with bars, pubs, and taverns. It\u2019s a bit wild come night, so be mindful when you visit.\nDay 5: Take a Day Trip\nThere are several wonderful day trips to consider from Tokyo which is quite easy as the trains are so well connected. On the final day, you could consider taking one or add a few things from the bottom list. I always leave the final day to be open pending what we want to do.\nSome popular day trips:\nHakone\n,\nfor the lake, museums, and nature (1.5-2 hours)\nOdawara Castle\n(40 minutes)\nNikko National Park\n,\nfor time in nature (2 hours)\nKawagoe\n,\nfor traditional Edo-period town (1 hour)\nOther Things to Consider Adding to Your Itinerary\nAkihabara\n,\nfor all the famous arcade game stores, cat cafes, and more.\nAsakusa\n,\nfor cheap eats\nSens\u014d-ji\n,\nfor Tokyo\u2019s oldest temple\nUeno Park\n,\nfor a beautiful green park\nImperial Palace\n,\nfor scenic gardens and residence of the emperor of Japan\nMore Helpful Japan Posts\nThe Ultimate Two Weeks in Japan Itinerary: Where to Visit\nTop Tips Before Visiting Japan\nThe Alternative Guide to Tokyo\nVisiting the Kiso Valley\nThe Ultimate Guide to Kyoto\n20 Best Restaurants in Kyoto\nSave This Post for Later on Pinterest\nPS \u2014 Are You Booking a Trip Soon?

The city itself is home to more than 13 million people, and its metropolitan area houses more than 37 million. The area is 2,194 km\u00b2, which is almost double the size of New York City. There\u2019s nothing else on earth like it.\nMy husband and I have spent a collective 12 weeks in the city and are considering moving there, so have explored the dynamic metropolis extensively, uncovering its hidden gems and savoring its diverse culinary delights.\nIn this comprehensive 5-day itinerary, I'll share my insights and recommendations to help you make the most of your visit. This is geared toward first-time visitors who have never seen the city, but there are many gems that even a Tokyo veteran would enjoy.\nIf you\u2019re looking for\nwhat to book ahead of time in Tokyo\n, or\nwhere to stay, including neighborhoods and hotels\n, check out my other blog posts.\n5-Day Tokyo Itinerary Overview\nDay 1:\nShinjuku, Meiji Shrine, Harajuku, Shibuya\nDay 2:\nUeno, Kitchen Street, Asakusa, Tokyo Skytree\nDay 3:\nJapanese Gardens, Imperial Palace, Ginza, Akihabara\nDay 4:\nToyosu or Tsukiji Fish Market, Odaiba, Teamlabs Planets, Tokyo Tower\nDay 5:\nOption 1: Chic boutiques and cafes: Nakameguro, Daikanyama, and Ebisu\nOption 2: Upscale Art & Architecture: Aoyama, Omotesando, Azabudai Hills, Art Museums\nOption 3: Day trip to Hakone & Mt. Fuji\nDay 1: Shinjuku, Meiji Shrine, Harajuku, Shibuya\n9am: Explore Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden\nStart your morning with a leisurely stroll through\nShinjuku Gyoen National Garden\n, enjoying the peaceful park, secluded from the bustle of the city. During cherry blossom season, this is one of the best places to see cherry blossoms in all of Tokyo.\nShinjuku is primarily a night-time area, so be sure to make a trip back to see it at night.\n11am: Meiji Shrine & Yoyogi Park\nMake your way from the garden to the\nMeiji Jingu\n, a Shinto shrine that hosts various cultural events and ceremonies, including traditional Shinto weddings, seasonal festivals, and performances of traditional music and dance. Almost every time we\u2019ve visited we\u2019ve seen something going on.\nFrom there, continue to walk south, through Yoyogi Park to Harajuku.\n12pm: Harajuku\nHarajuku and Shibuya are possibly the two most crowded places in Tokyo, so prepare yourself.\nEnjoy lunch or afternoon tea in Harajuku, home to many of Tokyo\u2019s pet cafes. This area used to be full of men and women dressed in cosplay, anime characters, and maid outfits, but that edgy sub-culture has given way to a more commercial feel. Nevertheless, the famous (and crowded) Takeshita-Dori is lined with rainbow-colored, \u201ckawaii\u201d (Japanese for \u201ccute\u201d) foods. Highlights include\nLe Shiner\u2019s\nRainbow Cheese Sandwich,\nTotti Candy Factory\u2019s\nrainbow cotton candy, and\nMarion Cr\u00eapes\u2019\ncrepes, which are a staple of Harajuku street food culture.\nFor a fun and flavorful exploration of Harajuku, I recommend this\nCrazy Cute & Kawaii Food Tour\n,\nwhich includes 5 distinct stops in the neighborhood.\nIf bright-colored foods and animal cafes aren\u2019t your vibe, head over to\nCat Street\n, a winding street half a mile long that is lined with clothing shops. If you\u2019re not in the mood to shop today, you can come back to it on Day 5, if you\u2019re in the Omotesando area again.\nFrom here, make your way south to Shibuya.\n3pm: Shibuya\nIf you\u2019re reading this far enough in advance, I\u2019d highly recommend you get sunset time tickets for\nShibuya Sky\n(\nbook on Klook\n), an open-air observation deck at approximately 230 meters above ground. A spot 1-2 hours before sunset will allow you to go up, explore a little, then see the city transform from daylight to golden hour to dusk to blue hour, and it\u2019s a truly magical transformation. If you take a lot of photos, I\u2019d recommend you go 2 hours ahead. We entered around 4pm for a 6:10pm sunset and felt like the timing was perfect. If you just want to enjoy it, you can enter later, though those tickets might be even more difficult to book.\nRead more about what and how to book ahead of time\n.\nBefore your entry, experience the world-famous\nShibuya scramble crossing\n, where you\u2019re bound to see many cameras and GoPros capturing the sight of hundreds of people crossing over the zebra lines. Then make your way to the famous\nHachiko statue\n, a symbol of unwavering loyalty and now a popular gathering point. This statue honors a dog who, in the 1920s, would journey to Shibuya Station to wait for his owner to arrive back from his daily commute. One day his owner did not return from work, having suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. But the faithful pup returned to the station just as before, to wait for his owner every day until his own death nearly 10 years later.\nShibuya Stores worth visiting:\nTower Records:\nThis is one of the largest and most iconic music stores in the world, offering an extensive selection of vinyl records, CD\u2019s, DVD\u2019s, and music-related merch. The store often hosts live performances and events, and also has a cafe and bookstore for you to relax in.\nd47 Museum\n: The d47 Museum in Shibuya Hikarie showcases unique regional crafts, design, and culture from all 47 prefectures of Japan, offering an insightful glimpse into the nation\u2019s diverse heritage. The exhibits are thoughtfully curated, changing regularly to highlight different aspects of Japanese craftsmanship and innovation.\nMiyashita Park\n:\nThis shopping and dining complex with a rooftop park offers plenty of unique restaurants, cafes, and stores. It\u2019s an ideal spot to experience Tokyo\u2019s innovative approach to urban redevelopment and lifestyle.\nShibuya 109:\nShibuya 109 is a famous shopping mall known for its cutting-edge fashion boutiques, catering to Tokyo's trendy youth culture and fashion-forward shoppers. The multi-story complex is a hotspot for discovering the latest in Japanese street fashion and pop culture.\n6pm: Shinjuku\nFor dinner, head back to where you started the day, Shinjuku, for some of the best photos of futuristic neon signs and nightlife. There are thousands of places to eat in Tokyo, and most of them are very good, with tiny hidden restaurants everywhere.\nTwo very classically Japanese alleys in Shinjuku are\nOmoide Yokocho\n(Memory Lane)\n, an alleyway near Shinjuku Station lined with small, traditional eateries and izakayas, and\nGolden Gai\n, which is similar to Omoide Yokocho but more bars than restaurants. Both are amazing to walk through, though, so I\u2019d recommend you at least visit both.\nShinjuku also has many of Tokyo\u2019s (and the world\u2019s) best bars.\nShinjuku bars worth visiting:\nBar Benfiddich\n: Owner and head bartender Hiroyasu Kayama is basically a scientist in his rustic, cozy, apothecary-like lab. They focus on handcrafted cocktails and herbal infusions, and are currently #37 on The World\u2019s Best Bars list.\nArt Bar Shuten-Doji\n: Art Bar Shuten-Doji offers cocktails inspired by Japanese folklore and mythology, with a focus on artistic presentation and unique flavor combinations. The ambiance is eclectic and vibrant, often featuring rotating art exhibitions and installations that add to the bar\u2019s dynamic atmosphere.\n[temporarily closed]\nNew York Bar at the Park Hyatt\n: Famously known for its stunning panoramic views of Tokyo\u2019s skyline, this bar has live jazz performances and was made famous by the Hollywood movie, \u201cLost in Translation.\u201d Unfortunately, it is undergoing renovations and closed, due to reopen in October 2025.\nIf you want to make a whole night of it, here is a\nwalking route\nof 9 bars in Shinjuku worth visiting.\nDay 2: Ueno, Kitchen Street, Asakusa, Tokyo Skytree\n9am: Ueno\nStart your day at\nUeno Park\n, a beautiful and expansive park with several museums and a zoo. Spend some time walking around the park, visiting the serene Shinobazu Pond, and optionally exploring\nUeno Zoo\nif you\u2019re interested in seeing a variety of animals, including pandas.\nIf you\u2019re interested in Japanese art and history, the\nTokyo National Museum\nwithin Ueno Park is worth a visit. Allocate about an hour to explore its extensive collection of artifacts.\n11am: Ameya-Yokocho (Ameyoko) Market\nHead to Ameya-Yokocho, a bustling market street near Ueno Station. Browse the various stalls selling everything from fresh seafood to clothing and souvenirs. This is a great place to sample classic Japanese street food like takoyaki (octopus balls), yakitori (grilled chicken skewers), or taiyaki (fish-shaped pastries filled with sweet red bean paste).\n12:30pm: Kitchen Street\nKappabashi is one of the most Japanese-esque shopping experiences you can have. Where else in the world can you find food turned into plastic displays for restaurants as you can here?\n1:30pm: Asakusa\nAfter lunch, head to Asakusa and visit\nSenso-ji\n, Tokyo\u2019s oldest and most significant Buddhist temple. Enter through the iconic Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate) and stroll along Nakamise-dori, a shopping street leading up to the temple, where you can buy traditional snacks and souvenirs.\nFor panoramic views of Asakusa and a quick stop for some cultural insights, visit\nAsakusa Culture and Tourist Information Center\nright across from the Kaminarimon gate. The observation deck offers great views of Senso-ji and Tokyo Skytree.\nFor a quick dessert break, make your way to\nChacha Futatsume\nfor the Insta-famous matcha dessert.\n4pm: Tokyo Skytree\nMake your way to Tokyo Skytree, the tallest structure in Japan. Visit the Tembo Deck and Tembo Galleria for breathtaking 360-degree views of Tokyo. Spend some time exploring the shops and attractions in the Tokyo Solamachi mall at the base of Skytree.\nIf you have extra time, the\nSumida Aquarium\nlocated in Tokyo Solamachi is a fascinating place to visit, featuring beautiful aquatic displays and a unique penguin exhibit.\n6pm: Dinner in Asakusa\nReturn to Asakusa for dinner. For a traditional Japanese dining experience, try\nAsakusa Imahan\nfor delicious sukiyaki (thinly sliced beef cooked in a hot pot). Alternatively, if you prefer thick beef cutlets,\nAsakusa Gyukatsu\nis very well-rated beef katsu.\n8pm: Evening Stroll\nAfter dinner, take a relaxing stroll along the Sumida River at\nSumida Park\n, enjoying the beautiful night views of Tokyo Skytree illuminated against the night sky.\nFor a more lively evening, head to\nHoppy Street (Hoppy Dori)\nin Asakusa, where you can enjoy \u201cHoppy drink,\u201d a beverage that tastes like beer, but with a lower alcohol content (around 0.8%). You can also find it here mixed with shochu or other spirits. The street is lined with izakayas, and it\u2019s a great time.\nDay 3: Japanese Gardens, Imperial Palace, Ginza, Akihabara\n10am - 12pm: Imperial Palace & Gardens\nWe\u2019ve started every day in a large park, and today is no exception. The\nImperial Palace\nand its surrounding gardens are some of the most beautiful and grand in Tokyo.

Many stores, including Muji and Uniqlo, have their flagships here, alongside many luxury labels, and stationary stores. Many of Tokyo\u2019s best sushi spots can also be found here, though there are also plenty of other restaurants and cafes that are perfect for an afternoon break. If you\u2019re interested in discovering local hidden bars and izakaya in the area, come back at 6pm for\nthis tour\n.\nIf you\u2019re into the arts, you can also check out Ginza\u2019s\nkabuki theater\n, a reconstruction of the original theater site (originally built in 1889) which stages regular kabuki drama performances.\nShops in Ginza to Visit\nItoya\n: Stationery paradise\nGinza 6\n: great rooftop views\nMuji\n: Flagship\nUniqlo\n: Flagship, but skip it if you\u2019re there in the afternoon as it will be crazy busy/crowded, and the fitting room lines are long and you can only try on 5 items at a time.\n3pm - 6pm: Akihabara\nAlso known as \u201cElectric Town,\u201d Akihabara is a vibrant district in Tokyo known for its bustling streets filled with electronics shops, anime and manga stores, and pop culture attractions. Originally famous for its abundance of electronics retailers, Akihabara has evolved into a cultural hub for otaku (geek) culture, attracting fans of anime, manga, video games, and idol groups from around the world.\nAnime and manga enthusiasts should definitely explore the\nMandarake Complex\n, an eight-story building that specializes in anime, manga, and collectible toys, or\nSuper Potato\n, a retro gaming paradise famous for its vast selection of retro video games, consoles, and merch, or\nRadio Kaikan\n, which sells electronics, hobby items, and anime merchandise.\nIf those don\u2019t interest you, I\u2019d recommend popping into\nDon Quijote\n, a popular discount chain store that is a scene unto itself, or\nYodobashi Camera\n, one of the largest electronics stores in Japan, where you can find everything from cameras and computers, to household appliances, toys and games.\nIf you have a driving license, book a\nStreet Go-Karting experience\n, for which\nAkihabara is well known, although you can also do this in\nShibuya\n, or\nAsakusa\n.\nFor a slower end to the day, head to\nmAAch ecute\nor\n2k540 Aki-Oka Artisan\n, two great shopping areas that offer a mix of independent boutiques, cafes, and a craft beer brewery.\nSleep early tonight so you can have an early start the next day, to see the famous fish markets of Tokyo.\nDay 4: Toyosu or Tsukiji Fish Market, Odaiba, Teamlabs Planets, Tokyo Tower\n5:30am Toyosu Fish Market Auction\nIf you\u2019re interested in watching the famous Tuna Auction, it has moved from Tsukiji fish market to\nToyosu\n. There are two ways to watch the auction (which starts at 5:30am). The first is through a lottery system (they changed the auction from being first-come-first-serve because the lines got absurdly long and started at 2am), which you can apply for\nhere\n. The other is through a public observation deck that you can go to if you win the lottery, but is higher up and more crowded. For more,\nthis blog post\nis a helpful guide. If you can, I would definitely recommend entering the lottery and trying to watch the auction.\n7am Toyosu\nOnce the auction finishes, you\u2019re free to wander around the site. There are lots of shops where chefs shop wasabi, dashi, and other produce that you are free to buy from, as well as restaurants that serve fresh seafood.\nIf you want to see where the fish is sold, though, that part of the building is only accessible with a guide, so I\u2019d recommend this\nTuna Auction & Toyosu Market Tour\n, which will pick you up from your hotel, and then guide you through the auction and the market.\nIf you don\u2019t care to see the auction or Toyosu, you can explore the Tsukiji Outer Market, instead. If you want to do both, I\u2019d recommend this\nToyosu & Tsukiji Market Tour and Sushi Workshop\nwhich begins with a walk around the fish markets, where you will purchase tuna, watch it cut into individual portions (a special job that even young sushi chefs are not allowed to do), then make sushi yourself.\n9am Odaiba\nOnce you\u2019ve eaten yourself full of fresh fish, head over to Odaiba, a man-made island in Tokyo Bay that was originally built for defense, but rebuilt in the early 1990s to showcase futuristic living.\nBesides TeamLab Planets, which you should definitely visit (details below), here are some spots in Odaiba to enjoy:\nOdaiba Seaside Park (Odaiba Kaihin Koen):\nEnjoy a leisurely walk along the beach, rent a paddle boat, or simply relax and take in the views. The park is also an excellent spot for watching the sunset over the bay. The views here include Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo\u2019s own Statue of Liberty.\nDiverCity Tokyo Plaza:\nA large shopping and entertainment complex behind the enormous Unicorn Gundam statue. Inside, you'll find a range of stores from high-end brands to Japanese fashion, along with themed cafes and the Gundam Base Tokyo, dedicated to Gundam models and merchandise.\nMiraikan Museum (National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation):\nMiraikan is a museum that focuses on the latest advancements in science and technology, including hands-on exhibits related to space exploration, robotics, and environmental science.\nPanasonic Center Tokyo:\nThis center features interactive exhibits on cutting-edge technology, sustainable living solutions, and the future of home electronics. It also hosts various events and workshops. If you\u2019re interested in seeing how this Japanese company is changing the game, this stop is for you.\nFuji Broadcasting Center\n: This distinctive building has a spherical observation room on the 25th floor of Fuji\u2019s Headquarters.\u00a0Inside the building, you can also visit television sets and a rooftop garden.\nTokyo Joypolis\n: This gaming arcade features both traditional arcade games and some of the world\u2019s most advanced virtual reality games.\n4pm TeamLab Planets\nI was worried before going that\nTeamLab Planets\n(\nbuy tickets\n) would be boring as its been Instagrammed to death, but it was quite the opposite. I loved the interactive art and would highly recommend anyone going to Tokyo to get tickets for this exhibit. If you can\u2019t get tickets for the first opening to get in before everyone else, I\u2019d recommend going later in the evening and on a weekday. It gets pretty busy, but if you\u2019re patient enough, you can get photos without people in them. Video is a bit harder.\nIf you\u2019ve been to TeamLab Planets, you can go instead to\nTeamLab Borderless\n, which recently relocated to Azabudai Hills (\nbuy tickets\n).\nDay 5\n5 days is barely enough to scratch the surface of Tokyo, but here are some options for your last day. If you\u2019re doing 7 days in Tokyo, I would make these days 5, 6, and 7.\nOption 1: Nakameguro, Daikanyama, and Ebisu\nSome of the cutest areas in Tokyo, these three neighborhoods are a little further Southwest and very trendy.\n10am Nakameguro\nStart your morning at the\nNakameguro Starbucks Reserve\n, which has floor to ceiling windows for 4 floors, and a huge open roasting operation. It opened in 2019 and is one of the biggest Starbucks in the world. They have all sorts of special merch, a matcha/tea corner, specialty drinks, and beautifully decorated walls. It does gets super busy, though, especially if you go during cherry blossom season, so be prepared to wait a bit for drinks and seating.\nAfter you\u2019ve gotten your caffeine and maybe pastry fill, walk along the\nMeguro River\n, one of Japan\u2019s most famous cherry blossom spots. The cherry trees were cut this year so they didn\u2019t bloom as fully over the River, but it was still stunning to see them in full bloom. If you go during the cherry blossom season, though, brace yourself because it does get quite crowded. It might make more sense (if you go during this time) to go earlier and take photos of the blossoms first, then make your way to the Starbucks for a post-shoot snack.\n2pm Daikanyama\nThe Daikanyama area is where we originally considered moving to, and has many craft breweries and independent coffee roasteries. The streets there are lined with boutiques and cute shops, and there\u2019s really great vintage shopping in the area. The only reason we decided we probably would not move there is because it\u2019s a little far from the rest of Tokyo \u2014 Nakameguro is slightly better connected.\n5pm Ebisu\nIn the evening, make your way to Ebisu, the most expat-friendly of the three areas. Many foreigners choose to live here, in a \u201cmore suburban\u201d area of Tokyo, and the whole area is full of Japanese and Western cuisine.\nOption 2: Upscale Art & Architecture: Aoyama, Omotesando Azabudai Hills, Art Museums\n10am: Aoyama Farmers Market\nOn Saturdays and Sundays, there is a farmers market at UNU (United Nations University), and it\u00a0is one of Tokyo\u2019s longest running and best-attended markets. Organic and local fare is readily available from 10am to 4pm, and the stalls change periodically. We went twice in the span of 3 weeks and saw a 30-50% change in the stalls. I would recommend eating a small brunch here, at one of the food trucks, or in the various cafes nearby, notably\nPierre Herm\u00e9\nor\nGotran Cherrier\n.\n11am: Nezu Museum\nFrom there, make your way to Nezu Museum, where you can explore the musem\u2019s impressive collection of East Asian art and the beautiful Japanese garden. The architecture by Kengo Kuma is also a highlight. This is also the start of a street with high-end boutiques and sophisticated architecture.\n12:30pm: Aoyama\nIf you\u2019re hungry after the museum, a great lunch option nearby is\nAoyama Flower Market Tea House\n, where you can enjoy tea and a meal in a green house, surrounded by flowers.\nOtherwise, follow the large street from Nezu Museum toward Omotesando, and you will hit many shopping and architecutre highlights including\nGentle Monster\n,\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons\n, and\nPrada\n. If you\u2019re just taking photos, the street will probably take about 30 minutes to walk. If you\u2019re shopping, I\u2019d allocate more time.\n2pm: Omotesando Hills\nSpend an hour and a half exploring this architectural gem designed by Tadao Ando. Enjoy some high-end shopping, admire the sleek interior design, and perhaps grab a coffee at one of the chic cafes. I love how Tokyo has all these amazing buildings built on very strange lots of land.\nThen, if you have more time and interest, you can also briefly visit the\nWatari Art Museum\n, a contemporary art museum designed by Mario Botta, which is not too far away.\n4pm: Azabudai Hills\nHead over to this new development area which features stunning modern architecture and design. Spend around 2 hours exploring the upscale shops, eateries, and public spaces. Enjoy the unique blend of greenery and urban design. This is also where the new Aman sister property,\nJanu\n, is located.\n6pm: Roppongi\nEvery day but Tuesday,\nMori Art museum\nis open until 10pm, and has an amazing, rotating exhibition of international contemporary work. Don\u2019t miss the\nTokyo City View\nobservation deck for stunning views of the city at sunset and nightfall.\nChoose from a variety of upscale dining options in Roppongi Hills or nearby, such as\nL\u2019Atelier de Joel Robuchon\n(French) or\nUkai-tei Roppongi\n(teppanyaki).\n9pm: Visit a Bar\nIf you have energy left, take a leisurely stroll around the Roppongi area to enjoy the nightlife and illuminated cityscape. Alternatively, visit a bar in the area, like\nAyano\u2019s Bar\n,\nMogambo Tokyo\n, or\nBar as ONE Roppongi\n.\nOption 3: Day trip to Hakone & Mt. Fuji\nThe easiest way to do this day trip is on a tour, with a guide to tell you all about what you\u2019re seeing. This\nextremely well-rated tour\nis a great option \u2014 they take you to the 5th Station of Mt. Fuji by deluxe coach, then you enjoy a Japanese Garden, lunch buffet, and Owakudani Valley, before riding a sky gondola and a Lake Ashi cruise. All of this with an English-speaking guide and bullet train return to Tokyo. You can also do it on a 10-hour\nPrivate Tour\n, which I personally prefer.\nAnother optional day trip is a visit to\nYokohama\n, where you can see Minato Mirai 21, a futuristic waterfront area featuring the Landmark Tower with its Sky Garden observation deck for panoramic city views, visit the Cup Noodles Museum, where you can create your custom cup of noodles and learn about the history of this iconic food (book ahead), and explore Yokohama Chinatown, the largest in Japan. There\u2019s also Sankeien Garden, Yamashita Park, and Yokohama Museum of Art. This day trip is easier to do on your own, but if you\u2019d rather do a tour, you can take a train to Yokohama and then join\nthis private 8hr tour\n.\nTravel\nJapan\nAsia\nJanice Rohrssen\nPrevious\nPrevious\nWhere to Stay & Best Hotels // Barcelona, Spain\nNext\nNext\nWhere to Stay & Best Hotels // Tokyo, Japan"}]}

It\u2019s fast-paced, futuristic, and bursting with weird and wonderful activities to keep you busy, including gorgeous shrines, palaces, and temples; hip clubs and bars; and fashionable people and shopping, not to mention beautiful cherry blossoms.\nTokyo lives up to all the hype. If I could spend months living there, I would.\nYou never know what you\u2019ll find here. One second you\u2019ll run into a group of women dressed in pig masks and \u201980s dresses and the next you\u2019re in a robot caf\u00e9 or a centuries-old temple.\nIt\u2019s also one of the biggest cities in the world, home to almost 14 million people (almost 40 million if you count the metropolitan area). Not surprisingly, there are many nooks and crannies to explore in this city that seamlessly weave centuries-old Japanese traditions with modern technology. (So don\u2019t rush your visit. You\u2019re never going to see it all anyway, so don\u2019t try!)\nTo help you plan your trip, here is my suggested itinerary based on over seven visits to Tokyo:\nTokyo Itinerary Highlights\nDay 1\n:\nFish Market, Imperial Palace, Harajuku, & more!\nDay 2\n:\nAsakusa, Ueno Park, Sento, & more!\nDay 3\n:\nShinjuku, Shibuya, Quirky Cafes, & more!\nDay 4\n:\nTake a Day Trip\nDay 5\n:\nSumo, Samurai, Meguro River, & more!\nTokyo Itinerary: Day 1\n(\nNote:\nThere\u2019s a lot listed for this day. Since you\u2019re likely to wake up super early because of jet lag, you can fit it all in. You might not want to, though. Maybe you need an afternoon nap!)\nRoam the Tsukiji and Toyosu Fish Markets\nIn 2018, Tokyo\u2019s main fish market moved to Toyosu, which is twice the size of the old one, Tsukiji, making it the largest in the world. While a lot of good restaurants moved too (Sushi Dai being the most famous), I find the place itself very stale, since you can no longer wander the floor (you look down via a walkway above; you also need a visitor\u2019s pass to enter).\nThe old outer market in Tsukiji is still great though, and you can still find food and stores there too. You can wander alone and just eat and shop until you can\u2019t anymore! Most businesses open at 6am, so it\u2019s a perfect place to go in the morning when you wake up early because of jet lag.\nFood and drink tours of the Tsukiji Outer Market\nare available for around 13,500 JPY.\nTsukiji Fish Market: 5 Chome-2-1 Tsukiji, Chuo, +81 3-3542-1111. Admission is free. Toyosu Fish Market: 6 Chome-6-2 Toyosu, Koto, +81 3-3520-8205. Open Monday-Saturday 5am-5pm, though most businesses don\u2019t open until 7am. Admission is free.\nImmerse yourself at teamLab Planets\nThis really fun and quirky digital art installation is a multisensory and immersive experience in which you become part of the artwork, walking barefoot through the four exhibition spaces and gardens as you interact with the installations. It takes an hour or so to go through.\nteamLab\nis quite popular and generally sells out at least a few days in advance, so I recommend getting your tickets online ahead of time.\n6 Chome-1-16 Toyosu, Koto City, teamlab.art/e/planets. Open Monday-Sunday 9am-10pm; last entry is one hour before closing. Admission is 3,800 JPY for adults during weekdays and 4,200 JPY on weekends. Discounts are available for children and those with disabilities.\nAdmire the Imperial Palace\nWhen the emperor moved from\nKyoto\nto Tokyo in 1869, he took Edo for his new residence and renamed it Tokyo. Though you can\u2019t go inside (or get very close), the building is amazing. It is surrounded by lovely grounds and a park, and there\u2019s a moat around the stone walls. You can also see the changing of the guard, though it\u2019s a relatively low-key and unassuming ceremony.\nTokyo Localized\noffers a free walking tour of the gardens that is worth taking and lasts 2.5 hours.\nAdmission to the grounds is free.\nFeast below the Girders\nNot far from the palace is the Yurakucho neighborhood. Below the elevated train tracks at Yurakucho Station is a 700-meter stretch of wine bars, beer pubs, and casual restaurants filled with businessmen. It\u2019s a good spot for lunch, though it gets the most busy after work, when people stop in for food and happy hour on their way home.\nScale the Tokyo Tower\nBuilt in 1957 and resembling the Eiffel Tower, the Tokyo Tower is taller (at 333 meters/1,092 feet) than its European version and made entirely of steel. It was the city\u2019s tallest structure until the \u201cSkytree\u201d was built in 2010. You can pay to go all the way to the top floor to take in the view, but frankly, the main observation deck offers one that\u2019s just as good.\n4 Chome-2-8 Shibakoen, Minato, +81 3-3433-5111, tokyotower.co.jp. Open daily 9am-11pm.\nAdmission is 1,200 JPY.\nRelax at Meiji Jingu\nLocated at the northern end of Yoyogi Park, Meiji Jingu is a peaceful Shinto shrine honoring Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken, who helped modernize Japan. It\u2019s nestled in a serene forest, with a big wooden gate marking the entrance and paths lined with trees. You really don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in one of the busiest, most densely populated cities in the world when you wander around here. Watch traditional ceremonies, stroll through the gardens, or check out the museum. (FYI: It gets really busy on the weekends.)\n1-1 Yoyogikamizonocho, Shibuya City, +81 3-3379-5511, meijijingu.or.jp. Open every day of the year from sunrise to sunset. Admission is free.\nEnjoy Yoyogi Park\nOne of Tokyo\u2019s largest parks, Yoyogi is laced with walking paths, forested areas, and ponds. It is also used for music events and festivals throughout the year, and you\u2019ll see many street performers and shops selling snacks. If you\u2019re visiting in late March or early April, you\u2019ll be able to catch the cherry blossoms. In the fall, the ginkgo forest takes on a beautiful golden color.\n2-1 Yoyogikamizonocho, Shibuya City, +81 3-3469-6081, tokyo-park.or.jp/park/yoyogi. Open 24 hours, though some facilities have shorter opening times. Admission is free.\nGet trendy in Harajuku\nHarajuku is one of the most iconic districts in Tokyo. It\u2019s renowned for its avant-garde take on fashion, it\u2019s the epicenter of anime and\nkawaii\n(cuteness) culture in Tokyo, with lots of quirky and vintage-clothing stores and street art. Walking around the area, you\u2019ll see all kinds of outfits, mostly worn by younger Japanese people (predominantly teenagers), making it a fun place to people-watch and window-shop. If you want to go shopping, this is one of the best areas to do it in. you\u2019ll find a lot of the best Japanese designers here.\nDine with ninjas\nFor a unique dining experience, head to Ninja Tokyo (formerly Ninja Akasaka), a ninja-themed restaurant designed like an Edo-era building, with wait staff clothed in stereotypical all-black garb and trained in all sorts of tricks and illusions. You\u2019ll order off old scrolls while being entertained by the skills of your server! It\u2019s super fun.\nTokyu Plaza Akasaka, +81 3-5157-3936, ninja-tokyo.jp. Open daily 5pm-10pm, plus 11:30am-2pm on weekends.\nDrink in Golden Gai\nThis district, lined with backstreet bars, may be touristy, but it\u2019s one of the most fun in Tokyo. These zigzag alleys are filled with hole-in-the-wall bars serving cheap drinks. Each is unique, so it\u2019s fun to pop in and out of them. It\u2019s very touristy, but you\u2019ll find a lot of Japanese people here too. It\u2019s quite crowded on the weekends, so go early before the bars fill up.\nIf you want a deep dive into the area,\ntake a food tour\n. Arigato Tours runs an evening tour around Golden Gai and Omoide Yokocho in Shinjuku that will show you around and let you sample the best ramen and yakitori in the area.\nTokyo Itinerary: Day 2\nCheck out Asakusa\nIf you want to see some of Tokyo\u2019s historic religious sites, spend some time wandering around Asakusa. Just start as early as you can to avoid the crowds (especially if you plan on taking photos). These are two places not to be missed:\nSenso-ji\n\u2013 Tokyo\u2019s most popular and famous temple is beautifully painted and sits in a scenic spot near a pagoda and the impressive Kaminari Gate. There\u2019s a huge statue of Kannon, the goddess of mercy, inside the main hall.\n2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa, Taito, +81 3-3842-0181, senso-ji.jp. The grounds are open 24/7, though the temple itself is open daily 6am-5pm. Admission is free.\nAsakusa Shrine\n\u2013 Not far from Senso-ji is this Shinto shrine, built during the Edo period and which survived the air raids of World War II. This is much more peaceful than Senso-ji, with fewer people, whom you\u2019ll be able to see praying, meditating, or performing traditional rituals.\n2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa, Taito, +81 3-3844-1575, asakusajinja.jp. Open daily 9am-4:30pm. Admission is free.\nExplore Ueno Park\nSpanning over 133 acres, Ueno Park is a lovely spot to spend the day. Various stalls and vendors sell snacks, drinks, and souvenirs. On weekends, there are usually cultural events or festivals showcasing traditional arts, music, and dance. During cherry blossom season, the park is full of people picnicking and admiring the thousands of trees. The park is also home to some of Tokyo\u2019s best museums:\nTokyo National Museum\n\u2013Established in 1872, this massive museum in the north end of the park houses one of the world\u2019s largest collections of art and artifacts from Asia, particularly Japan.\n13-9 Uenokoen, Taito, +81 3-3822-1111, tnm.jp. Open daily 9:30am-5pm (7pm on Fridays and Saturdays). Admission is 1,000 JPY.\nTosho-gu Shrine\n\u2013 This beautiful 17th-century Shinto shrine with carved gold doors and ornate carvings can also be found in the park.\n9-88 Uenokoen, Taito, +81 3-3822-3455, uenotoshogu.com/en. Open daily 9am-5:30pm (4:30pm in winter). Admission is free up to the wall, though to go further inside is 500 JPY. To enter the shrine and peony garden costs 1,600 JPY. There\u2019s also a combo ticket for the shrine and treasure hall for 2,100 JPY.\nNational Museum of Nature and Science\n\u2013 Opened in 1871, this museum houses exhibitions on pre-Meiji science. There are over 5,000,000 items in the collection, with 14,000 of them on permanent display. It\u2019s also home to the taxidermied body of the legendary dog Hachiko, the loyal dog who would greet his owner at Shibuya Station on return from his daily commute (more on him later).\n7-20 Uenokoen, +81 50-5541-8600, kahaku.go.jp. Open Tuesday-Sunday 9am-5pm. Admission is 630 JPY.\nNational Museum of Western Art\n\u2013 This is one of the only museums in the country to focus on Western art, established in 1959. The collection of almost 5,000 pieces extends from the Renaissance all the way to the 20th century.

This area is also where you\u2019ll find the famous maid caf\u00e9s, where servers dress up as maids and serve you food and drinks. The girls on the street are promoting the more hole-in-the-wall options, which are a lot more culturally fun than the big touristy ones. (They aren\u2019t cheap, though, as you have to buy drinks packages and pay a fee, but it\u2019s kitschy and fun.)\nBathe in a sento\nA\nsento\nis a traditional public bathhouse, typically separated by gender.

The area is buzzing at night, with bright lights and frenzied activity \u2014 like Times Square on steroids. Make sure to visit the dog statue between Shibuya Station and the intersection (at the Hachiko Exit) \u2014 it\u2019s a tribute to Hachiko, the loyal dog who would greet his owner at Shibuya Station on return from his daily commute. This continued until the owner passed away at work in 1925.

Here are some suggestions:\nSee Daibutsu (the Great Buddha)\nMake a day trip to Kamakura, where you can see a 13-meter (42-foot) bronze statue of Buddha. It was initially built in 1252 within a temple, but the structure was washed away \u2014 on several occasions \u2014 by storms. The statue now sits in the open air, (along with a massive pair of straw sandals that belong to the statue). You can even go inside the statue itself  \u2014 there isn\u2019t much to see, but it\u2019s still kind of neat to be able to step into a massive statue of that size and importance.\nThe journey to Kamakura takes around an hour and is free with a\nJapan Rail Pass\n.\n4 Chome-2-28 Hase, Kamakura, +81 467-22-0703, kotoku-in.jp.

There are plenty of hiking trails, though you can also take a cable car to the top and then hike to the shrine that sits on the peak, some 930 meters (3,050 feet) above sea level. It\u2019s a 30-minute walk to the shrine from the peak or top of the cable car. From there, you can hike for an hour to a small valley with two picturesque waterfalls or continue on to Mount Otake, which is about two hours from the summit of Mount Mitake.\nBehold Mount Fuji\nLocated just over an hour from Tokyo and standing at an impressive 3,776 meters (12,389 feet), Mount Fuji is one of the most iconic views in the country. It is also an active stratovolcano (it last erupted in 1708) and one of the Three Holy Mountains of Japan. Covered in snow for almost half of the year, it is both a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and a UNESCO Cultural Site. In the summer, the mountain is open to hikers, who spend anywhere from 5 to 12 hours reaching the summit. Traditionally, hikers depart at night to arrive at the top for the sunrise.\nIf you don\u2019t want to hike to the peak, you can simply visit on a day trip.

Designed by Miyazaki himself, it is an immersive experience that any film buff will appreciate. There is also a new short film every month, only available to visitors. The museum won\u2019t take up a whole day, but it\u2019s not in a very central location, so you\u2019ll need to plan accordingly.\n1 Chome-1-83 Shimorenjaku, +81 570-055-777, ghibli-museum.jp.

In 1983, the residence became a museum and is now home to a rotating series of modern art exhibitions.\n5-21-9 Shirokanedai, +81 3-3443-0201, teien-art-museum.ne.jp/en. Open daily 10am-6pm. Garden admission is 200 JPY; museum admission varies depending on the current exhibition.\nPromenade along the Meguro River\nThe Meguro River weaves almost 8 kilometers (5 miles) through Tokyo and makes for a magnificent stroll.

There\u2019s also plenty of restaurants along the way to stop and eat at!\nTake the Harry Potter studio tour\nIf you love\nHarry Potter\n, this studio tour is a must.

You can wander iconic sets like the Great Hall and Diagon Alley, see original props and costumes from the films, and learn how they were made. There are also sections on the newer\nFantastic Beasts\nfilms. It takes about 3 hours to see it all.

Just hearing the name conjures up images of densely packed skyscrapers, streets lined with larger-than-life advertisements and crowded public spaces.\nShibuya Crossing\nYes, that vision is correct, but as we discovered during our 4 days in Tokyo, there is much more to the city than first meets the eye.\nTokyo is a city where the past, present and innovations for the future co-exist in perfect harmony.\nNear the Imperial Palace\nIt\u2019s a megacity with something for everyone- an intriguing pop culture, modern architecture, traditional temples and shrines, large parks, quiet gardens, informative museums, high-end shopping, a thriving nightlife and endless opportunities for people watching.\nTo best experience Tokyo, a multi-day visit is required. I recommend spending at least 4 days in Tokyo to be able to explore numerous districts, plus have time for a day trip outside the city.\nStreet in Asakusa, near Sensoji Temple.\nHow to Spend 4 Days in Tokyo- Planning Your Visit\nDuring our 4 days in Tokyo, we immersed ourselves in the hustle and bustle, reflected at temples and shrines, took walks in the parks and admired the city from above.\nAdmittedly, we arrived to Tokyo without much of a plan, not sure what we wanted to see and do. Therefore, our visit was not as efficient as it could have been. We spent a lot of time crisscrossing the city on the subway. Some days I felt like that\u2019s all we were doing!\nTokyo is so big that you should treat it like multiple separate cities (which it sort of is, being made up of 23 special wards).

However, I believe we could have seen this all on our original 4 day visit to Tokyo had we been more organized. On our first trip we inexplicably missed out on Meiji Shrine, even though we were right across the street from it (a big regret, so it was the first place I went on my return visit). The Edo-Tokyo museum is the other addition.\nHere\u2019s a look at how we chose to spend our 4 days in Tokyo, all conveniently organized into zones- Western Tokyo, Central Tokyo, Northern Tokyo- plus a day trip that is not to be missed! We hope this Tokyo itinerary helps you plan your own 4 day trip to Tokyo!\nNote:\nLinks will open in a new window for your convenience\nDay 1: Western Tokyo\nNeighbourhoods visited: Shibuya, Harajuku, Yoyogi, Shinjuku\nShibuya\nTo start our visit to Tokyo, we jumped right in and set out to experience the modern, bustling side of the city by visiting Shibuya, one of the busiest neighbourhoods in Tokyo. During the day Shibuya is a trendy shopping area, at night a lively entertainment district.\nArriving at Shibuya Station was quite overwhelming as it\u2019s the fourth busiest train station in Japan, handling about 2.4 million passengers on an average weekday. We managed not to get lost and found our way to the Hachiko exit, which is what you want for a memorable first impression of Shibuya.\nExiting at Hachiko Square, we were greeted by flashing video screens, bright neon signs, and the famous\nShibuya Crossing\n.\nShibuya Crossing is rumoured to be the world\u2019s busiest intersection and was quite the spectacle, even on a Sunday.\nSnagging a window seat at the Starbucks across from the station, we had a prime position to watch the infamous \u201cScramble\u201d.\nWhen the traffic lights turn red, people come from all directions to hurriedly cross the street. You\u2019d think it would be chaos, with people walking into each other, but it looked almost like a choreographed dance.\nThe Shibuya Scramble is definitely one of the best people watching experiences in Tokyo!\nCheck hotel prices and availability in Shibuya\nHarajuku\nMoving on to Harajuku, Tokyo\u2019s fashion district, we hoped to see some of the outrageous fashions of teenage Harajuku culture.\nWalking up the narrow alley of\nTakeshita-dori\n, we saw shops selling unique clothes and places serving crepes, but mostly it was just shoulder-to-shoulder people. We didn\u2019t even see any Harajuku girls.\nWhile Takeshita-dori was fun to see, it wasn\u2019t somewhere I wanted to spend a lot of time (too many people!)\nLuckily, at the end of the street I could retreat into the forested grounds of Meiji Shrine.\nMeiji-jingu (Meiji Shrine)\nMeiji Shrine is one of my favourite places in Tokyo and an absolute pleasure to visit in the early morning hours, when very few people are around.\nNestled within a sprawling forest of about 100,000 trees, Meiji Shrine is the perfect place to go when you tire of Tokyo\u2019s modern skyscrapers. Here you can enjoy a relaxing stroll in the shade, connect with nature and experience the traditional side of Japanese culture.\nMeiji Shrine is dedicated to Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken, making it Tokyo\u2019s most important Shinto shrine.\nRead my full post about\nMeiji Shrine.\nTokyo Metropolitan Government Offices- West Shinjuku\nWest Shinjuku is not that interesting because it\u2019s mainly office towers, but those towers offer fantastic views of Tokyo.\nFor a view with a price that can\u2019t be beat (it\u2019s free!), we headed up to the 45\nth\nfloor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building. The twin, 202m high towers each have an indoor observatory where you can overlook the city.\nOn a clear day you can apparently catch a glimpse of\nMt. Fuji\n, but I never saw it on either of my two visits to the observatory at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building.\nEast Shinjuku\nEast Shinjuku is fun to visit at night when the neon signs cast a glow over the skyscraper-lined streets.\nThis part of Shinjuku can be thought of as Tokyo\u2019s playground. A centre for nightlife, there are bars, movie theatres, pachinko parlours and restaurants.\nIf you visit during the day, you\u2019ll be able to browse department stores and perhaps even catch a glimpse of\nGodzilla\nfiercely peering over the Shinjuku Toho building and Hotel Gracery.\nIf you\u2019re a true Godzilla fan, you\u2019ll want to go inside the hotel lobby to see the display of Godzilla movie posters throughout the years. Also, if you happen to be there at the top of the hour (from noon-8:00 pm), you\u2019ll witness Godzilla roaring and breathing steam.\nThe giant Godzilla head can be found at 1-19-1 Kabukicho and is a 5 minute walk from the east exit of JR Shinjuku Station.\nCheck hotel prices and availability in Shinjuku\nDay 2: Central Tokyo and Tokyo Bay\nNeighbourhoods visited: Shibakoen,\u00a0Marunouchi, Odaiba\nTokyo Tower\nWe started our second day in Tokyo by heading to Shiba Park to visit Tokyo Tower.\nTokyo Tower is modelled after the\nEiffel Tower in Paris\n, but is taller and, in our opinion, not as elegant. We thought it looked less like a work of art and more like a functional broadcast tower (which it is).\nStill, Tokyo Tower was worth visiting because of the two viewpoints overlooking the city- one at 150 metres and the other at 250 metres. We went up to both viewing levels (the top one has the best views) and got a good sense at just how big Tokyo is. The city was sprawled out as far as we could see!\nTokyo Imperial Palace\nNext we made our way to the Imperial Palace, which is where the Emperor and his family live.\nI knew the palace wasn\u2019t open to the public, but was surprised to find out that the East Garden of the Imperial Palace was closed as well (it was a Monday. The garden is also closed on Fridays).\nDisappointed, we instead walked around the perimeter of the grounds. It actually was quite nice to stroll alongside the moats and stone walls.\nSoon we came to the\nNijubashi\n, a double-arched stone bridge that serves as the entrance to the inner palace grounds. From the bridge, you can even catch a glimpse of the Imperial Palace.\nUpdate:\nI\u2019ve since been back to Tokyo and was able to visit the Imperial Palace East Gardens. The highlight was the Ninomaru Japanese garden- so beautiful!\nTokyo International Forum\nWhile not a major tourist attraction, the\nTokyo International Forum\nis worth visiting if you appreciate architecture. The ceiling of the glass atrium resembles a ship\u2019s hull, making it one of Tokyo\u2019s most distinctive buildings.\nCheck hotel prices and availability in Central Tokyo\nOdaiba & Tokyo Bay\nAs evening approached, we made our way across Tokyo Bay to the island of Odaiba (Daiba).\nTo get there, we took a surprisingly fun ride on the driverless Yurikamome monorail. Sitting in the front seat, we got fantastic views of the city\u2019s night lights as the train looped above the harbour then crossed Rainbow Bridge. I felt like we were riding into a theme park!\nWe spent most of our time in Odaiba along the waterfront, going for walks and enjoying a meal at as we gazed across the bay. There is a small replica of the\nStatue of Liberty\nhere but I was most enamored with\nRainbow Bridge\nand its backdrop of city lights. Tokyo sure is beautiful at night, especially when viewed from Odaiba!\nWe wish we arrived to Odaiba earlier in the day because we really liked the feel of this area of Tokyo. Next time, I want to ride the Ferris wheel at Palette Town and get some pictures of the futuristic-looking Fuji TV building.\nUpdate:\nPalette Town is undergoing a major redevelopment starting in 2022, so many of its attractions will be closing\n,\nincluding the Ferris wheel.\nCheck hotel prices and availability in Odaiba\nDay 3- Northern Tokyo\nNeighbourhoods visited: Ryogoku, Ueno, Asakusa, Oshiage\nEdo-Tokyo Museum\nNormally I don\u2019t like to visit museums on my travels, but the Edo-Tokyo Museum was one I\u2019m glad I decided to explore.\nThe Edo-Tokyo Museum captured my imagination with its scale-model dioramas, automated exhibits, miniature townspeople figurines and large-size building replicas. It was a fun and engaging place to learn about Tokyo\u2019s transition from the Edo period to present day metropolis.\nUpdate:\nThe Edo-Tokyo Museum will be temporarily closed for renovations from April 1, 2022 until possibly spring of 2026. The entire facility will be renovated including displays, equipment and more.\nRead my full post about the\nEdo-Tokyo Museum.\nCheck hotel prices and availability in Ryogoku\nUeno Park\nUeno Park is packed full of attractions and you could spend a lot of time here, if you so choose.\nThere are temples, shrines and multiple museums, including the Tokyo National Museum, National Science Museum and Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum.\nWe decided to stroll around outside, passing by a few statues, ponds and hundreds of cherry trees.\nUeno Park is also home to Japan\u2019s oldest Zoo,\nUeno Zoo\n. I have mixed feelings about zoos but ultimately we decided pay a visit because I\u2019ve always wanted to see giant pandas.\nRi Ri and Shin Shin are Ueno Zoo\u2019s biggest attraction and I couldn\u2019t help but smile as I watched them happily munch on bamboo stalks. So darn cute and wow, do they ever eat a lot!\nWe visited some of the other animals, but I was feeling uneasy about how small some of the enclosures were, so we decided to head to the exit.\nOn our way out though, we had to stop and say hi (okay, it was more like \u201cI love you\u201d) to the red panda. My favourite animal, the red panda always charms me with its adorable face. I just want to scoop it up and cuddle with it forever!\nCheck hotel prices and availability in Ueno\nSenso-ji Temple\nAfter Ueno Park, we went to the Asakusa district to see Senso-ji, Tokyo\u2019s most visited temple, and in my opinion, most spectacular thanks to the five-story pagoda and huge red paper lantern at the gate.\nSenso-ji Temple is very busy during the day so there are plenty of opportunities to witness people engaging in traditional rituals, such as wafting smoke over them from the large incense burner.\nOn my second trip to Tokyo, I returned to Senso-ji at night and it was a completely different experience. There were no crowds, the grounds were quiet and the buildings looked even more dramatic when lit up by lights.\nRead my full post about\nSenso-ji Temple\n.\nSumida River\nFrom Senso-ji Temple, we walked to nearby Sumida River to take in the nice views of the Tokyo Skytree.\nAs we crossed the river on our way to the Skytree, we had to wonder and laugh about the interesting architecture of the\nAsahi Breweries headquarters\n!\nTokyo Skytree\nWe ended our last full day in Tokyo by going up the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest tower, and second tallest structure, in the world.\nI loved visiting the Tokyo Skytree after dark since it gave us a different perspective of the city, which we had previously seen from above only during the day.\nWe got a ticket to go up to the highest level (450 metres), but I don\u2019t think it was worth it since the view from the main observation deck (350 metres) was just as great.\nBesides the fantastic views, I appreciated that photographers are allowed to use tripods, so I got some good\nphotos of Tokyo at night\n, even when shooting through glass.\nWe were hoping to eat supper at the top of the Skytree, but the restaurant was already closing. Instead we went to a different tower of the Skytree Town (a complex of restaurants, shops and other attractions) to eat a late dinner. It was actually pretty cool to eat where we did because all the tables were set up to face the Skytree, so we got to admire it while we ate.\nC\nheck hotel prices and availability in Asakusa\nDay 4- Day Trip to Nikko\nFor our last day in Tokyo we decided to do a day trip to Nikko. A forested area dotted with temples and shrines, Nikko was a welcome break from the towers and crowded streets of Tokyo.\nWe had a fabulous day exploring Nikko\u2019s sacred areas and taking walks in nature, but the highlight was visiting the surprisingly lavish\nNikko Toshogu Shrine\n.\nRead my full post about our\nday trip to Nikko\n.\nFinal Thoughts on Our 4 Days in Tokyo\nIt took me a while to warm up to Tokyo but eventually I did come around to liking it. After two visits, I now consider it to be one of the world\u2019s greatest cities and best\nplaces in Japan to visit\n.\nWe liked how Tokyo had something to please both of us. There were high-rises, a fast-paced atmosphere and quirky pop-culture for Mike, along with pockets of nature, spiritual spaces and traditional architecture for me. Getting to experience the effortless mix of old and new, man-made and nature, is just one reason why we think Tokyo belongs on a\nJapan bucket list\n.\nYasuda Garden in Ryogoku.\nWhat was most impressive, however, was how clean and efficient Tokyo was. Litter on the street was almost non-existent and public transportation (coupled with a culture of order and respect) enabled millions of people to move around the city with ease.\nSprawling in size, Tokyo can at first be overwhelming. It requires some thoughtful planning to make the most of your time, but it\u2019s a city you could visit over and over again and always discover something new!\nNational Sumo Stadium in Ryogoku.\nMore Places to See in Tokyo\nSince writing this post, I\u2019ve made a third trip to Tokyo and have a few more places I\u2019d recommend adding to your Tokyo itinerary.\nShinjuku Gyoen National Garden\nI absolutely loved Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in East Shinjuku. I spent an entire afternoon strolling around the park and its different gardens, even finding some early blooming cherry trees. In my opinion, this is Tokyo\u2019s most beautiful park, way prettier than Ueno Park.\nNezu Shrine\nNezu Shrine is under the radar of most tourists so it\u2019s a pleasant place to visit if you want to avoid crowds. It\u2019s one of Tokyo\u2019s oldest shrines and features a tunnel of small torii gates and hillside of azalea bushes. Nezu Shrine is in the Bunkyo ward, an easy 20 minute walk from Ueno Park.\nRead my full post about\nNezu Shrine.\nTips for Visiting Tokyo\nGetting to and from the Airports:\nTokyo has two major airports- Narita and Haneda. I\u2019ve flown into both and preferred Haneda because it is way closer to the city centre than Narita (which is 66 kms away from central Tokyo).\nNarita Airport: The fastest and (usually cheapest) way to get to the city is by train. We took the Narita Express to Tokyo Station and it took a little less than an hour. The Narita Express also goes to Shinjuku, Shibuya and Shinagawa stations. Trains run every half-hour and tickets can be bought in the airport terminals.\nJapan Rail Pass\nholders can ride for free.\nLimousine buses leave hourly and shuttle visitors to major hotels and train stations. Plan to spend 1.5- 2 hours on the bus.\nIf you prefer to use a shared transfer/shuttle van for direct to hotel service, here is where you can\nbook a transfer to/from Narita Airport\n.\nDon\u2019t take a taxi from Narita airport- it will cost a fortune!\nHaneda Airport: I used the Tokyo Monorail (free with a JR Pass) to get from Haneda airport to Hamamatsucho station on the JR Yamanote line. It takes about 15 minutes. Once on the Yamanote line you can get to the major train stations.\nLimousine buses leave hourly and stop at major stations like Shibuya, Shinjuku and Tokyo. Buses operate between 5:00 am and 12:30 am.\nIf you\u2019d like to use a shared transfer/shuttle van for direct to hotel service, here is where you can\nbook a transfer from Haneda Airport\n.\nUsing the Subway in Tokyo:\nTokyo\u2019s subway system is a massive network, but the colour-coded maps and bilingual signage make it very easy to use.\nThe subway is operated by two different companies. Tokyo Metro operates nine lines and Toei operates four. It\u2019s important to note which group you will be using, as they require separate tickets.\nIt\u2019s easy to purchase tickets as the machines have an English option. You can buy single fare tickets or choose from a few day pass options. The machines accept coins and bills.\nFares are determined according to how far you ride and are displayed on the large map above the ticket machines. If you are not sure how much to pay, just buy the least expensive ticket and use the fare adjustor machine at the exit gate of your destination station to pay the remaining amount.\nInstead of buying individual tickets, you can get a Suica or Pasmo Card. This prepaid card is valid on all subway, local rail and bus lines in Tokyo (and most regions in Japan). Simply touch the card to the electronic reader and the cost of your trip will be debited. The Suica and Pasmo cards can be reloaded with more yen if needed.\nYou can also buy a Tokyo Subway Ticket. Tickets include unlimited access to all Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway lines and are valid for 24, 48, or 72 consecutive hours. They can be purchased online\nhere\n(you will be sent a QR code that needs to be exchanged for a physical ticket at a ticket vending machine in major stations).\nTokyo\u2019s subway can be very busy and crowded (especially between 8:00 am-9:30 am and 5:00 pm-8:00 pm). Be prepared to have to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with other commuters.\nPeople are very quiet on subways and trains. Follow the locals\u2019 lead and refrain from talking loudly and using your cell phone.\nThe Japanese make orderly line-ups when waiting for the subway (it\u2019s marked on the platform where the doors will be when the train stops). When the train doors open, people will move aside and stand along the train, making it easy for passengers to get off.\nThe whole subway system in Tokyo shuts down around midnight until 5:00 am.\nThere are subway cars that are designated for women only.\nTaking the Train (Japan Rail) in Tokyo:\nIn addition to the subway, Japan Rail also operates within the city. The JR Yamanote line makes a loop around Tokyo and stops at the city\u2019s main hubs including Shinjuku, Shibuya, Shimbashi, Tokyo and Ueno stations. We used this line a few times during our 4 days in Tokyo.\nIf you have a Japan Rail Pass (\npurchase online here\n) you can travel for free on the Yamanote line, the Narita Express (serves Narita airport), the Tokyo Monorail (serves Haneda airport), and a few other JR lines that cross the city.\nGet an eSIM from\nAiralo\nso that you have access to affordable data for checking train schedules on the go.\nCredit Cards and ATMs:\nMost places in Tokyo take credit cards (but not all taxis). We had no trouble using them at hotels and restaurants.\nOur bank cards worked fine at ATMs in Tokyo. The best place to find ATMs that work with foreign debit cards is at 7-Eleven. You can also find English ATMs at Post offices, but they are closed on evenings and weekends.\nShinjuku\nTours in Tokyo\nHere is a trusted site that has a huge inventory of\ntours and tickets for activities in Tokyo\n. You can book everything from themed walking tours, cooking classes, shows, bike tours, cultural craft and art experiences, day trips out of the city, and private tours with a local.\nAccommodations in Tokyo\nFor your convenience, here is a list of\nhotels in Tokyo\n.

New York City is on practically everyone's bucket list, and for good reason. Not only is it an icon of American history and culture, but it also has so many amazing things to do. I've been to New York over 10 times (it's possible to drive from Washington DC) and have crafted the perfect New York itinerary for 3 days. It's easy to get overwhelmed when thinking about what to do in New York. In this 3 day New York itinerary, I'll share the best things to do in New York City on your trip and help you decide what you really want to try to fit in by giving you options depending on whether you're a foodie, history buff, or view seeker! Table of Contents Getting There Bus, train, drive, or fly? I've done all four, which have pros and cons depending on your budget and where you are traveling from. I'll outline each below. Drive If you're taking a car or coming to New York, you can drive here, but there are some things you should know. Tolls are expensive to get into the city, and you'll have to cross over one from almost any direction to get there. Once you are in the city and over the bridges, you will likely not have to worry about any more tolls. All New York toll roads are cashless and require a small removable transponder to pay your toll. Toll booths in New York are managed by E-ZPass, and transponders can be obtained online. New York is famous for its traffic, and it is sometimes terrible. A few miles can take you over an hour to get across, so plan ahead! Last, parking on the street is hard to come by in most areas and will likely have restrictions. I'd recommend you plan ahead and pay for parking before getting to New York to save time and money. Many hotels and garages will charge more than $50 a day for parking, so it's best to plan ahead so you aren't stuck with a giant bill. Bus Many different bus lines operate up and down the East Coast, and while not always the most convenient, they tend to be the cheapest way to get to New York. MegaBus, Greyhound, Peter Pan, Best Bus, and more offer bus tickets to New York for as low as $5. I took one of these buses, and while it did take longer than the other options below, it was the cheapest. Train Amtrak lines connect New York to essentially every major city along the East Coast with regular and high-speed service daily in and out of Penn Station and Moynihan Train Hall. The train hall is right in the center of Manhattan, making it a great place to start your New York trip. Flights There are three airports close to New York City, and you can fly into any of the three and take public transit to get into the city. JFK International Airport John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, is New York's largest airport. It's about 15 miles from Midtown Manhattan and is served by over 70 international and domestic airlines. From JFK, you can catch a cab to anywhere in Manhattan for a flat fee of $52, plus tax, tolls, gratuity, and a surcharge of $4.50 during peak hours from 4 to 8 pm on weekdays. If you want to skip the private ride, JFK's AirTrain operates 24/7 and links the airport to several public transit options for an $8 ticket. Hop on the AirTrain Red line to catch the Long Island Railroad or the J-Z and E trains at Jamaica Station, or take the Airtrain Green line to connect to the A train at Howard Beach station. Taking the Long Island Railroad from Jamaica Station will take you to Manhattan's Penn Station in about 20 minutes. LaGuardia Airport LaGuardia Airport in East Elmhurst, Queens, is approximately eight miles from Midtown and serves mostly domestic destinations, with a few flights arriving from Canada. From there, ride a metered taxi (which will also charge tolls and tips) or catch one of two city buses (the Q70 and the M60) to connect with the subway. You'll need patience for the latter and the swipe of a MetroCard for $2.75. Newark Liberty International Airport Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, is 16 miles from Midtown and is a hub for domestic and international flights. Metered taxis will transport you to the city, though it can cost around $100 with tolls and tips. AirTrain Newark, however, connects to NJ Transit for an easy, cheaper ride into Penn Station in under 30 minutes. Where to Stay There are so many amazing areas to stay in New York it's hard to narrow it down, but below, I'll outline three areas I'd recommend for your trip, ranging from the cheapest to most expensive options. All are located close to the places on this itinerary and accessible by subway. Long Island City Long Island City sounds super far from Manhattan, right? Well, it's just across the water from Midtown Manhattan (pictured above on the right) and is just two train stops away from many sites worth visiting. Long Island City is known for its gleaming high-rises with sweeping views of Manhattan. Innovative art galleries, performance spaces, and pockets of trendy bars and restaurants can be found all over this area. This area is more affordable than Manhattan, but still very convenient to get to everything on this itinerary. Generally speaking, it's the cheapest area on this list for hotels! Recommended hotels: The Local NY (hostel, good location) TownePlace Suites by Marriott (comfortable, views of the river) Hilton Garden Inn (comfortable, great location, easy parking) Ravel Hotel (trendy, great view of Manhattan) Lower East Side If you're looking for a more local feel in a neighborhood with some of the best food, then this is the perfect place to stay. The eclectic Lower East Side is where gritty alleys and tenement-style buildings mix with upscale apartments and chic boutiques. Nighttime draws hip, young crowds to the area's trendy bars, music venues, and restaurants. The neighborhood's Jewish heritage lives on through Orchard Street's Lower East Side Tenement Museum, fabric stores, and traditional delis such as Katz's and Russ & Daughters. Recommended hotels: Hotel Indigo (great rooftop, modern feel, rooftop pictured on left of this section) Moxy Hotel (trendy, easy parking) Midtown Manhattan Midtown Manhattan is full of the most popular things to do in New York. It's centrally located, but also the most crowded of the three areas I am recommending. This is not a good spot to stay if you drive in, as parking is the most challenging/expensive in this part of the city. It is the most convenient location and walkable to many things on this New York itinerary (3 days) for most trips; I wouldn't recommend staying in this area, but because this is a short one, being centrally located can be a good thing. Recommended hotels: Marriott Marquis (in Times Square, great views) citizenM Hotel (blocks off Times Square, upscale feel) Civilian Hotel (modern, boutique) Getting Around Public Transportation The New York City subway system is one of the best systems in the world for public transportation. You'll find a local subway stop just a few blocks away from almost everywhere on your New York itinerary. I would highly recommend getting a subway pass and taking it for the majority of your trip! You can get a prepaid card, or you can get a single trip card. If you're paying per ride, you get one free transfer within two hours of your first swipe (bus to bus or train to bus only). Once you exit through the subway turnstiles, you can't transfer to another line or reenter the station without paying again. An unlimited card gives you as many transfers as you'd like, but you can't use it at the same station within 18 minutes of your first swipe, so individual or pay-as-you-go cards are the best options if you're sharing with travel companions. For contactless payment, you can either pick up an OMNY card and top up your account online or tap your contactless credit or debit card or electronic device on an OMNY reader to pass through the turnstile. Taxis or Uber? New York City has the most expensive Ubers in the U.S., at $34.74 per 6.2 miles. Both conventional taxis and Uber charge fares based on a combination of time and distance Ta. s do not have surge pricing and use old-world pricing, but riders might have to wait longer when demand exceeds supply. Uber does not differentiate between cruising and stop-and-go traffic, while taxis charge different rates based on speed. The results might shock you. She found that without tips or surge pricing, hailing a cab was always less expensive than an UberX or a standard Lyft. Cab prices averaged 35-83% less than a ride-share. Prices for the same rides on the taxi cab app CURB varied. I say all this to tell you, expect to pay a lot when you get a taxi or Uber in New York, expect to be stuck in a lot of traffic, and avoid this when possible. Day 1: Central Park, Upper East Side, Midtown On your first day in New York, it's time to see some of the most iconic sites that the city has and take in some of the biggest sites to knock those off your list. Spend a morning in Central Park, then head to the Met. From there, walk around the Upper East Side (stroll Madison Ave), then end your day in Times Square. Central Park This is one of the most magical places in New York and the perfect place to start your trip. Start at the southern part of the park and walk from there in order to do everything on this itinerary. I'd recommend choosing 1-3 stops listed below. Otherwise, you won't have enough time to do everything on this itinerary! 1. Picnic in Sheeps Meadow or by the Pond: Grab a bagel from pretty much anywhere before going into the park. Bring it with you into the south side of the park and choose a spot. You can either hang out in Sheeps Meadow, which is known for its picnics and you'll likely see lots of New Yorkers hanging out here on a nice day. The Pond is home to the Gapstowe Bridge and close to Wollman Rink (where you can ice skate in the winter!). 2. Central Park Zoo: This is a stop I'd recommend making with kids or if you are an animal lover. Not far from the Pond, you'll find the Central Park Zoo. $20 for Adults / $15 for Children (3-12) & free (2 & under) / $17 for seniors (65+) Pro-tip: General admission tickets are included with the purchase of the New York Go City Sightseeing Pass, which is a tourist discount pass perfect for doing a lot of activities in NYC. 3. Bethesda Terrace and Fountain: Bethesda Terrace and Fountain are two architectural features overlooking the southern shore of the Lake in New York City's Central Park. The fountain, with its Angel of the Waters statue, is located in the center of the terrace. This is one of the prettiest and most famous parts of Central Park! 4. Rent a Row Boat: Central Park Boathouse has partially reopened, and the rowboats are available to rent as of June 17, 2023. Until notified, boats are available by walk-up and paid for with credit card or Apple Pay only. Online bookings will soon also be available through reservation service OpenTable. The restaurant's interior is being upgraded, and plans to reopen this fall. 5. Belvedere Castle: Walk through the Ramble (a beautiful part of the park, especially in fall) to one of the most iconic features in Central Park. This miniature castle is located atop the huge rock outcrop known as Vista Rock, the second highest natural point in Central Park. The entire complex, completed in 1872, was designed as a place from which to enjoy views of the surrounding landscape; the building originally had no windows or doors, as it was intended as an open-air lookout tower. It houses a welcome center, gift shop, and lookout point worth climbing to! From Belvedere Castle, head to the Met! The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) The Metropolitan Museum of Art is one of the world's largest and finest art museums. Its collection spans 5,000 years of world culture, from prehistory to the present and from every part of the globe. While its entire building space is technically smaller than the Louvre, the Metropolitan Museum covers the largest floor area of any museum in the world, at an incredible 2 million square feet. The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 by a group of American citizens - business people and financiers as well as leading artists and thinkers of the day - who wanted to create a museum to bring art and art education to the American people. After exploring for a few hours, make sure to take a break and head up to the Met's rooftop. They have drinks and bites to try with a view overlooking Central Park and Manhattan. It's beautiful and a great stop from all the walking you've been doing! General Admission: Adults, $30; Seniors (65 and over), $22; Students, $17; Children (under 12), Free. The New York Go City Sightseeing Pass grants free same-day admission to all of the Met Museum locations. You can also book a Met Tour through Walks Tours, one of my absolute favorite tour companies! Open 10 am - 5 pm Sunday - Tuesday & Thursday (closed Wednesday), 10 am - 9 pm weekends. Madison Ave If you have more time and want to do some shopping, Madison Ave is the right way to walk back down to Midtown Manhattan to get to your evening in Times Square! Madison Avenue features the flagship boutiques of the finest fashion & jewelry designers, world class art galleries, exquisite restaurants, spas, and salons for exclusive pampering. Shop small designers, or maybe you just like to window shop from the most famous luxury stores It's all possible here! Times Square End your day in the iconic Times Square. Times Square in New York City is one of the most iconic and bustling places on Earth. This area, located at the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, is home to some of the world's largest billboards and signs, making it a must-see destination for any traveler or tourist. The most famous street and section of Times Square is Broadway. This is where you'll spot the flashy lights and advertisements, where the ball drops on New Year's Eve, and the heart of the commercial district in this area where you'll find shops, restaurants, and the TKTS ticket counter to get Broadway tickets. You'll want these for day two, but more tips on getting them later! While in Times Square, I'd recommend eating at Serafina for some fantastic Italian. They have a few locations, are quick, and serve up good eats. If you plan on exploring New York at night, this is the night to do it! Take a cruise along the river to take in the views, visit an observatory at night, or hit the bars on the Lower East Side. There's a lot to do at night in New York! Day 2: Hudson Yards, Chelsea, Broadway On day two, we're checking out Hudson Yards, home to the Edge Observatory and the Hive. From there, walk the Highline over to Chelsea Market. Get a late brunch at one of the fantastic spots and see Little Island. After that, head back toward Midtown and the day with a Broadway show! Hudson Yards Hudson Yards is NYC's built-up neighborhood with new real estate, a fancy subway station that serves the 7 train as well as a handful of attractions like a one-million-square-foot retail center with over 100 places to go shopping in NYC, eat at cute restaurants, cultural performance venue The Shed, a five-acre innovative park and Vessel--a giant, metal beehive It's also home to Edge--NYC's highest observation deck. I'd recommend exploring Hudson Yards in the morning and getting a brunch reservation at Peak (at the Edge) in the morning for a perfect start to your day! Peak is a stunning restaurant space located on the 101st floor at the summit of the 1,296-foot tall tower, one level above Edge - the highest observation deck in the Western Hemisphere. Peak is a modern American destination, blending stunning views of New York City with elevated menus Plus when you eat here, you get free entry to the Edge. Edge tickets are $38 a piece, and a meal at Peak will run you about the same. Why not get food AND a view for $38 instead of just the view? Make sure you make a reservation in advance to secure a spot. Open 11 - 10:30 pm on weekends, 11:30 am - 10 pm on weekdays. Note: Entry into the Edge and many other things on this list are included in the New York Go City Sightseeing Pass. It's worth checking out for your first trip! Highline After getting a fantastic view of New York City, walk to Chelsea Market on the Highline. Prior to 1934, Tenth Avenue was known as \"Death Avenue\" because of the many accidents caused by then at-grade trains that ran on the street. New York Central Railroad built a new elevated train to service the area and improve safety; the West Side elevated, which we now know as The High Line. Trains passed through approximately 30 buildings, including meat packers and the Nabisco factory, which added to the neighborhood's distinctive architecture. Freight traffic began to decline in the 1960s as trucking became the preferred mode of commercial transportation, and the last train ran on the elevated in 1980. In 1999, a group of activists rallied to save the structure and convert it into a unique public space. This is how the Highline began. It offers unique views of the city, incredible art installations that change regularly, and a way to become a part of the history of the city. In the spring and fall, this can be quite nice to do with your partner. It can feel pretty romantic to walk along the Highline and take in the view hand in hand! Open daily from 7 am to 10 pm, free. Chelsea Market Chelsea Market is an excellent spot for lunch or even just a snack if you choose to have brunch at Peak. It's got a wide variety of food stalls inside to choose from, with all sorts of great foods New York is known for. Chelsea Market is housed in the former National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) factory complex, which was built in the 1890s. The building's architecture and industrial history make it an interesting and unique location for visitors. You'll find everything from gifts and flowers to home goods and gourmet specialty foods. Get a haircut, find the perfect bottle of wine, or catch an immersive art installation at Artechouse. Chelsea Market regularly hosts live music, sample sales, and other events. Check here for the latest events. Little Island or Whitney Museum of American Art If you're looking for a bit of time outside, head to Little Island. \"Little Island is a public park and performance space in New York City. It is a relatively new addition to the city's parks and recreational spaces, officially opening to the public in May 2021. Little Island is situated on the Hudson River, near the Meatpacking District and Chelsea neighborhoods of Manhattan. The park was funded by media mogul Barry Diller and his wife, fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg, who were inspired by the idea of creating a unique public space on the Hudson River. Little Island is a popular destination for locals and tourists, offering a mix of nature, art, and entertainment in the heart of Manhattan. It has quickly become a beloved addition to New York City's cultural and recreational scene. If you're interested in another museum, head to The Whitney Museum of Art. The Whitney Museum of American Art, often referred to simply as the Whitney, is a renowned museum in New York City dedicated to showcasing American art from the 20th and 21st centuries. It was founded by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, an art patron and collector, in 1930. The museum has undergone several relocations and expansions over the years and is currently located in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan. The Whitney's collection includes a wide range of American art, from paintings and sculptures to multimedia installations, photography, and works on paper. The collection features works by prominent American artists, both historical and contemporary. Broadway No trip to New York is complete without seeing a show on Broadway. When buying Broadway tickets, be aware of the show's schedule, seating options, pricing, and any special promotions or discounts available. It's also a good idea to purchase tickets well in advance, especially for popular or high-demand shows. Lastly, watch out for any potential scams or fraudulent ticket sales and buy from reputable sources to ensure you receive valid tickets for the show you want to see. You can find Broadway tickets through various sources, both online and in person. Here are some common ways to purchase Broadway tickets: Official Broadway Websites: Many Broadway shows have official websites where you can buy tickets directly. These websites often provide information about show schedules, ticket availability, and pricing. Popular official ticketing websites include Telecharge and Ticketmaster. Online Ticketing Platforms: You can purchase Broadway tickets through popular online ticketing platforms such as Ticketmaster, Telecharge, Broadway. Com, TodayTix, and StubHub. These platforms provide a convenient way to browse shows, view seat availability, and make online bookings. Discount Ticket Services: There are several services that offer discounted Broadway tickets, including TKTS and TodayTix. TKTS has a physical booth in Times Square, another at South Street Seaport, and a mobile app that provides same-day discounted tickets for many Broadway and Off-Broadway shows. Theater Box Offices: You can visit the box office of the specific theater where the show is playing to buy tickets in person. This is often the best option if you want to purchase tickets on the day of the show or if you prefer the personal touch of speaking to a box office representative. Ticket Resellers: Be cautious when using ticket resellers or third-party sellers. While some legitimate resellers like StubHub exist, be wary of scalpers and buy from reputable sources to avoid scams and counterfeit tickets. Lotteries and Rush Tickets: Some shows offer lottery systems where you can enter for a chance to purchase discounted tickets. Rush tickets are also often available at the box office on the day of the show, usually at a lower price. These options are particularly popular for popular or sold-out shows. Discount Websites: Websites like BroadwayBox and Goldstar offer discounted tickets for Broadway shows. They may have special promo codes to help you save on ticket prices. Subscription Services: Consider subscription services like Broadway. Com's Season Ticketing, which allows you to purchase tickets for a series of Broadway shows at a discounted rate. Hotels and Packages: Some hotels in New York City offer packages that include Broadway tickets along with your stay. These packages can be convenient and offer some cost savings. Day 3: Lower Manhattan, Lower East Side or Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn In Lower Manhattan, you will find the 911 Memorial and Wall Street. After the morning there, spend your afternoon eating to your heart's content on a Lower East Side food tour. This part of the city has some of the most iconic/amazing food in NY. Stop by the Brooklyn Bridge when you're done. Photo purchased from Shutterstock 911 Memorial and Museum The 9/11 Memorial, also known as the National September 11 Memorial, is a solemn and poignant tribute to the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States. It serves as a place for remembrance, reflection, and commemoration. Visiting the outdoor 9/11 Memorial is free, but there is an admission fee to enter the museum. It's advisable to book museum tickets in advance, especially during peak tourist seasons, as it can get crowded. The memorial plaza is generally open daily, and the museum's hours may vary. Be sure to check the official website for up-to-date information on opening hours and any special events. The entrance fee into the 9/11 Museum is well worth it, in my opinion. Visiting the 9/11 Memorial and Museum is a profoundly moving and meaningful experience. It allows visitors to remember and pay their respects to the lives lost on that tragic day and to learn about the historical and cultural significance of the World Trade Center site. It's a place for reflection, unity, and honoring the bravery of first responders and all those affected by the events of 9/11. This museum is included in the New York Go City Sightseeing Pass. Photo by Robert Bye on Unsplash Wall Street From the 9/11 Memorial, walk over to Wall Street. This is a historic street in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. It is famous for its association with the financial industry, including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Federal Hall National Memorial. While the interior of the NYSE is not open to the public, you can stand outside the iconic building at 11 Wall Street and take photos. You may also see traders and financial professionals entering and exiting the building. Here are a few sites worth seeing while on Wall Street. Federal Hall National Memorial: Federal Hall is a historic site where the first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated in 1789. The building now serves as a museum and visitor center, offering exhibitions about American government and finance history. The Charging Bull: Located near Bowling Green, the Charging Bull is a famous bronze sculpture that has become a symbol of Wall Street. Visitors often take photos with this iconic artwork. Trinity Church: Trinity Church, located at the intersection of Wall Street and Broadway, is one of the oldest churches in New York City. The church and its historic cemetery are open to the public, and you can explore the church's beautiful architecture and learn about its history. Lower East Side or Statue of Liberty Lower East Side The Lower East Side (LES) is a vibrant neighborhood located in the southeastern part of Manhattan, New York City. It has a rich history and is known for its diverse culture, artistic scene, and wide range of dining, shopping, and entertainment options. The Lower East Side is famous for its diverse food scene. You can try traditional Jewish delis, modern eateries, trendy cafes, and international cuisine. Katz's Delicatessen is an iconic establishment known for its pastrami sandwiches. This makes it the perfect spot for a food tour with some of the most well-known food spots in the city in the neighborhood. Sidewalk Food Tours and Free Tours by Foot do several food tours all over New York City, and I'd recommend using them for this tour. They have a really unique model; you pay what you want at the end of the tour. We paid for our own food, and it was easy for people to share things or only get samples instead of ordering too much. You then paid our guide a generous tip at the end. No time for a food tour? Visit Essex Street Market instead. This market has served the neighborhood for over 75 years and features a selection of food vendors, offering everything from artisanal bread to fresh produce and international cuisines. Note: The New York Go City Sightseeing Pass includes a Lower East Side Food tour. It's worth checking out for your first trip! Powered by GetYourGuide Photo by Ferdinand Stöhr on Unsplash Statue of Liberty A visit to the Statue of Liberty is not just a tour; it's a meaningful and educational experience that allows you to connect with the history of the United States and the ideals of liberty and freedom. It's advisable to plan your visit well in advance, especially during peak tourist seasons, to secure your preferred tour options and times. You must purchase tickets in advance to visit the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. You can do this online through the official website of the National Park Service or through authorized vendors. There are various ticket options, including Crown access, Pedestal access, and Reserve tickets. Be sure to choose the one that suits your interests and preferences. Ferries to Liberty Island and Ellis Island depart from Battery Park in Manhattan and Liberty State Park in New Jersey. Most visitors depart from Battery Park, which offers the closest proximity to the statue. Upon arrival on Liberty Island, you can explore the island and get up close to the Statue of Liberty. Take time to walk around, take photos, and enjoy the views of Manhattan and New Jersey from the island's grounds. Many tours include a visit to Ellis Island, which was once the primary immigrant processing station in the United States. The Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration offers a comprehensive look at the immigrant experience. There are food concessions on Liberty Island and Ellis Island, where you can purchase snacks and meals. Restrooms and gift shops are also available on both islands. Note: Entry into the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island and many other things on this list are included in the New York Go City Sightseeing Pass. It's worth checking out for your first trip! Photo by Robert Bye on Unsplash Brooklyn Bridge Visiting the Brooklyn Bridge is a famous and iconic experience for tourists and locals alike. The Brooklyn Bridge connects Manhattan and Brooklyn, providing stunning views of the city skyline and the East River. Walking across the Brooklyn Bridge is a wonderful way to take in the city's beauty, experience a piece of its history, and enjoy the unique charm of both Manhattan and Brooklyn. It's a memorable and picturesque activity that you can easily combine with exploring the neighborhoods on either side of the bridge. The bridge has a designated pedestrian walkway and a separate bike lane. Be mindful of cyclists and stay within the pedestrian area. You can rent bikes in Brooklyn or Manhattan if you prefer to bike across. It is approximately 1.1 miles (1.8 km) long and takes about 25-30 minutes to walk across leisurely. Plan some extra time for stops to take pictures and enjoy the views! Want other options?"}]}

Planning a trip to NYC can definitely be overwhelming. There is so much to do and see, that it can be frustrating trying to fit it all into one trip, especially if you only have 4 days in New York. I grew up in the suburbs, just 30 minutes outside of New York City, and have now lived here for many years. I think it's safe to say that I consider myself a local at this point. Before you dive in, I want to caveat this post by saying that I've put off writing a new york city itinerary for years since there are just so many things to do in this hectic city that I call home, that this kind of itinerary can be different for everyone. Instead, what I've put together is a mix of my favorite tourist highlights as well as the best cheap hole-in-the-wall restaurants, exactly how I'd like to spend 4 days in New York. Keep on reading to discover my local's guide to spending 4 days in NYC! You can mix and match the days below to fit any itinerary, especially if you have more time to explore. What to Pack for 4 Days in New York What you pack for a 4 day trip to New York is going to greatly depend on which season you are visiting. However, regardless of the season, there are a few essentials that should always be on your list. Good walking shoes - NY is a walking city, so you can expect to spend a good portion of your four days in New York doing a ton of walking. Make sure you have practical shoes for long days of exploring. I love my Birkenstocks for summer. External battery pack - this itinerary is jam-packed, so the last thing that you'll want is for your cell phone battery to run out halfway through the day. An external battery pack is a must for any trip to NY, or really just about any trip you take. Versatile outfits - when you're packing for New York, you'll want to think about outfits that can be dressed up or down, by throwing over a jean jacket or popping on some heels. The same dress could be worn casually for a day of exploring, and then dressed up for a night out in the city. Sweater or light jacket - no matter what the season, you're looking to want to pack layers. Even during the summers, rooftops can get chilly in the evenings if the wind picks up. Backpack - I always recommend packing a good bag or backpack for any trip to NYC. As I mentioned, the days on my 4 day New York itinerary are long, so you'll want to be able to carry around everything you need. My go-to is my Patagonia day pack. Camera - NYC is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Don't miss out on an opportunity to snap some photos. I have the Sony a7ii and I love it! Before you dive in, make sure out some of the most popular tours in NYC: 1 Day New York Sightseeing Tour SUMMIT One Experience Edge Observation Deck Admission New York Helicopter Tour 9/11 Memorial Museum Admission Ticket Itinerary for 4 Days in New York City New York Itinerary Day 1: Exploring from Midtown to Uptown 4 Day NYC Itinerary: Top of the Rock View from Top of the Rock in NYC Top of the Rock Start the morning of your first of 4 days in New York at Top of the Rock. It's admittedly super touristy and a bit expensive, but it is so worth it for the views. I recommend booking your tickets ahead of time and arriving right when it opens, usually around 8am, to beat the crowds. The Empire State Building The Empire State Building is another good alternative, with the newly renovated 102nd floor, but Top of the Rock has slightly better views in my opinion (as you can see the Empire State Building). If you're looking to book a visit to the Empire State Building, then you'll want to do the 86th and 102nd floor combo, with tickets priced at $75. Book your tickets here | Visiting a lot of attractions in New York? With the New York Explorer Pass by Go City you get access to your favorite 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 10 attractions or tours, from over 95 things to do, and save up to 40% (compared to buying individual attraction tickets). Admire sweeping views from the Empire State Building Observatory, Top of the Rock, Edge and One World Observatory. See the city from a Hop on Hop off Bus, or take a Sightseeing Cruise. There's something for everyone! Empire State Building 102nd Floor View from the Empire State Building Grand Central Station, Bryant Park, and New York Public Library Backtrack a bit after your early morning to explore a number of NYC musts: Grand Central Station, Bryant Park, and the New York Public Library. While it would make sense to stop here before heading a bit north to Top of the Rock or the Empire State Building, I recommend visiting these top attractions early, and then you can backtrack if you want to avoid the crowds. Otherwise you can start your morning here and make your way Uptown. Times Square While you're in Midtown, this is also a good opportunity for a quick stop in Times Square. Most locals avoid Times Square at all costs, unless they are going to a Broadway performance. That being said, it is an iconic New York City spot that you shouldn't miss. If you have the opportunity to return in the late evening, when the city is lit up, I definitely recommend it. Photo credit: Booking. Com 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge A gorgeous hotel in Brooklyn's charming DUMBO neighborhood? Check. A rooftop pool with the perfect Manhattan skyline view? Check. An incredible restaurant and bar? Check. 1 Hotel is my go-to NYC hotel stay. Check rates and availability Museum of Modern Art (MoMa) My absolute favorite museum in NYC is the Museum of Modern Art (MoMa) so I would definitely stop here next if you're interested in art. If you're visiting during winter then it's a perfect opportunity to warm up a bit inside. Make sure to check out the gift shop as well for some unique souvenirs. Another great option is the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Book your tickets here Central Park during Fall Boat Rides in Central Park Central Park The next stop on the first day of your 4 days in New York is Central Park. Central Park is one of my absolute favorites places in NYC. It is truly enjoyable in any season. You could spend all day exploring Central Park, whether you're basking in the sun or taking in the fall foliage, but here are a few tips: Enter at 5th Avenue (just across from The Plaza Hotel) and wander around The Pond and Gapstow Bridge From here, make your way North towards Bethesda Fountain and Bow Bridge If the weather allows, go for a boat ride at the Loeb Boathouse ($15 cash + $20 cash deposit for 1 hour) If you're planning on laying out or having a picnic, I recommend Sheep's Meadow There aren't many public bathrooms in Central Park. but if you need to go you'll one a public restroom right behind Le Pain Quotidien, located by Sheep's Meadow Upper West Side Once you've had your fill of Central Park, make you way to the Upper West Side for a stroll and a meal. My personal favorites include The Mermaid Inn, Han Dynasty, and the famous Carmine's Restaurant (if you're traveling with a group). The Mermaid Inn is great for a drink and a great oyster happy hour. Han Dynasty is a classic Chinese restaurant, great for family style meals. And Carmine's is a NYC classic, with oversized portions great for any celebrations. Their penne alla vodka is unbeatable!If you're on a budget that you'll find a list of the best cheap eats in NYC here. New York Itinerary Day 2: Brooklyn Brooklyn Bridge No 4 day trip to New York City is complete without a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge - but do yourself a favor and do it early! This is one of the best free things to do in New Yor k! The bridge gets extremely busy during the day, both with tourists and New York locals. Arrive shortly after sunrise (or during for great views), and you'll find a relatively empty bridge. Both of these shots were taken shortly after sunrise. Although the views are slightly better walking towards Manhattan, I recommend starting on the NYC side and making your way across to Brooklyn. You can always turn around for Downtown Manhattan views. For the easiest access take the 4/5/6 subway to Brooklyn Bridge - City Hall station. If you're starting on the Brooklyn side then take the F to York street station. Make sure to watch out for bikers and commuters while on the path! Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge The Brooklyn Bridge at sunrise DUMBO Once across the bridge you can explore DUMBO, a neighborhood named after its location down under the Manhattan Bridge overpass. Head to Washington and Water St to snap a photo at the famous NYC Instagram spot, before wandering down to the water. You'll find some great spots to eat in DUMBO, such as the Time Out Market and Grimaldi's Pizza. Even if you don't want to eat there, I recommend heading to the rooftop at the Time Out Market for some excellent views of the bridge (free to access). Another great rooftop is the One Hotel. The drinks are on the pricier end but well worth it for the excellent views! Washington Street in DUMBO, Brooklyn DUMBO, Brooklyn Brooklyn Heights + Cobble Hill Once you've had your fill of DUMBO, continue walking down the water through Brooklyn Bridge Park to experience neighborhoods of Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill for some Brooklyn charm. Admire the Brooklyn brownstones and the neighborhood shops on Court and Smith streets. A few highlights in the area include: Drinks in Brooklyn: Elsa Cocktail Bar (handcrafted cocktails and excellent wine) Black Mountain Wine House (cozy cabin vibes with an excellent, and affordable, wine selection) Swallow Cafe (hot drinks and treats for an afternoon pick me up) Food in Brooklyn: Lucali Pizza (one of NYC's best pizza spots - arrive right when it opens to snag a seat) Colonie (my favorite restaurant in NYC, you need to order the Sticky Date cake) Brooklyn Farmacy & Soda Fountain (extravagant ice cream sundaes with old time Brooklyn charm) Vinny's of Carroll Gardens (classic, no-frills Italian food) Sahadi's (international market with an excellent prepared foods section) Brooklyn Heights in Brooklyn, NY Cobble Hill in Brooklyn, NY Williamsburg Next stop is Brooklyn's trendiest neighborhood: Williamsburg. Hop on the G train and scoot on over to Williamsburg. There's plenty to do in Williamsburg, whether you're checking out the shops, looking for a snack, or grabbing a drink. You can definitely spend an afternoon exploring the trendy coffee shops and boutique stores, but I definitely recommend a night out in Williamsburg as well! One item that must be on your Williamsburg itinerary is a slice of pizza from Joe's Pizza. A true new yorker knows that nothing can compete with a New York slice of pizza. I recommend the Sicilian, or staying traditional with a \"plain slice\". Enjoying Joe's Pizza Exploring Williamsburg in Brooklyn, NY If you're visiting during the warmer months and happen to be in the area on a Saturday then I recommend checking out Smorgasburg for a fun dining experience. Just make sure that you save room for dessert. From here you can shop for some local goods at Artists & Fleas. If not, no worries! Here is a list of some of my favorite spots in the area: Brooklyn Brewery (a taste of a local brewery) Cafe Mogador (Moroccan restaurant - perfect for any meal but brunch is a personal fave) Radegast Hall & Biergarten (perfect for groups and casual beers) Fresh Kills Bar (come for the happy hour cocktails) Berry Park (the perfect Williamsburg rooftop bar + restaurant) Sunset views in Lower Manhattan 4 Days in New York City: Day 3 Exploring Downtown Manhattan There is so much to do in Downtown Manhattan that it definitely deserves it's own day on this 4 days in New York itinerary. The Vessel Start your 3rd day of exploring at one NYC's newer attractions: The Vessel. While same-day tickets are available, I recommend booking them ahead of time online. Once you've had your fill of the interactive art exhibit (I still don't quite get it) and the neighboring Hudson Yards mall, make your way to the High Line. The High Line, a park on a raised subway track, is easily one of my favorite things to do in New York in any season, and always the first thing that I recommend to anyone visiting New York. The Vessel - a must on any 4 day New York itinerary Early mornings at the Vessel High Line Make your way down the High Line until you reach Chelsea Market. This is the perfect spot to stop for a snack and shop, with a number of boutique shops and restaurants. Once you're recharged, head over to the Whitney Museum. This is must for any art lovers. Plus, the roofdeck views of the city and the Hudson River are perfect. Wander through the trendy Meatpacking District and then continue to Greenwich Village and the West Village -- exploring the cute neighborhoods and storefronts. If you don't have time to add a trip to Williamsburg to your NYC itinerary, then you have a second chance at grabbing a slice of my favorite, Joe's Pizza, in the West Village. Washington Square Park at sunrise West Village, NY SoHo Be sure to stop by Washington Square Park for a classic NYC experience, before heading downtown a little further to SoHo. SoHo is fun for shopping and small cobblestone streets. For a high-end dining experience in SoHo I recommend a meal at Balthazar. The menu is $$$ but an amazing meal to splurge on. Visiting Chinatown during 4 days in New York Dining at Souvlaki GR on the Lower East Side For those of you who aren't splurging at Balthazar, finish you day with dinner in Chinatown, the East Village, or the LES - all fun, local areas. For a cheap, delicious meal in Chinatown I recommend the following: Nom Wah Tea Parlor (oldest dim sum parlor in NYC - be sure to check out the speakeasy next door as well) Vanessa's Dumpling (a great spot for cheap takeout dumplings) A few of my favorite spots in the East Village/LES include the following: Jajaja Mexican (I never knew how good vegan Mexican could be) Souvlaki GR (transport yourself to Santorini with this hidden Greek gem) Panna ii (where Christmas lights meet chili peppers.. and Indian food) If you're sticking around the area to check out some bars, then I recommend the following spots: Lois (East Village) Pianos (LES) Please Don't Tell (East Village) Ten Degrees (East Village) A Local's Guide to NYC: Exploring (Way) Downtown Manhattan Although most locals avoid way downtown Manhattan, other than to go to the office, there are some great things to see. Take the subway (or walk) down to Wall Street and wander the streets a bit to get a taste of New York's Financial District (FiDi) and the New York Stock Exchange. Choices for food can be a bit limited in this area, but you can never go wrong with a meal at Westville. Classic dishes at reasonable prices, plus a great happy hour at the Wall St location. I definitely recommend checking out the One World Trade (Freedom Tower), as well as the 9/11 Memorial and Museum if time permits. Wander down to Battery Park. Pro tip: from here you can take the Staten Island Ferry for a very cheap way to see the Statue of Liberty up close Views of the Freedom Tower Evening views of Lower Manhattan A Local's Guide to Queens I know that I've already used up my 4 days in New York, but as someone who has lived and worked in the area, it would feel wrong to not include it. While not the most famous parts of a NYC itinerary, you'll find some hidden gems in both Long Island City and Astoria. With so many awesome local breweries, I recommend enjoying a self-guided brewery tour. Big aLICe Rockaway Brewing Fifth Hammer LIC Beer Project Dutch Kills (for cocktails) Breakfast in Long Island City at Blackstar Bakery Big aLICe brewery in Long Island City, NY Just North of Long Island City you'll also find the hidden gem of Astoria. I'm bias because I lived here for two years, but I truly believe it's one of the best foodie neighborhoods in NYC. Here are a few of my favorite spots: Napoli's (classic, no-frills Italian) Taverna Kyclades (family-style Greek) Il Bambino (brunch and dinner paninis) Chip (NYC's best cookie shop) Sekend Sun (cocktail bars and tasty dishes) Marie's (dive bar with fun outdoor space) Astoria Bier and Cheese (perfect for a casual night out) I hope that you enjoyed my local's guide to NYC!

And also have enough time to explore different neighborhoods, try new foods, and see a Broadway show. We put together this 5 day New York City itinerary to help you have the best experience here. About this New York City Itinerary New York City is massive and the list of places to visit is long. We have been visiting New York City on a regular basis for the past 22 years. I went to graduate school in New Jersey and Tim and I would frequently day trip into the city. Since then, we try to visit New York City once a year, simply because we love this city. In fact, we even started and ended our around the world trip right here. To me, New York feels more like home than Baltimore, the city where I was born and raised. In general, I grouped sites together based on their location in order to save you time walking and using public transportation. This will keep you from spending unnecessary time on the subway and from backtracking through the city. You can do these days in any order. The provided walking distances are the amount of walking you will do to get between sites. These do not include the amount of walking you will do inside of museums, art galleries, etc. I do my best to keep the hours of operation and pricing up to date for each attraction, however, these can change at any time. I recommend getting updated hours and pricing for your dates of travel. The link to the official website is provided for each site.

One World Observatory One World Trade Center is the seventh tallest building in the world and the tallest building in the western hemisphere. This skyscraper stands next to the footprints of the original World Trade Center buildings that were destroyed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The One World Observatory, which is the observation deck on One World Trade Center, is a great place to take in your first view of New York City. From here, you have awesome views of Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and New Jersey. Plus, by being here early in the day, you get to beat the crowds and have a more pleasant experience. View from One World Observatory | 5 Day New York City Itinerary View looking east from One World Observatory | 5 Day New York City Itinerary Read about the entire experience and get tips on purchasing tickets in our post: How to Visit One World Observatory I recommend buying your tickets online in advance. If you purchase tickets online in advance, you will skip the ticket line but could still wait in line for the elevator to the Observatory. You have the option to pay more money to also skip the elevator to the Observation deck and the elevator back down to the lobby. You can also purchase skip-the-line-tickets through GetYourGuide (a great idea if they are sold out on the official website). Cost: tickets start at $44 Hours: Get updated hours here Getting Here: One World Trade Center is accessed from the World Trade Center station on the E line, the Rector Street Station on Line 1, the Fulton Street on Lines 4 and 5, or the Cortland Street Station on Line R. Powered by GetYourGuide 9/11 Memorial Plaza After your visit to the One World Observatory, spend some time at the 9/11 Memorial Plaza. The 9/11 Memorial Plaza is an 8-acre park where the World Trade Center Twin Towers once stood. The foundations of the Twin Towers have been converted into reflecting pools and the surrounding area is now a grove of trees. 9/11 Memorial and the Oculus | 5 Day New York City Itinerary 9/11 Memorial Museum At the 9/11 Memorial Museum, learn about the story of 9/11 through a series of exhibits, artifacts, and interactive technology. Website: www.911memorial.org Entrance Ticket: Entry tickets can also be purchased through GetYourGuide. The Oculus The Oculus, also called the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, is a brand new, state-of-the-art train station. It sits right around the corner from the World Trade Center. You know you are in the right spot when you see the brilliantly white, space-aged looking structure. The Oculus | 5 Day New York City Itinerary The Oculus opened in March 2016. It connects the PATH (trains from Newark and Hoboken, New Jersey) to the New York City subway system. It is also a shopping mall and a place to grab a bite to eat. It's worth a quick visit and it's free! Lunch at Pisillo Italian Panini Two blocks from the Oculus is a great little Italian sandwich shop. This is popular lunch spot for locals and business people working in the area. These sandwiches are enormous and can be split between two people. Wall Street On your way to Battery Park, wander through the Financial District and take a stroll down Wall Street. Staten Island Ferry A ride on the Staten Island Ferry is one of New York City's best free things to do. During this ride, you have great views of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline. The ferry leaves from the Staten Island Ferry terminal, next to Battery Park. Simply get in line and board the next ferry. The ferry is enormous, with multiple decks and inside and outside seating. I recommend taking a seat outside on the back of the ferry. From this point you can watch Manhattan slowly recede as you approach Staten Island. To your left will be the Statue of Liberty. View from the Staten Island Ferry | 5 Day New York City Itinerary Ferries leave every 30 minutes and are more frequent during rush hour. A one-way trip takes about 25 minutes. You are not permitted to stay on the ferry and ride it round trip. Once you are in Staten Island, exit the ferry, get back in line, and re-board the ferry. We were able to get right back onto the same ferry without having to wait for the next one (on a Monday morning in February). The entire round trip ride takes about one hour. Get the full details about the Staten Island ferry on the official website. Spend the Afternoon in SoHo SoHo is a neighborhood in Manhattan that is home to art galleries, trendy shops, and restaurants. It gets its name from its location \"South of Houston Street.\" Spend the afternoon wandering and shopping here. To get to SoHo from the Staten Island Ferry Terminal using the subway, walk to the Whitehall Street Station. Take the R line four stations uptown to Prince Street. For dinner, we highly recommend Piccola Cucina Osteria. This tiny restaurant serves traditional Sicilian food. We have eaten in Little Italy many times but this restaurant is so much better than any place in Little Italy. The food is amazing. It's a small place so I recommend making a reservation in advance. Soho | 5 Day New York City Itinerary For dessert, you have two options in the area. Just across the street from Piccola Cucina Osteria is Dominique Ansel Bakery. This bakery has unique desserts... How about trying a cookie baked in the shape of a cup and filled with milk? Yum! One block from Piccola Cucina Osteria is Black Tap, a restaurant that is legendary for its gigantic milkshakes topped with cookies, brownies, and even slices of pie. If you want to take a cool food photo on Instagram during your trip to NYC, this is a good place to put on your list. Expect to wait in line for at least 30 minutes. New York City Itinerary: Day 2 Art Museums, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square Walking distance: 4 miles plus Central Park (an additional 2 to 4 miles) Take Your Pick from Four Art Museums There are a bunch of fabulous art museums in Manhattan. Spend the morning in the one that sounds the most interesting to you. The Museum of Modern Art The Modern Museum of Art (MoMA) has one of the world's best collections of art from the 18th century to today. See The Starry Night by Van Gogh, The Persistence of Memory by Dali, and works of art by Matisse, Monet, and Picasso. Website: www.moma.org The Metropolitan Museum of Art The Met is enormous. It's so big that you can measure the size of this museum in acres (13 acres!!). Come see one of the best collections of ancient art from all around the world. Metropolitan Museum of Art | 5 Day New York City Itinerary Website: www.metmuseum.org The Guggenheim Museum This is another modern art museum. The building, which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is also a work of modern art. Inside the Guggenheim | 5 Day New York City Itinerary Website: www. Guggenheim.org The Frick Collection See world-class art by Vermeer, Renoir, and Rembrandt in a beautifully designed residence. IMPORTANT: The Frick Collection is currently closed for a renovation project although it is planned to reopen late in 2024. The works of art were relocated to a temporary location, called the Frick Madison, which is in the Marcel Breuer-designed modernist building at 945 Madison Avenue. Learn more here. Website: www. Frick.org Lunch Where you choose to have lunch depends upon the art museum you visit. If you chose the MoMA, here are two recommendations: Patsy's Italian Restaurant: This family-owned restaurant has been in business since 1944. Frank Sinatra made this place famous and many other celebrities have dined here, including Ben Stiller, Tom Hanks, Oprah Winfrey, James Gandolfini, and many more. I recommend the Eggplant Parmesan (it was the best I ever had!). The Black Tap: This restaurant serves craft burgers and beer but it's famous for its over-the-top milkshakes topped with brownies, cookies, and slices of cake and pie (mentioned under Day 1 as a dessert destination near SoHo). If you picked one of the other art museums, explore the area around the museum for lunch spots. Central Park Central Park is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world. Therefore a visit to New York City would not be complete without at least a quick stroll through part of the park. Central Park is much more than a tourist destination. For New Yorkers, this is a treasured green space, a spot to lie out in the sun, go for a run, and take the kids to the playground. Spend part of the afternoon exploring Central Park. You can simply wander through it on your own two feet, rent bikes and cycle a lap or two through the entire park, or do something very touristy and go for a horse and carriage ride. There are numerous places to rent bikes just outside of the park. We have the best luck one block south of the park around 5th and 6th avenue. You can also rent bikes in advance here. The Mall | 5 Day New York City Itinerary Central Park in mid-April | 5 Day New York City Itinerary Notable spots to visit in Central Park are the Imagine Mosaic at Strawberry Fields, Bow Bridge (one of the most photographed locations in the park), Belvedere Castle, Sheep Meadow, and The Mall. Explore Midtown Manhattan For the rest of the afternoon, stroll through midtown Manhattan. From Central Park, pop into The Plaza, one of the most famous hotels in the world. Then stroll down Fifth Avenue until you get to St. Patrick's Cathedral. Fifth Avenue St. Patrick's Cathedral | 5 Day New York City Itinerary Top of the Rock Observation Deck or SUMMIT One Vanderbilt Today, take your pick between two observation decks: Top of the Rock and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt. Of the two, SUMMIT One Vanderbilt is our favorite. You get one of the best views of Manhattan and it is a very unique experience, with the mirrored rooms and immersive art installations. Top of the Rock is also very nice, but it doesn't beat the view from SUMMIT. For photos of both, check out our Guide to NYC's Observation Decks. If you choose Top of the Rock, the best time to visit it is now, since it is located on top of Rockefeller Center. If you choose SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, plan your visit for the end of the day, when you are near Grand Central Terminal. Time your visit an hour before sunset for the best experience. From Top of the Rock, you get a great view of New York City from Midtown Manhattan. To the north you see Central Park, Harlem, and the Bronx. To the south, you not only get to see the Empire State Building, but you also get to see the towering skyscrapers of the financial district (and One World Trade Center) off in the distance. View from Top of the Rock in February 2018, before One Vanderbilt was constructed. While in the area, you can also take a tour of Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. Just note, if you do choose to take a tour, you will have to skip most of the activities planned this afternoon. Times Square From Rockefeller Center, it's just a five-minute walk to iconic, crowded, chaotic, touristy Times Square. Times Square | 5 Day New York City Itinerary This is one of the most famous intersections in the world. Every New Year's Eve, thousands people gather to watch the ball drop, making this the most famous place in the world to welcome in the New Year. During the other 364 days of the year, Times Square is almost as crowded, as street performers put on shows and visitors from around the world gawk at the millions of lights that adorn the neon billboards. It seems like Times Square is always changing. Every year, there are bigger and better billboards, new stores designed to draw visitors in, and crazier street performers on the streets. It is a crowded, overwhelming place and not everyone enjoys this experience. Take as long (or as little) as you like in this dazzling, gaudy place. PRO TRAVEL TIP: If this is your first time in New York City, it's worth seeing Times Square in the daytime and at nighttime. It really is neat to see all lit up at night. New York Public Library and Grand Central Station There are just a few more spots to visit on this very busy afternoon. From Times Square, walk to Bryant Park and the New York Public Library. The library is free and it is worth a quick visit. It's a beautiful building on the inside and has been featured in popular movies such as \"Ghostbusters,\" \"The Day after Tomorrow,\" and \"Sex and the City.\" Rose Reading Room the the NYC Public Library A few blocks from the library is Grand Central Terminal. This is the largest train station in the world, with 44 train platforms. The Main Concourse is a gorgeous spot to visit. Walk up the steps to the Apple Store and watch the show as hundreds of people crisscross the Main Concourse. Grand Central Terminal | 5 Day New York City Itinerary Inside of Grand Central Terminal is the Grand Central Market. This is a small market but it is a great place to put together a meal. With fresh fruits, pastas, cheese, and wine, you have the option to assemble a picnic dinner here. SUMMIT One Vanderbilt One Vanderbilt is the fourth tallest building in Manhattan. On the top three levels of One Vanderbilt is SUMMIT, New York City's newest observation deck. The views are spectacular but SUMMIT One Vanderbilt takes the experience to a whole different level. On these three floors is a state-of-the-art, fully immersive experience with art installations, mirrored rooms, glass sky boxes, and a glass elevator. SUMMIT One Vanderbilt | 5 Day New York City Itinerary Tickets start at $43 and a visit here typically lasts 2 hours. In my opinion, the best time to visit SUMMIT One Vanderbilt is an hour before sunset. SUMMIT One How to Visit SUMMIT One Vanderbilt: Photos, Tips & Is It Worth It? Everything you need to know to visit SUMMIT One Vanderbilt. End the day with dinner and drinks. If you like the idea of Japanese food, consider going to Momosan Ramen & Sake, just a few blocks from Grand Central Terminal and One Vanderbilt. New York City Itinerary: Day 3 The Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Tenement Museum & a Food Tour The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island If it's your first time in New York, the Statue of Liberty is a must see. You can visit just the Statue of Liberty or you can visit the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island together as a round trip excursion from Manhattan. Statue of Liberty | 5 Day New York City Itinerary At the Statue of Liberty, you can climb the base of the statue or go all of the way to the crown. Both of these options require advance tickets, and they do sell out, so make sure you book your tickets well in advance. Ellis Island was an immigrant inspection station and approximately 12 million immigrants were processed here between 1905 and 1954. Ellis Island | 5 Day New York City Itinerary Liberty Island (the location of the Statue of Liberty) and Ellis Island are connected by ferry with Battery Park (on Manhattan). The entire visit, from Battery Park to Liberty Island and Ellis Island, and then back to Battery Park, takes about 4 to 6 hours. You will take a ferry from Battery Park to Liberty Island. After seeing the Statue of Liberty, catch the next ferry to Ellis Island and tour this island. Then take a ferry back to Battery Park. PRO TRAVEL TIP: Tickets tend to sell out in advance. As soon as you know your travel dates, consider booking your Statue of Libery tickets. Cost: Tickets start at $25 Hours: Ferries depart from Battery Park from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm Website: Book your tickets in advance on www.statuecruises. Com Powered by GetYourGuide Tenement Museum Now that you learned about what it was like to be an immigrant arriving in the United States, continue the experience with a visit to the Tenement Museum. Located on the Lower East Side, learn about what it was like to live as an immigrant between the 19th and 21st centuries. Numerous tours are offered. Visit the Tenement Museum website for full details. To get to the Tenement Museum from Battery Park, walk to the Broad Street station and take line J uptown four stations to Delancey St/Essex St (8 minutes). Take a Food Tour in Manhattan Little Italy and Chinatown are places that are frequently listed in guidebooks. For years, we loved spending an afternoon wandering through Chinatown or dining at a restaurant in Little Italy. However, in recent years, things have changed. Now, most of the restaurants in Little Italy are mediocre, overpriced restaurants that are well worth skipping. On our most recent visit to New York, Tim and I stopped into one of these restaurants for a drink and even the wine was mediocre. Little Italy | 5 Day New York City Itinerary If you are curious about Little Italy and Chinatown, they are still worth a quick visit. But you should know that there are much better places in New York for quality Italian and Chinese food. A better way to spend the afternoon is to take a food tour in Manhattan. This 2-hour walking food tour of Hell's Kitchen gets rave reviews. If you like the idea of combining a walking tour with a food tour of Greenwich Village, I recommend taking a look at this tour. Finally, on this 3-hour food tour on the Lower East Side you will sample German, Dutch, Italian, Chinese, and Jewish dishes and hear stories about the immigrants who settled here. NIGHTLIFE IN MANHATTAN: If you want to go out for drinks, we recommend Death & Company. This speak-easy bar serves amazing craft cocktails. They also sell several cocktail books. We love Cocktail Codex (it's an essential cocktail book if you like to make mixed drinks). Their book called Death & Company: Modern Classic Cocktails also gets stellar reviews, but the recipes call for very specific liquors and infusions, and you would have to have a very well-stock bar to make many of these drinks. New York City Itinerary: Day 4 Brooklyn Walking distance: 4 miles Brooklyn is becoming one of New York City's hot spots to visit. With historic neighborhoods, a fabulous food scene, and some of the best views of the Manhattan skyline, this is a great place to add to your New York City itinerary. Since Brooklyn is so large, it's impossible to visit all of it in just one day. With just one day you can visit the neighborhood of Williamsburg and the areas along the East River. Think of today as a mini food tour combined with some of the best views of Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge. Dumbo (Down under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) Williamsburg, Brooklyn | 5 Day New York City Itinerary Walking across the Brooklyn Bridge The day starts in Williamsburg, a wonderful neighborhood with boutique shops, a variety of restaurants, and the Brooklyn Brewery. Then, take a ferry on the East River to Dumbo and the Brooklyn Bridge. From here, enjoy one of the best views of the Manhattan skyline, dine on the best pizza in the city, and end with a walk over the iconic Brooklyn Bridge. Get the full details in our article: One Perfect Day in Brooklyn New York City Itinerary: Day 5 Empire State Building, Chelsea Market, the High Line & Hudson Yards Walking distance 3 miles (if you include the option to visit Greenwich Village) Empire State Building Start the day with a trip up the Empire State Building.

The Empire State Building has been featured in over 250 TV shows and movies and is listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. Looking north from the Empire State Building (June 2021).

Get Your Guide: You can also purchase your entrance tickets in advance through GetYourGuide. Powered by GetYourGuide Chelsea Market From the Empire State Building, visit Chelsea Market for lunch. The Chelsea Market is food paradise!! This is one of our favorite places in Manhattan for lunch. Inside of the market are numerous small restaurants selling food from around the world. Our favorite restaurants are Los Tacos No. 1, the Lobster Place, and Takumi Taco. There are also a number of boutique shops if you like to go shopping. Chelsea Market | 5 Day New York City Itinerary How to Get to Chelsea Market from the Empire State Building: From the Empire State Building, it is a 3-minute walk to the 34 St - Herald Square Subway Station. Take the D train (orange) towards Coney Island. At W 4 St - Washington Square, transfer to E train (blue) towards Jamaica Center. Exit at 14 St/8 Ave and walk one block to Chelsea Market. This takes 16 minutes. Or, take a taxi, Uber, or Lyft. Optional: 9/11 Museum Workshop One block away from Chelsea Market is the Ground Zero Museum Workshop. This museum documents what life was like for the workers and firefighters at Ground Zero during the recovery effort. Filled with artifacts and photographs, this is a great museum to visit if you want to learn more about what it was like to be at the World Trade Center site after the terrorist attack. This is one of the most underrated museums in New York City and well worth your time. 9/11 Museum Workshop | 5 Day New York City Itinerary Website: Learn more about the museum here. Optional: Greenwich Village Spend an hour or two in Greenwich Village. Greenwich Village was the location of the 60's counterculture movements and the modern LGBT movement. Now, the \"bohemian days\" are long gone, due to rising housing costs and gentrification of the neighborhood, but this is still a wonderful spot to visit.

The High Line It's free to visit and one of Manhattan's prettiest walks.The High Line starts near the Whitney Museum, but you can also get onto the High Line from Chelsea Market. It takes about 30 minutes to walk from Chelsea Market to Hudson Yards. Hudson Yards, the Vessel, & the Edge Spend the rest of the day in the ultra-modern Hudson Yards. What was once a storage yard and jumble of train tracks has evolved into Manhattan's newest ultra-modern neighborhood. The trains and their tracks are still here, but this small city has been built on a state-of-the-art platform that is elevated above the railroad tracks. Glass-plated skyscrapers, a shopping mall, a performing arts theater, and two of Manhattan's very popular attractions, the Vessel and the Edge, can all be found here. The Vessel The Vessel is a futuristic art installation in Hudson Yards. After being closed for several years, it recently reopened at the end of 2024. The Vessel | 5 Day New York City Itinerary LEARN MORE: How to Visit the Vessel The Edge In 2020, The Edge joined the growing number of observation decks in Manhattan. Hovering 100 floors above the city streets, this sky deck offers jaw-dropping views over Manhattan. Adding to the thrill is the glass floor, where you can peer down to the city streets far below. The Edge | 5 Day New York City Itinerary The best time to visit the Edge is at sunset. These tickets sell out in advance, so make your reservations once you know your dates of travel. If you can't get sunset tickets, you can arrive mid to late afternoon and stick around for sunset. I also recommend checking GetYourGuide, because they are an authorized ticket seller for Hudson Yards and they might have availability for your date and time. There is also a new experience. Called City Climb, you wear a harness, climb up along the edge of the skyscraper, and view New York City from the highest observation deck in the city. This takes two hours and ends with a visit to the Edge. We did this in November 2021 and it is awesome! It's definitely the most thrilling view of Manhattan. For more information and photos, click the link below to read our Guide to the Edge and City Climb. Note: City Climb ends with a visit to the Edge sky deck. The City Climb experience takes 2 hours. If you book one of the last tours of the day, you can end with sunset views from the Edge. Cost: Tickets start at $40 for the Edge. There is an additional $10 to $20 fee for sunset tickets. For City Climb, tickets start at $185. Hours: 8 am to midnight Getting Here: From the Vessel, enter The Shops at Hudson Yards, which sit right next to the Vessel. Take the elevator to the 4th floor and follow signs to the Edge.

For a full list of things to do, check out our New York City Bucket List: 50 Best Things to Do in New York. Using the Subway To get around New York City, we recommend using the Subway. The New York City Subway is functional but it is dirty, smelly, and in great need of renovation work. It may not be pretty but it will get you where you need to go cheaply and efficiently. I recommend downloading the NYC Subway app on your smartphone (it's free!). This is the app I use to find routes between destinations. I also recommend purchasing a 7 Day Unlimited Ride Metrocard. It costs $34 and you can ride the subway an unlimited number of times in seven days (there is not a 5 day unlimited ride Metrocard). It costs $3.25 per ride on the metro. If you ride the metro 11 or more times (which you will do on this itinerary) the card pays for itself.

There are so many amazing restaurants in New York, that you should plan ahead if you can so you won't stress later. BUY Broadway show tix in advance! Research Broadway shows, comedy shows, or Lincoln Center performances that you may want to see on one of your NYC nights. Download the Today Tix app on your phone now and start searching for show tickets. Any choice you make will be a good one because NYC is the best theater town in the world. The theaters are pretty intimate, so don't feel pressured to buy the most expensive seats, you'll be able to see well from any part of the theater. Day One of 2 Days in NYC: Uptown This is your uptown day! The Uptown & Central Park neighborhoods include both the Upper East Side and Upper West Side. Known for upscale residences, elegant brownstones, and Museum Mile, these neighborhoods are filled with tree lined streets and have primary access to the stunning green space of Manhattan known as Central Park. Get ready to see some of the best stuff that NYC has to offer! Morning: Central Park & The Met Visit Central Park -Grab breakfast and start your morning off in every New Yorker's favorite park. The iconic Central Park has 842 acres of greenery, lakes, walking trails, and history. Take a guided walking tour or do it DIY to get acquainted with all there is to see and do here. Be sure to stop by the Bethesda Fountain, walk on the Mall, and stroll on the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir Running Path. Visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art- Exit the park at 81st St. and 5th Avenue to enter the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Open 7 days per week from 9:30 - 5:30 and 9PM on Fridays and Saturdays. With only 2 days in the city, you can't possibly visit all the museums and attractions, but the Met is non-negotiable in my book. The morning is the best time to go because it may be less crowded. Find your favorite section or head for the current exhibit. Be sure to enjoy the architecture as well as the art in this magnificent and world renowned museum. Book a Walking Tour of Central Park Here Afternoon: Lunch at The Plaza & Rockefeller Center & Empire State Building Lunch at The Plaza - When you leave the Met, walk south through the park and pass by the Central Park Zoo and walk along 5th Avenue until you reach the famed Pulitzer Fountain at Grand Army Plaza. Here, you'll enter the one and only Plaza Hotel. If you can get a table in the main dining room, The Palm Court, then do it! If not, The Champagne Bar will likely have a table and it is very lovely, with a great menu, perfect for your lunch at The Plaza with Eloise! Visit Rockefeller Center - After lunch, continue south on 5th Avenue for some window shopping until you hit 50th St. and see Rockefeller Center. You'll find the Atlas statue, the ice skating rink, the flags, the fountain, and can get a pic in front of Radio City Music Hall. If you have time, walk 20 more blocks (another 20 minutes) down 5th Avenue, passing the New York City Library at 42nd St. & 5th Avenue. before coming to the iconic Empire State Building at 34th St. & 5th Avenue. Both these landmarks are gorgeous inside and out. The Empire State Building however, requires tickets and time waiting in line, etc, so you may have to pass on this particular adventure for this trip, and catch it the next time! Evening: Midtown - Dinner in Times Square & Broadway Show Times Square - Continue on to 42nd St. & Broadway. You are now heading directly into Times Square. Hold on to your hat, and be prepared for a crowded, loud, and busy scene! If you've never been, it can be a bit overwhelming. Everywhere you look will be filled with lights and sounds and street performers. You'll see where the ball drops at New Year's Eve, the famous billboards, and you can climb the steps above the TKTS office to get a birds eye view of the square. Dinner Before the Show - Dos Caminos at 47th St. & Broadway for Mexican food. I always recommend this restaurant because the food is consistently great, there are always tables available, the prices are decent, and most of all because it's close to all the theaters. You can relax during dinner knowing that you're just steps away from your show. Head to the theater and enjoy the show! Check your tix for the show time, so you aren't late! After The Show Enjoy a New York tradition and have some drinks after the show. Here are some special places in the Theater District: Lillie's Victorian Establishment - 249 W 49th St. & Broadway - An antique laden Victorian themed bar named for actress Lillie Langtry. St. Cloud Rooftop Bar - 6 Times Sq. Broadway & 6th Ave. 17th Floor - A luxury rooftop bar in the sky! Bar 54 - 135 W 45th St. &6th Ave. - The top of the Hyatt Centric with river to river views. Day Two of 2 Days in NYC: Lower Manhattan Lower Manhattan is known for being the financial district (FiDi), which includes Wall Street and the New York Stock Exchange. This part of the city features historic landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, Battery Park, and the World Trade Center. I love how these neighborhoods blend modern skyscrapers with original cobblestone streets. This full day downtown will give you a great taste of what there is to see and do in the lower part of the island. Morning: Battery Park & The Statue of Liberty & Financial District (FiDi) Battery Park - Head to Battery Park along the New York Harbor to see the iconic Statue of Liberty. It's a special site to see for sure, but I don't think you need to take the time for the boat ride and tours during this brief visit. I suggest instead that you get a great view of her from the land. If you want to take the time to visit the statue then click here for more info. Wall St. - After soaking up the view, head to Wall St. & Broad St. to see the New York Stock Exchange Building. The opening bell is at 9:30 AM on weekdays. Visitors are not allowed inside but feel free to take photos in front with The Fearless Girl statue. She's a 4 foot statue made in 2017 to honor International Women's Day. Charging Bull - Next walk a few blocks to Bowling Green Park, at Morris St. for photos with the infamous Charging Bull statue. Fun Fact: In 1989 Arturo Di Modica placed the 7000 pound bronze bull in front of the Stock Exchange building. It was later moved to the Bowling Green spot because members of the Stock Exchange complained. In 2017, the Fearless Girl was placed staring down the nose of the Charging Bull, but then Di Modica complained! So, the Girl was moved to the front of the Stock Exchange. Afternoon: Lunch at the Oculus &The 9/11 Memorial & Museum & Freedom Tower Lunch at the Oculus - From the Charging Bull, take a 4 minute walk to the Oculus and the 9/11 Memorial Plaza. You'll find lunch (and bathrooms) in The Oculus, the shopping center and transportation hub designed by Santiago Calatrava, resembling a dove leaving a child's hands. Visit the 9/11 Memorial Plaza - Across from the Oculus is the plaza that honors the people killed on 9/11/2001 and in the World Trade Center bombing on 2/26/1993. It's lovely in both design and significance. Spend time at the twin reflecting pools surrounded by names of victims and find the Callery Pear tree, known as the Survivor Tree. This was the only living tree after 9/11 and was saved and replanted when the memorial site was completed. The memorial site is free and open to the public between 10 AM - 5 PM daily. The 9/11 Memorial Museum is open Thursday - Monday 10AM - 5PM. If you don't have time to visit the museum, not to worry, there's a lot to experience by just wandering around the area. Late Afternoon: Little Italy & Chinatown Be sure to have your walking shoes on to make the 25 minute walk, north along Center Street, to New York City's treasures of Little Italy and Chinatown. Yes, these neighborhoods are side by side and are a fun and uplifting compliment after visiting the Financial District. Chinatown - is centered between Mott Street, Bleecker Street, and Chatham Square. This is one of the oldest Chinatowns in the country. Expect to see many shops selling fruits and vegetables as well as fish and herbs. You may be approached by people selling handbags and other random items. Don't ever feel obligated to purchase anything if you don't want to. But take the opportunity to buy souvenirs if you choose. Little Italy - is centered around Mulberry St., adjacent to Chinatown. The large concentration of Italian immigrants moved here in the 1840's and the traditions remain very vibrant today. Enjoy the smells of food and the sounds of music. Of course, stop for some cannoli if you need a little pick me up. Extra Time? Add a trip to Chelsea for a stroll on the High Line or a snack at Pier 57! Evening: The West Village The West Village is the neighborhood known for its charming streets and historic brownstones. The Hudson River is to the west, Seventh Avenue South is to the east, 14th Street is to the north, and Houston Street is to the south. The West Village is the center of New York University campuses, has a bohemian atmosphere, and vibrant arts scene. You might be familiar with its history as a hub for artists, writers, and activists. From Chinatown, take a 30 minute, 1.5 mile, walk north on Mott Street heading toward Washington Square Park, with its landmark arch built in 1892, in the heart of Greenwich Village. The park will be bustling in the early evening. Look for the oldest tree in Manhattan in the northwest corner of the park. It's known as the Hangman's Elm and is over 300 years old! It's time for you to move towards your dinner spot. Choose from the following in this neighborhood: Lure Fishbar - 142 Mercer St. This is my favorite sushi restaurant in a great atmosphere. Waverly Inn - 16 Bank St. This is a cozy spot with great drinks and hearty American fare. Dante - 79 Macdougal St. This is an historic Italian cafe in the Village known for being the world's best bar. Lola Taverna - 210 6th Ave. Come here for some of the best Greek & Mediterranean food you'll ever have! Enjoy the evening continuing to wander the famous streets of Bleecker, MacDougal, and Prince. These spots were home to artists such as Bob Dylan and Jackson Pollack. You can also see the historic Federal style homes from the 1800's and find alleys where the wealthy kept their horse stables. Fun Facts: The Friends apartment building at 90 Bedford St. & Grove St. is the exterior of the show's famous apartments of our favorite Friends. Sex In The City's Carrie Bradshaw (not to be confused with me) apartment location at 64 Perry St. While the show had Carrie living at 245 E. 73rd St.,the exterior shots were actually in the Village. After Dinner: Downtown Speakeasies Manhattan has a secret nightlife hidden behind random doors. Check out a speakeasy for an after dinner drink. These are a couple of my favorites: The Back Room - 102 Norfolk St. Look for The Lower East Side Toy Company sign on a little gate, walk down the steps into the alley and then up a staircase with toy cars displayed on the landing. Look for Laurel & Hardy telling you to Be Quiet in the Alley. This door is the same hidden entrance from the original 1920's speakeasy. You'll enjoy your cocktails in tea cups while you sit on velvet sofas and listen to music. The Garret West - 7th & Bleeker St. Walk into the Five Guys Restaurant, but don't order anything because you're looking for the hidden staircase in the back. There you'll find a beautiful speakeasy club famous for its delicious cocktails. Where to stay in NYC I've pounded the pavement for you finding the safest places to stay in NYC.

Getting Around NYC On your 2 day trip to NYC, I suggest a combo of walking and ride shares. The subway is efficient, but it's fun to stay above ground to see more on such a short visit. Walking Around NYC Walking is the best way to get around NYC. It's fun, safe, and helps you experience the city more fully. NYC By Subway Subways are the most common and convenient way to get around NYC. A lot of the trains have been updated, which makes it a bit cleaner. But don't be surprised if you see some unsightly things down there. It can be pretty funky at times. Here are tips if you plan to ride the subway: PRO TIP #1: Download the official MY MTA App (Metropolitan Transit Authority) on your phone. You'll find maps and schedules for all the subways, bus, and rail systems. PRO TIP #2: With your Maps/GPS App on your phone, use the \"transit\" view to find exactly where the closest subway station is and which train to take to your destination. PRO TIP #3: Make sure you have your credit card loaded on your phone in your \"wallet.\" When you open that card, simply TAP the OMNY screen at the turnstile of the subway stop and it charges you. Just like that! PRO TIP #4: You can purchase a Metrocard card on your phone or at a subway station to use on buses also. Each ride costs $2.90, and a 7 day, unlimited ride card is $33. You can also swipe through the turnstile and pass the card to your travel partner behind you. Do that for up to 4 people. PRO TIP #5: If you download an OMNY card and use the same card or device for 12 rides in a week, the rest of the week is free. NYC By Uber, Lyft, Revel, or Taxi Ride share apps are great for getting around NYC, especially at night. Obviously, they're more expensive if you are alone, but when with a group of people, it's often more cost effective than paying for separate subway fares. PRO TIP #6: Load all the apps onto your phone in advance. Check prices for Uber, Lyft, and Revel to compare. Prices will vary a lot at different times of the day. Taxis are also available everywhere, but you have to hail one from the curb. If the cab light is on that means it's available. There's a Curb App available for download, but I've been told the cabs don't come as quickly as the other ride shares do. NYC By Ferry Another fun transportation choice for parts of the city is the ferry system. It only takes you to certain spots, which might not be part of your 2 day itinerary. But check it out if you want to add some boat rides to the trip. The NYC Ferries travel from Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island along the East River and Hudson River. You'll take the ferry when visiting The Statue of Liberty or taking a sunset cruise. City views are awesome from the river! PRO TIP #7: Download the NYC Ferry App by Hornblower onto your phone. You can buy ferry tix on your phone and get a QR code to be scanned as you board the boat. Best Time To Go To New York City I love New York all times of the year, but here are things to consider in your plans for a 2 day NYC itinerary: Mid June through Early July and Mid August through September are the most popular times to visit NYC. The warm, but not too hot weather is lovely. The middle of the summer can be pretty hot! Fall is ideal with temps in the 60's and 70' fahrenheit. The crowds are smaller, the sun is warm, the trees are turning, and the air is clear. November and December are the most festive season to visit New York. Enjoy all the winter pop-up activities, decorations, and of course, the New Year's Eve extravaganza! Check out The Things To Do In New York City At Christmas here! February and March are also fun because it's snowy, not very busy, and the prices are better! Bundle up with layers, and be prepared with umbrellas and all-weather shoes! Hope you enjoyed your 2 Day Itinerary for NYC! In a nutshell... From the towering skyscrapers of Lower Manhattan to the artistic vibe of the West Village and the serene beauty of Central Park, you've got a taste of the diverse and vibrant energy that makes New York City so special. Whether you're loving the culinary delights of Chinatown and Little Italy or exploring the museums of the Upper East Side, there's always something fun and exciting around every corner in NYC. Enjoy your adventure in the city that never sleeps, and don't forget to leave some time for those unexpected moments that make NYC unforgettable! xx, Carrie Carrie Green Zinn Carrie Green Zinn is the owner and author of Carrie Green Zinn - A Travel Blog, which helps travelers become inspired to explore and step out of their comfort zones.

As a first-time visitor to this amazing place, I can understand how intimidating planning for your NYC trip can be with so many activities and places to check out. So, I've put together an efficient NYC itinerary that is easy to follow for you, whether you're spending just a weekend in NYC, or a whole week or even more. Tips for visiting NYC for the first time How to get to Manhattan from the Airport Taking public transportation in NYC How much time should I spend in NYC? When is the best time to visit NYC? Where to stay in NYC The NYC Itinerary Day 1: The New York Essentials Day 2: Midtown Day 3: Museums and Central Park Day 4: Brooklyn, DUMBO, and Lower East Side Other things you can do in NYC Where to eat in NYC Is getting the New York Pass worth it? Tips for visiting NYC for the first time 1. Consider getting a travel pass to save money - There are many attractions to visit and do in NYC, which means you'll need to buy tickets. Getting a travel pass could ease the pain. Here are two travel passes you can consider: New York Pass by Go City - This is an all-inclusive pass that allows you to visit as many attractions as possible within the duration of your pass. I'd recommend this if you're an active traveler who wants to do everything. Go City New York Explorer Pass - On the other hand, if you want to take a slower approach and visit only select attractions, this is the pass for you. Explorer pass allows you to get discounts on selected attractions. I will go over in detail whether it's worth it to get these passes in the \" Is getting a travel pass worth it in New York? \" section below. Or, you can see attractions included in the passes to determine whether it's something you want to do. Book in advance for New York Pass holders: If you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an advanced booking is still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out. 2. Get the 7-day unlimited Metro pass or pay with OMNY - The easiest and most cost-effective way to get around NYC is by using public transport, or more specifically the subway. Read more on this in the public transportation section below! 3. Download the CityMapper App - the subway will sometimes have route diversion, outage, or just simply not running on certain days. It helps to have CityMapper handy as the app will warn you of these disruptions. 4. Download the NYC Google Maps to your phone - by this, I don't just mean download the Google Maps app. You can download the whole NYC map to your phone so you can peruse the map when you don't have data connections (you'll lose connections in certain spots while taking the subway). You'll also use less mobile data when browsing the maps! Here is how to download Maps to your phone. 5. Wear comfortable shoes meant for walking - I averaged 22,000 steps a day for the entire week I was in NYC. If it sounds like a lot, that's because it IS! So when I say comfortable shoes, I don't mean any flat shoes, I mean REAL comfortable shoes made for walking. I stupidly wore my Superga sneakers thinking I'd be okay... but by day 3, my feet were so swollen and in pain that I had to buy emergency walking shoes - a pair of Puma trainers with proper cushions for my sore feet. 6. Learn about the local quirks - Jaywalking, neighborhood nicknames, why the city steams, how to pronounce \"Houston\" (it's not like the city in Texas!)... I wrote an entire blog post with stories from my trip to NYC. Check it out! Wondering what those smoke stacks are? Find out in my NYC stories blog 7. Learn how to tip the American way - yes, I know, the tipping culture in the US baffles every visitor. It's confusing! But, you don't want to shortchange someone just because you disagree with this social norm. The most common instance where you'll need to tip is when eating at a restaurant. The general rule of thumb is to tip 20% for average service, 25% for great service, and 30% for exceptional service. You don't need to tip at establishments where the food is not served to you. Fast food, bakeries, bodegas, or dessert places are examples of these establishments, but it certainly would be nice if you felt the staff did an exceptional job. You also don't need to tip ride-sharing drivers (but again, it is always nice to), but you must tip taxi drivers. 8. Prices do not include sales tax - If you go to a store to buy something, be mindful that the price you see does not include tax. It will be added when you pay at the cashier. This applies to tours and tickets too! But you might be happy to know that clothing and shoes below US$100 are not subject to sales tax, so the price you see is what you'll pay for those items. 9. Learn the Manhattan grid system and areas - Manhattan contains 214 numbered east-west streets ranging from 1st to 228th, ascending from south to north. Generally speaking, Manhattan is divided into three parts: Uptown is anything north of 59th Street Midtown is from 14th to 59th Street Downtown is anything south of 14th Street. Then, the areas are further divided into neighborhoods with funky abbreviations, as I've talked about in my stories from my trip to NYC. I recommend watching this Manhattan Grid youtube video by Bright Trip to understand Manhattan better. 10. \"Downtown\" and \"Uptown\" can also refer to the direction of travel. For example, you'll say the train is going uptown if it's going north, and downtown if it's going south. 11. Wise Card worked super well in NYC - as well as the rest of the US, really. If you're an international visitor like myself, definitely get yourself a Wise Debit Card. You'll save the foreign transaction fee with it. I never had to use cash when I was in NYC and San Francisco ! How to get to Manhattan from the Airport using Public Transportation Getting to Manhattan from the airport greatly depends on where you're staying in Manhattan and which airport you're coming from. View of Manhattan from my flight landing in EWR 1. From Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) You could take public transport all the way to Manhattan, but I find it is easier to take Uber or Lyft from EWR to Newark Penn Station. From Newark Penn Station, you can either: If you're staying in Lower Manhattan, take the PATH train to World Trade Center, or If you're staying in Midtown, take the NEC/NJCL train to Penn Station on 34th Street Take whichever option is closest to your accommodation. Then you can resume via Metro to your accommodation. The last time I did this, it cost me US$21 for the Uber ride and US$2.75 to take the PATH train. Relatively affordable compared to other costs in NYC! NYC Path Train reminds me of MRT back in Singapore 2. From John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) If you're flying to JFK, you can consider the following options: If you're staying in Midtown, you'll want to take the AirTrain Red (US$ 8.25) to Jamaica Station and switch to Long Island Rail Road to Penn Station or Grand Central. If you're staying in Lower Manhattan, you can take Airtrain Green and switch to A train at Howard Beach Station. Again, take whichever option is closest to your accommodation. Then you can resume your journey via Metro. 3. From LaGuardia Airport (LGA) LaGuardia used to have a terrible reputation as one of the worst airports in America. Well, ever since the $8 billion renovation that was completed in 2022, they have shot up to be one of the best airports in the country! Here is how to get to Manhattan from LGA: If you're staying in Uptown Manhattan, take bus M60 If you're staying in Midtown, take the free Q70 bus to Queens, then resume your journey using the subway or Long Island Rail Road. How to take Public Transportation in NYC NYC is a city with great connectivity - their public transportation will take you to plenty of places easily. The subway is the best way to get around NYC, but you could take the bus, Taxi, or private hire via Uber or Lyft. Of course, if your main concern is saving money, you'll want to take the public transportation. Tip: The Big Bus hop-on hop-off 1-day ticket (worth $60) is included in the New York Pass A small convenience shop in the subway station Here are your options to pay for public transportation in NYC as a short-term tourist: Single-fare ticket / Pay-per-ride ($2.90) - A subway ride in NYC costs $2.90 for each ride regardless of distance, which I think is quite pricey. That's why when my 7-day pass ran out, I walked everywhere unless I was going somewhere far that was worthwhile for a subway ride. You can simply tap any contactless credit card at the turnstile, or purchase a ticket at a ticket vending machine in any subway station. 7-day Unlimited ride using MetroCard ($34) - You can buy the MetroCard from the vending machine at any subway station, which you can then reload. A 7-day unlimited Metro pass costs $34. Contactless payment with OMNY (capped at $34 from Mon-Sun) - OMNY stands for One Metro New York, the MTA's answer for contactless payment. With this method, you get to use your existing contactless debit or credit card. No additional actions are required on your part, just tap your card on the OMNY reader at the turnstile! You can also use your smart devices if you've added your card to it. When you use this method, you will not pay more than $34 in total fares from Monday and Sunday regardless how many rides you take. Unlimited MetroCard vs OMNY: Which one should I use for taking the subway in NYC? If you think you'll be taking less than 12 subway rides during your time in NYC, then it doesn't matter which one. You can buy a single-ride ticket or you can use OMNY. But, if you think you'll be taking more than 12 subway rides during your stay in NYC, you might be wondering... which payment method should you use? The answer is: It depends on exactly how long you'll be in NYC, the smart device you have, how much you plan to take public transportation, and your personal preference! So here's the deal - OMNY and the 7-day unlimited metro costs the same, but look closer and you'll notice that OMNY is capped only from Monday to Sunday, while the unlimited metro card is good for the next 7 days after activation. The seven-day period for OMNY weekly cap begins at midnight on Monday and ends at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday. Unlimited MetroCards expire at midnight on the 7th (or 30th) day from the day you activated it, regardless of the time you activated the card on the first day. For example, whether you bought and activated the unlimited card by taking a subway ride at 3 pm or 11 pm on Monday, then your card will expire on Sunday at midnight. Here are some tips to help you decide in terms of cost: Contactless payment with the OMNY method requires you to already have a card that supports contactless payment and/or a smart device that is compatible with contactless pay, such as an iPhone, Apple Watch, or Android phone. If you do not have these, then you'll be better off buying the unlimited MetroCard. If you're arriving in the latter half of the week (say Thursday or Friday), and you're planning to do more than 12 rides during your stay, then go with the 7-day Unlimited MetroCard. You just need to take the subway more than 12 times to make it worth it - that's less than twice a day, and trust me, you'll ride the subway more than that. If you're arriving earlier in the week (Monday to Wednesday) and plan to do more than 12 rides during your time in NYC, then go ahead and use OMNY! However, I personally prefer using OMNY because the benefits outweighs the potential extra costs. The OMNY method is more restrictive in terms of the weekly cap, but it's way more convenient for me to use, as I do not need to fuss with yet another card - I can just use my phone to tap into the subway. By the way, the unlimited MetroCard is refillable. If you decided to go with the MetroCard, don't throw away your card after you're done using it because you can always reload the card! Otherwise, you'll have to pay $1 for a new card. It also makes for a nice memorabilia for yourself - I still kept the MetroCard I used when I visited NYC for the first time over a decade ago:') How much time should I spend in NYC? If it's your first time in NYC and you want to see everything, I recommend spending at least 4 days here. But I have to warn you, it's not actually possible to see everything. There are so many things to see and do in NYC - I have stayed here for a week and still didn't run out of things to do. Or heck, I even have friends who have stayed in NYC for years and still finding out something new about the city! When is the best time to visit NYC? Spring and Fall are great times to be in NYC. Summer could get hot and humid and Winter can get very cold. I think April and May or September to November are great months to visit NYC. I visited NYC in May and September and can vouch that the weather was great in those months. However, if you're a fan of Christmas then you'll want to visit the city in December. The city would be decorated with beautiful Christmas lights and Christmas trees - it's truly a magical time to be in NYC. My very first-ever visit to NYC was in December and I still fondly remember that trip, even though it was over 15 years ago. Tip 1: The holiday market tour (worth $45) and Christmas Lights walking tour ($25) are included in the New York Pass if you are visiting during the holiday season! Where to stay in NYC If it's your first time in NYC, you'll want to stay in Manhattan - it will make your life much easier. However, accommodations in Manhattan do tend to be more expensive. I stayed in Manhattan both times I visited NYC. Here are some hotel recommendations I've stayed at: New York Hilton Midtown - I stayed here on my first-ever visit to NYC. While it's not the most beautiful hotel, it is part of history: it is where journalist examined the Pentagon Papers, where Donald Trump delivered his 2016 winning speech and most recently, the location where the CEO of UnitedHealthcare was fatally shot in December 2024, sending the country into a frenzy. But aside from that, it's also located within walking distance of Times Square, MoMA, Central Park, and best of all, right across from the OG Halal Guys cart! NoMo in SoHo - Located in SoHo, this hotel is within walking distance of many good restaurants and bars in NYC. It's also conveniently within walking distance of many subway stations. If you want to save some money, you could stay off Manhattan and stay in Brooklyn, but you'll probably spend more time and money commuting. You'll also want to stay near a train station if you don't stay in Manhattan. It's up to you which pro and con suits you better! The NYC Itinerary Overview OK, so we've talked about all the important things about visiting NYC. Time to talk about what to do in NYC! Below I've arranged daily itineraries you can do in NYC. Please note: you don't HAVE to do the itinerary in the same order as I've outlined below, however, I've grouped the activities and attractions that are close to each other so that they can be visited together. That's why I call this my efficient NYC itinerary! My NYC itinerary can be divided as follows: Day 1: The New York Essentials Day 2: Midtown Day 3: Museums and Central Park Day 4: Brooklyn, DUMBO, and Lower East Side Other things you can do in NYC To visualize this NYC itinerary better, I've created a Google Maps link that marks all the routes and landmarks I'll mention in this blog. Map of NYC Itinerary Save this map to your phone! If you are a Google user, click on the image of the map above. The map will then be saved to your \"Recent\" maps viewed. Click here for instructions on how to view the map later. It will work from your phone too. Day 1: The New York Essentials in Lower Manhattan As a first-timer in NYC, you'll want to start your visit by seeing all the must-see attractions. Let's do that today! Most of the attractions of today will be located in Lower Manhattan and within walking distance of each other. PS: The 9/11 Memorial Museum is closed on Tuesday. It's a place you must visit if you haven't, so I recommend doing this itinerary on other days that are not Tuesday. 1. Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island What's a first-time visit to NYC without visiting the Statue of Liberty? Of course, this is a must! Not only do you get to see the Lady Liberty up close, but you'll also get to take a little trip on a ferry to Ellis Island. Ellis Island was the entry point for many immigrants in the mid-1800s to early 1900s who shaped NYC into the city it is today. Make your way to Battery Park to board the ferry, which departs every 25 minutes from 9:25 am to 4:30 pm. Statue of Liberty Tip: Round trip ferry ticket to Ellis Island, entry to the Statue of Liberty, and admission to the Immigration Museum (worth $25) are included in the New York Pass. Book in advance for New York Pass holders: If you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an advanced booking is still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out. 2. Charging Bull and Fearless Girl at Wall Street Once you're done with Ellis Island and back at Battery Park, make your way down to the edge of the Financial District to see the Charging Bull, a famous bronze statue that is an iconic symbol of Wall Street, depicting the \"bull\" period of the stock market which means optimism and prosperity. This bull was first illegally dropped outside of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Wall Street by its artist, Arturo Di Monica, as part of guerilla art in 1989. The bull was then moved to its current location later that year. There is a tradition to rub the bull's... erm, scrotum when you visit, so you'll notice that part of the bull is lighter in color compared to the rest of its body. The statue has also been subject to vandalism, being painted blue during the financial crisis of 2008. After the bull, you can make your way to the Fearless Girl, a statue by Kirsten Visbal to promote female empowerment, which was installed in 2017 and was originally placed facing the Charging Bull. The placement of the statue caused some controversy and complaints from Di Monica as he feels that it changed the meaning and intention behind the Charging Bull. Since then, The Fearless Girl has been temporarily moved to face the NYSE building in 2018. As of 2025, the statue is still there, but it's unclear how long it will remain. The NYSE building Right across from the girl is none other than the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). If you invest your money in US stock exchange... well, this is where it all happens. Or used to, it's not as busy as frantic as it was back in its hey day as traders have transitioned into electronic trades, but there are still traders on the trading floor of NYSE. However, there is not much you can do here aside from observing from the outside. The building is not open to the public. However, if you arrive at the opening and closing of the trading hours (9:30 AM and 4 PM), you might just hear the iconic 10-second bell from the outside of the building. Tip: How Money Was Made: Wall Street Walking Tour is included in the New York Pass, worth $49. 2. Ground Zero, 9/11 Memorial and Museum Tip 1: The 9/11 museum is closed on Tuesdays! From the Wall Street, you can walk over to Ground Zero - the very site of the infamous 9/11 terrorist attack. Here, you can see two pools where the two World Trade Center towers used to stand, as well as a memorial that lists the names of all the victims of the attack. The 9/11 Museum is a MUST visit. The 9/11 incident has shaped NYC (and definitely the world) today. I personally think the museum did a spectacular job collecting photos, personal stories, and even soundbites from that fateful day. I didn't expect to cry in a museum, but there I was, sobbing in the middle of the memorial. Thankfully, I wasn't the only one crying. It was difficult to go through but necessary and very highly recommended. Tip: The 9/11 memorial, museum, and a tour are included in the New York Pass (worth $33) Book in advance for New York Pass holders: If you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an advanced booking is still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out. 3. The Oculus at One World Trade Center Once you're done with the museum, make your way to see The Oculus. Opened in 2016, you can't miss this white structure from the outside as it is very eye-catching. It looks like large wings on the outside, and once inside it looks like gigantic rib cages and a spine. The good news? The Oculus is not a ticketed attraction - it's a shopping center and a transport hub, and it's free to enter. You can go inside to take that iconic shot from the middle of the shopping center - it is truly something else. The Oculus from outside (Left) and inside (Right) 4. See the city from above NYC is known for its iconic skyline, so as a first-time visitor, you must visit one of the skyscrapers to enjoy the view. I recommend doing this closer to sunset so that you get a nice soft light that's perfect for photography. Take note that you might have to reserve if you come during peak hours. NYC as seen from Empire State Building Observatory There are many options if you want to see the city from above. Here are the options: Empire State Building Observatory - This building needs no introduction, it's the most iconic building in NYC. You have the option to go to the 86th floor or go even higher to the 102nd floor (though I think 86th is enough). Tickets cost $44-77 depending on which floor you want to go to. Top of The Rock Observatory at Rockefeller Center - Tickets cost $40. I think this is the best option to see NYC from above! One World Observatory - Tickets cost $53-63 depending on the package you choose. This observatory is the highest point in NYC, located on the 100-102nd floor of One World Trade Center. Edge in Hudson Yards - Tickets start from $38-42. This is one of the newer buildings in NYC. Summit One Vanderbilt - The only one on this list not covered by New York Pass. But you can still get your ticket ahead of time here for cheaper. Tickets for adults start at $39-45 via the online website, but they will add tax and processing fees and vary depending on the day and time of day. So it's still a few dollars cheaper to book through my link. For this itinerary, One World Observatory is the most convenient as you would already be in the area (It's right on top of the World Trade Center). But if you ask me for my opinion, Top of The Rock has the best view - you can see the Empire State Building and the entirety of Central Park from here, which are the landmarks you want to see when you visit NYC. Tip 1: If you're having issues choosing, you could consider getting New York Pass because ALL of the options above, except Summit One, are included in the New York Pass. You can visit even all of them if you want! Book in advance for New York Pass holders: If you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an advanced booking is still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out. Day 2: New York Landmarks in Midtown On this itinerary, you'll get to explore Midtown, which as the name might have implied... is the middle part of Manhattan, between Downtown and Uptown. Midtown is from anywhere between 14th to 59th Street. And you bet there is a lot to do here! You'll be walking plenty, so definitely put on your MOST comfortable shoes. 1. Best of NYC Cruise The Best of NYC Cruise is a 2.5-hour cruise that loops around the entire Manhattan island, starting from Pier 83. They have 4 cruise times a day in the summer, at 10 am, 12 pm, 1:30 pm, and 3:30 pm. In Winter, they only run the cruise once a day at 12pm. In Spring and Autumn, the cruise runs twice a day at 10 am and 1:30 pm. During the cruise, you'll see many of New York's most famous landmarks, including a few that are out of the way and first-time visitors wouldn't normally see, like the Yankee Stadium. It's a great way to kick off a busy day! 1 Tip: The cruise is included in New York Pass (worth $45 - 52 depending on the time of the year. Summer is the most expensive, winter is the least) 2. The Vessel After the tour, take a walk down to The Vessel - one of the newer attractions in NYC, built as part of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project. A few years ago, you would have seen The Vessel all over Instagram, with its unique architecture that resembles a honeycomb. The Vessel The Vessel is open from Friday to Sunday at 11AM to 7PM ( check opening times here) The Vessel from the lobby When I visited the Vessel in 2023, only the lobby was accessible, the other levels of the Vessel were not open to the public due to suicide cases that have happened too frequently since its opening in 2019 and again after it tried to reopen in 2021. In 2024, The Vessel had nets installed around it and once again open to the public. It costs $10 to enter. 3. Edge If you want to see the city from above, this is another chance! Edge is an observatory with 360 views from the 100th floor, which also includes an outdoor sky deck. It is one of the newer observatories in the city. 1 Tip: Admission to Edge (worth $40) is included in the New York Pass 4. High Line Park The High Line Park is a scenic 2.3km elevated trail built on a former New York Central Railroad. From Edge, the entrance to High Line Park is just a short walk away. You can enter the High Line park from the very beginning near the W 34 St & 12 Ave corner, or if you don't want to start from the very beginning, you can enter from the entrance next to the Bloomberg Building which would also be very convenient from the Edge. View from the High Line park The elevated platform means it's possible to have a nice peaceful walk through the city. For once, I was able to walk around in NYC without the anxiety that some biker is going to run me over or piss someone off for not knowing how to walk like a New Yorker. Walking from one end of the High Line park to the other should take about 20 minutes. Tip: Highline & Chelsea walking tour (worth $39) which covers this area is included in the New York Pass Book in advance for New York Pass holders: If you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an advanced booking is still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out. 5. Chelsea Market The High Line park goes over the Chelsea Market, so as soon as you see signs for Chelsea Market you can follow it down for some good food. And it's time for lunch! There are many options at Chelsea Market, but a crowd's favorite is Los Tacos No. 1. I can definitely vouch that it's worth a visit! You can read more about it in my food recommendations below. Los Tacos No. 1 in 2023 Los Tacos No. 1 when I went in 2018 6. Iconic buildings in Manhattan After you're done exploring Chelsea Market, walk over to the west side of Midtown, which should take about 20 minutes. Architecture buffs would be ecstatic about this part of the itinerary! I'll highlight three of the most popular buildings in NYC if you want to check them out, and in this exact order, for more efficient use of your time: Flatiron Building - You should already be familiar with this building. The name of this building gives away its shape - sharp triangular, like a flat iron. Chrysler Building - One of NYC's Art Deco skyscrapers with a distinctly pointed spire and arched crown. I was especially fond of this building as it is the location of one of my favorite video games - Parasite Eve. Empire State Building - This 102-story Art Deco skyscraper is a cultural icon that has appeared in many classic movies, most notably in the 1930s King Kong movie where Kong climbed the building. 1 Tip: If you'd like to go up to the Empire State Building, admission to the observatory (worth $44) is included in the New York Pass Book in advance for New York Pass holders: If you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an advanced booking is still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out. 7. Grand Central Terminal From the Empire State Building, The Grand Central Terminal is a mere few blocks away. Grand Central Terminal is a recognized National Historic Landmark. There are tons of things to see here, but here are my favorites: Main Concourse - Look up and you will see the 12 constellations painted in gold leaf on a Tiffany blue background. You can also check out the Apple store on the east balcony if you're an Apple fan, it is one of their most unique store locations. The Whispering Gallery - The ceramic arches next to Grand Central Oyster Bar are an acoustic phenomenon that will let you talk to other people on the opposite ends of the corner. Try it out with a friend! After checking out the whispering gallery, you can go to Grand Central Oyster Bar for some Clam Chowder. It is the oldest restaurant in Grand Central. At the dining concourse, there are plenty of food options too! You can get a burger from Shake Shack or try Magnolia Bakery 's famous banana pudding. Tip: Click here for more things to do at Grand Central Terminal. Grand Terminal Main Concourse Day 3: Museums and Central Park Now that you've done all the New York City essentials and must-sees, I thought it would be fun to highlight yet another different side of the city. We'll be visiting a few notable museums today. You'll still be walking a lot, but at a more chilled-out pace than the other days. Most of these museums are located in the upper east side, in the vicinity of Central Park, on a stretch of fifth avenue called \" Museum Mile \". I'll be recommending some museums to visit today, but of course, you can feel free to only go to the ones that interest you! While visiting all of them is possible, it would be quite a rushed visit to do in one day. Also, take notes on the days the museums are closed. Museums in NYC are usually closed for one day in the middle of the week. 1. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (The Guggenheim) Closure Day: The Guggenheim is closed on Tuesdays If you appreciate modern, contemporary art and architecture, you'll want to start your day at The Guggenheim. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, it has one of the most unique museum designs, spiraling upward in a cylindrical building, with artwork lining up the walls as you continue to walk up. Guggenheim Museum Guggenheim Museum The Guggenheim isn't a big museum and there aren't many permanent collections, so be sure to check what's on view to see if it interests you. I think the museum is worth checking out at least once for its unique architecture. Tip: Admission to Guggenheim Museum (worth $30) is included in the New York Pass 2. The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) Closure Day: The Met is closed on Wednesdays Just down the street from The Guggenheim is a name you should already be familiar with. The Met is known around the world not just for its annual star-studded Met Gala, but also for housing over two million artworks. I loved everything about this museum, especially the area that houses the Temple of Dendur. This area is formerly called the Sackler wing, but the name was removed after the Sackler family's role in making OxyContin addiction widespread in the US came to light. Temple of Dendur at The Met But the fact remains that it is such a beautiful, photogenic, and serene space. Definitely my favorite part of The Met. And if you're blessed with a good sunny day, don't miss The Cantor Roof Garden Bar on the rooftop of the museum. 3. American Museum of Natural History If you are interested in this museum and you're coming from the Met, I recommend walking through Central Park and visiting Belvedere Castle on the way (see my map itinerary!) Those of you who are interested in dinosaur fossils (YES, real ones!), animals, and gems could spend all day here. Take note that the museum is open every day from 10 am to 5:30 pm. Tip: Admission to the American Museum of Natural History (worth $30) is included in the New York Pass 4. New-York Historical Society Closure Day: The New-York Historical Society is closed on Mondays So I have a confession to make... I haven't actually been to the Museum of Natural History, and New-York Historical Society was partially to blame. You see, on my last visit to NYC, I was well on my way to visit the Museum of Natural History. New-York Historical Society is located right next to the Museum of Natural History. In my jetlagged state (I had just gotten off a 16-hour flight from Singapore), I walked straight into the New-York Historical Society and paid for the ticket right away, thinking it was the Museum of Natural History. I have no idea why I did that, even though the two museums look nothing alike and I even I knew there is supposed to be a very prominent dinosaur bone in the lobby. Long story short, I realized my mistake way too late and decided to go along with it anyway. A Picasso Tapestry at NY Historical Society Museum But you know what? I'm so glad I made that mistake! New-York Historical Society exceeded my expectations in so many ways. There were many interesting arts and paintings related to New York City, but the standouts for me were the replica of the oval room of the White House, the unexpected Picasso tapestry, and the large collection of breathtakingly beautiful and very priceless Tiffany lamps, made by Tiffany Studios (yes, THAT Tiffany). Gorgeous Tiffany Lamps at NY Historical Society Museum Gorgeous Tiffany Lamps at NY Historical Society Museum Gorgeous Tiffany Lamps! If you can, please make time for the FREE daily tour of the museum at 1 pm and 2:30 pm ( double check the tour time here). I got there just in time to join the tour and it greatly enhanced my experience visiting the museum. Tip: Admission to the New-York Historical Society (worth $24) is included in the New York Pass 5. Central Park The museums are already on the fringe of Central Park, so I don't need to tell you how to get there. Central Park is a massive park in the middle of Manhattan. And allegedly, it is the most filmed location in the world! View from Central Park There are tons of things to do here and the park is massive, but here are a few things I think are worth checking out at the park: Sakura / Cherry Blossom Trees - If you're visiting NYC in April or May, you will be interested in viewing the beautiful Cherry Blossom trees, because they will be in full bloom. Here is where to find the cherry blossom trees in Central Park. Bethesda Terrace - One of the many architectural features in Central Park. I'm a huge fan of the ceramic tiles that form a beautiful pattern on the ceiling of the terrace. Bethesda Terrace in Central Park John Lennon tribute - In the eastern part of Central Park is a small tribute to John Lennon. You can start at The Dakota on 72nd Street, where Lennon lived with Yoko Ono. It was at the entrance to the apartment that he was murdered in 1980. In front of The Dakota on the Central Park side, you'll find the Imagine Mozaic on the floor, a tribute to Lennon's most popular song, and Strawberry Fields, a tribute to The Beatles' song he wrote. Sheep Meadow - From Spring to Autumn, this meadow is filled with lush green grass, an excellent for a picnic with friends or a solo afternoon nap. An afternoon nap by myself at the Central Park 2 Tip: If you have the New York Pass, a Central Park bike tour (worth $52), a Central Park walking tour (worth $27), TV & movies tour (worth $36), and a bike rental (worth $46) is included. Book in advance for New York Pass holders: If you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an advanced booking is still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out. 6. Museum of Modern Arts (MoMA) Opening Hours: You'll be happy to know that unlike other museums, MoMA is open every day from 10:30pm to 5:30pm except on Thanksgiving and Christmas. From Central Park, head towards the South end of the park and you'll find MoMA just a few blocks down. MoMA is the mother of all modern and contemporary art museums, and it's a must-visit for all modern art fans. MoMA houses some of the most recognized artworks of our lifetime, including The Starry Night by Van Gogh, The Dance by Henri Matisse, Water Lillies by Monet, The Persistence of Memory by Dali, Campbell Soup by Andy Warhol as well as works by Picasso, Roy Lichtenstein, and Jackson Pollock. Tip: Admission to MoMA (worth $30) is included in the New York Pass Trying to see Starry Night at MoMA View of downtown NYC from MoMA 7. Times Square and Broadway Finally, when you're done with MoMA, it's time to walk over to Times Square at Broadway and 42nd Street. Times Square is arguably the most touristy yet must-visit site in Manhattan for first timers. Avoid going there during New Year's Eve, it's just not worth it when it's that crowded. Times Square is better to visit at night or as the sun is about to go down so that you can see all the billboards and LED signs lit up into the night. I recommend having some hot dogs straight from the street vendors at Times Square, not necessarily for their culinary value, but more for that quintessentially New York experience. Hot dogs were brought to NYC by German immigrants, in the form of push carts in the 1860s. In NYC, the sausages used are made from beef. Here is a cool photo I took at (almost) the same place in Times Square, a decade apart. Can you spot some differences? I took these photos of Times Square in 2008 (Left) vs 2018 (Right) Times Square is within the Theater District. If you have time, you must check out some Broadway shows while you're in the city. Hamilton, Lion King, Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, and Book of Mormon are some of the most popular shows. Tip: A Broadway and Times Square walking tour (worth $39) is included in the New York Pass Times Square Day 4: Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Lower East Side Congrats! you're pretty much almost done with all the must-sees in Manhattan. But you're not done with New York, nope! So it's time to leave Manhattan and cross over to the other side for a more chilled-out day of arts, food, and walks by the river. 1 Note: This itinerary is best to do on a Saturday Manhattan as seen from Brooklyn 1. Explore Williamsburg Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, filled with things to do and shops to check out. Some may say it's gentrified, but it's still fun to visit. You can start your way from Metropolitan Av station. Here are some recommendations on what to see and visit here. Quimby's Bookstore - Indie bookstore providing curated titles The City Reliquary - A small non-profit museum where you can see memorabilia of the city. They have both permanent and rotating exhibitions. See what's on at City Reliquary here. Joe's Pizza Mohammad Ali Mural - PS: Joe's Pizza is also not a bad place to grab a bite unless you're here on a Saturday in which case you'll want to check out Smorgasburg. Artists & Fleas - A marketplace for craft makers, where you can shop goods from local small businesses. Only open on weekends. Smorgasburg - If you're here on a Saturday, you might want to check out Smorgasburg, a large open-air food market that started at Williamsburg but has now opened up in many other locations in NYC. Domino Park - A nice park to chill by the east river Mona Lisa of Williamsburg - One of the most famous murals in Williamsburg. More street art - If you are interested in street art and murals, you can see more on my NYC map. 2. DUMBO From Williamsburg, you can continue to walk down south for 1 hour. If that sounds crazy, you could take the East River (ER) ferry from South Williamsburg to DUMBO for $2.75 and 12 minutes of your time - click here for the ferry route info. I say, take the ferry. What's DUMBO? Well, it's a cheeky abbreviation to describe the location: \" D own U nder the M anhattan B ridge O verpass\". By the way, NYC is full of these amazing acronyms! You can read my NYC stories post for more NYC anecdotes like this. In DUMBO, you must stop by to take one of these shots: That famous part of DUMBO It's the spot where you can see the Manhattan Bridge, along with the Empire state building perfectly framed in one of its lower arches. There will be tons of people here, but if you come early enough in the morning then I reckon you'll get a pretty nice photo without anyone in it. Aside from the viewpoint, there are also plenty of places to eat at DUMBO. My recommendation is Juliana's which is a very popular pizzeria (they don't sell their pizzas by the slice though, so you'll have to get a whole pie) or Shake Shack if you have yet to give it a try by now. 3. Walk on the Brooklyn Bridge back to Manhattan Once you're done exploring DUMBO, make your way to Brooklyn Bridge. If you have time, you can stroll along the river at Brooklyn Bridge Park first before going to the bridge itself. You'll get this nice view of the Brooklyn Bridge set against Manhattan. Brooklyn Bridge from Brooklyn Bridge Park Brooklyn Bridge is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the US, connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn. Most visitors walk or bike through the Brooklyn Bridge. You can walk across the bridge, which will take you approximately an hour, or you can rent a bike. Either way, there will be a lot of people on the walking platform! Pretzels at Brooklyn Bridge Tip: If you have the New York Pass, a Brooklyn Bridge, and DUMBO tour (worth $35), Brooklyn Bridge Bike Rental (worth $40), and Brooklyn Bridge Walking Tour (worth $27) are already included. 4. Explore the rest of Manhattan Once you've crossed the bridge, you'll find yourself in Lower Manhattan. From here, you can explore the rest of Manhattan according to your interest - I would suggest taking a look at Lower East Side and East Village. I've marked a bunch of restaurants, bars, and points of interest on my NYC map. Or, read on to find more things to do in NYC below! Other things you can do in NYC So you've combed my itinerary and have done everything you want to do in that itinerary. Well, fret not - NYC truly is a city that never sleeps. Here are a few more recommendations what you can do: Things to do in East Village and Lower East Side East Village and Lower East Side are two of Manhattan's most happening neighborhoods. Take your time to enjoy Manhattan's best food, art, and music scene, such as: Katz Deli - A famous deli serving Jewish American cuisine. You can read more about it in my food recommendations below. The Bowery Ballroom - Fans of indie music can catch a show at this intimate venue. See what's on at Bowery Ballroom The Back Room - One of the original speakeasies from the prohibition era still in operation today. They serve drinks in unassuming white tea cups, just like how people used to enjoy their poison of choice back in the prohibition days! McSorley's Old Ale House - A beer joint that has existed since 1854. You can only get either light or dark ale here, as well as some bar grubs (burgers, sandwiches and hotdogs). Ukrainian Village - A subsection of east village where you can find Ukrainian restraurants and businesses. Try Streecha and Veselka for comforting Ukrainian food, or go to The Ukrainian Museum to check out some pysanky (beautiful wax-painted eggs). Alphabet City - This area is a portion of the east village where the streets are named Avenue A, B, C, and D. You can see where it got the name right? You can find plenty of restaurants and bars here in Alphabet City. Pastrami on Rye from Katz Deli More things to do and places to visit in Manhattan Comedy Cellar in West Village - A comedy club in West Village. You won't know the lineup until you show up, but many famous comedians (such as Dave Chapelle) have been known to make a surprise appearance. It's considered to be the best comedy club in the country. Make reservations here. Sleep No More in Chelsea - The ultimate immersive theater experience, based on Shakespeare's Macbeth, that I can't describe with words. Even if I try, you'll likely have a different experience than me, due to the flexible \"choose your own adventure\" format of Sleep No More. You just have to experience it yourself and go with the flow. As it is located near Chelsea in Midtown, I would suggest fitting this on the Day 2 itinerary above. Buy tickets here. Hester Street Fair at various locations - If you are free on a Saturday, you can check out this open-air street fair, where you can hunt for food and vintage goodies. Check their website here. My mask and a ring I got from Sleep No More Amateur night at The Apollo in Harlem - This requires traveling uptown to Harlem and only happens on the first Thursday of the month, but it was worthwhile to make the trip out there! Similar to Comedy Cellar, you just never know which future superstar is making their debut night here, which has included names like Ella Fitzgerald, Stevie Wonders, Lauryn Hill, and Michael Jackson & The Jackson Five. Buy tickets here. Apollo Theater in Harlem Bohemian in NoHo - An exclusive restaurant in NoHo, located in Andy Warhol's former studio. You can only dine here if you know the name of someone who has been here before. Strand Bookstore in Union Square - A large bookstore specializing in used and rare books. The Django in Tribeca - A Jazz Bar in Roxy hotel. Good for drinks and live acts. Breakfast at Tiffany's at Blue Box Cafe - Fans of the jewelry brand would want to check this out. You can have high tea at a cute cafe fully decorated in that popular Tiffany Blue shade. Be sure to reserve a table here. Other things to do in New York Coney Island in Brooklyn - If you're visiting New York during summer, you can check out Coney Island in the southwestern part of Brooklyn. It features a whimsical seaside amusement park close to the beach, with games, food, and fairs. Brooklyn Bowl - A music venue combined with a bowling alley. You'll definitely have a great time here. Where and What to Eat in NYC There are many good places to eat in NYC, and I enjoyed eating my way through NYC during my stay. Here are a few standouts that I truly enjoyed during my stay: Los Tacos No.1 - Yes, I lined up for this. Yes, it is located in the extremely touristy Chelsea Market. But YES, it was so worth it. They only serve 4 types of tacos. I tried cactus (nopal) tacos for the first time here - while this was not my cup of tacos, I do recommend trying it at least once and highly recommend the other three tacos. Los Tacos No. 1 Levain Cookies - Worth. the. damn. hype. Just go get yourself their walnut chocolate chip cookie and you can thank me later. If there is a line, don't fret because it moves super fast... so there is no reason why you shouldn't go! I originally planned to buy the cookies and then walk over to Central Park to eat them, but let's be honest - they only lasted a few steps outside the bakery *mouth waters from thinking about their cookies*. The original branch is on the Upper West Side, but you can find Levain in many parts of NYC now. Levain Cookies - I think this was chocolate chip walnut American Jewish Deli - Comprising approximately 13% of NYC's population, the Jewish community in NYC is the largest in the world outside of Israel. The Jews immigrated to NYC from the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, and these immigrants created what is now known as a Jewish delicatessen (or deli for short). At these delis, you can find the classic pastrami on rye and my new-found love: Matzo ball soup, among other dishes - some of which are unique to Jewish Americans. I became obsessed with Matzo ball soup, so I hit up as many delis as I could. Here are a few delis that I loved when I was in NYC: Katz Deli (in Lower East Side)- This is the place that introduced me to Matzo ball soup, so they needed to be mentioned. The Harry Met Sally thing is pretty cool too, I guess Sarge's Deli (in Midtown)- Out of all the Jewish delis I tried, their pastrami sandwich is the best! They also have the most homely ambiance, and their Matzo ball is pretty good. 2nd Ave Deli (in Upper East Side) - OK, by now you guys have definitely caught on that I visited all the famous delis because of my Matzo ball soup obsession... and the one at 2nd Ave Deli was my favorite Matzo ball soup out of them all. It comes with carrots! and a choice of 3 types of carbs! Matzo Ball soup from 2nd Ave Deli Babka - A type of bread swirled with chocolate and cinnamon, popular with the Jewish community in eastern European countries. Many have said babka is the best sweet to get in NYC. Breads Bakery is a popular place to get Babka from in NYC. The Halal Guys on 53rd and 6th - Because you haven't been to NYC without tasting that magical secret white sauce, made popular by none other than the New York cabbies themselves. They have carts all over the city now, but the OG one is this one on 53rd and 6th. The original Halal Guys cart on 53rd and 6th av When I first visited New York City in 2008, I stayed at the Hilton at Midtown, which you can see in the background of the photo above. Each time we pass by this corner around dinner time, this one food cart would have a long line snaking out. So one night just before flying back, I decided to join the line - and then I understood why. Their gyro platter with the white and red sauce is SO delicious and relatively affordable for New York's price. I liked it so much that I hand-carried one plate on a flight back to LA for my family to try! But I'm warning you: Be careful of the red sauce - they are legit spicy. It was as good as I remembered Is getting a travel pass worth it in New York? The New York Pass allows you to visit as many attractions as possible during the duration of your pass. Sounds good? Well, it depends. I would only recommend this if you're the type of traveler who likes to move fast and want to see everything. If you follow my itinerary above, your New York Pass utilization could look like this (Prices last updated on January 2025): Day 1 Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island $25 9/11 Memorial & Museum $33 Top of the Rock Observatory $40 Day 2 Best of NYC Cruise $49 Edge $40 Chelsea and High Line Walking Tour $39 Empire State Building $44 Day 3 Guggenheim Museum $30 MoMA $30 Central Park Bike Tour $49 Total value $379 3-day New York Pass (-$259) Potential Savings $120 (All currency in this calculation is quoted in USD) And if you decide to take the Big Bus Tour on one of the days (worth $82), it would add even more to the total value of the pass to be $461. A 3-day pass costs $259 at the time of writing, so you could potentially save $120 to $202 with the New York Pass. Of course, this is all dependent on your ability to plan and use up the pass to its full potential. Even though the New York pass is available for up to 7 days, I would only advise getting the 3-day pass and doing as many things as possible during those days to make it truly worth it. However, if you decide that you want to chill and only visit a few select attractions, you can consider Go City New York Explorer Pass instead. You'll likely save money through this pass, provided you pick high-value attractions that cost $37 or more. The pass is valid for 60 days after activation so you can take your time. My recommendations for such attractions are: Top of the Rock - $40 Central Park Bike Tour - $52 Best of NYC cruise - $49 The vessel - $39 Edge - $42 High Line Tour - $39 Okay, that was one long post on everything I know about NYC! I hope this post has been useful to you. And as usual, if you have any questions, please feel free to comment below."}]}

More info: Disclosure. Planning a trip to New York City and looking for a doable itinerary for up to 7 days in NYC? This guide has got you covered! We recently spent a week in New York, and it took me about as much time to plan this trip as the time actually spent exploring... No kidding. Don't worry, though. By following this itinerary, you'll be able to plan a perfect trip in no time. New York City offers an overwhelming array of attractions, each more interesting than the other. This makes it quite challenging to plan your first visit. What are the must-sees? How do you group the attractions in the most efficient way? In other words, where do you even start to prepare your New York itinerary? To help you create a realistic plan for 7 days in New York, in this guide, I share our one-week NYC itinerary pretty much as we did it (+ avoiding our mistakes). It covers all the top attractions, but also several hidden gems and local favorites that will make your trip so much more memorable. PRO TIP: Book your NYC hotel as soon as you have your travel dates. The prices vary widely based on timing and availability and can skyrocket when the demand is high. Click here for the best deals, and if you find something you like, don't wait to book! One of the hotels we stayed at doubled in price just weeks before our trip, and another sold out. Where we stayed: We recommend staying in central Manhattan. We split our stay between Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Penn Station and Virgin Hotels New York City (to compare options and give better recommendations to our readers ;)). Fairfield Inn offers great value, while Virgin is a more luxurious, modern experience. Both have excellent locations, so it depends on your budget and style preference. For most days in this itinerary, you'll find a detailed, hour-by-hour plan based on our personal experience and exactly what we did in 7 days in NYC. To help you get a better idea of how everything fits together, we also created a map indicating all the mentioned spots and restaurant recommendations - see below. Good to know: One week is the perfect amount of time to explore the Big Apple at a comfortable pace. But if you have fewer days, you can easily adapt our itinerary for a 3, 4, 5, or 6-day trip by prioritizing must-see sights and adjusting based on your interests. You can swap attractions or even entire days to customize the itinerary to your preferences. PRO TIP: Check opening hours and days for attractions in advance. To avoid disappointment (and long lines), book your tickets ahead of time! You'll find helpful links throughout the itinerary for easy planning and reservations. How to use this map: Use your computer mouse (or fingers) to zoom in or out. Click on the icons to get more information about each place. Click the arrow on the top left corner for the index. Click the star next to the map's title to add it to your Google Maps account. To view the saved map on your smartphone or PC, open Google Maps, click the menu and go to 'Your Places'/'Maps'. If you want to print the map or see it in a bigger window, click on 'View larger map' in the top right corner. Here is our recommended New York 7-day itinerary: DAY 1 ARRIVAL + CHELSEA & HUDSON YARDS. Depending on what time you arrive in New York, you will likely not have a full day to explore. We recommend starting with a visit to Chelsea and Hudson Yards on the first day. It's within walking distance of central Manhattan (and hotels we recommended) and you can see the highlights here in just a few hours. But there is also enough to see and do if you have more time. Here are some places we recommend visiting on your first day in New York: Little Island, Pier 57 Rooftop Park, Chelsea Market, The High Line, Hudson Yards, Vessel, and the Edge. If you have extra time, you could also visit the Whitney Museum of American Art on this day. TIP: The Edge is one of the best viewing platforms in Manhattan and a great place to be around sunset. It can get quite busy here, so be sure to book your tickets in advance! If you want to start your NYC trip with a bang, consider the City Climb Skyscraping Experience at the Edge! Good to know: Chelsea Market is a great place for lunch or dinner - you will find everything here, from burgers and Asian food to some of the best tacos in NYC. Pier 57 has a small food court as well. We also indicated a few nice restaurants in this area on our map, but these will require reservations, definitely for dinner. READ ALSO: Best Observation Decks in New York The High Line. Chelsea Market. Little Island. Timing-wise, this is what your first day in NYC could look like (based on what we did): Arrive in NYC, check in at the hotel, etc. Make your way to the Hudson River (by taxi, subway, or on foot). 4 - 5 PM: Visit Pier 57 and its rooftop terrace and Little Island. 5 - 6 PM: Visit Chelsea Market and walk the entire length of the Highline. Plan some extra time if you want to have an early dinner! 6 - 6.15 PM: Hudson Yards, Vessel (photo stop). 6.30 - 7.30 PM: Edge ( book tickets in advance !). Dinner at Ci Siamo. Good to know: If you have just 5-6 days in New York and are looking for a shorter itinerary, or if you cannot visit all these places on day 1, this entire section could be easily incorporated in the late afternoon/evening on day 6 of our itinerary below. Location- and timing-wise, it's a perfect fit. The Edge has the most unique outdoor observation deck in Manhattan! Glass floor at the Edge viewing platform. Vessel at Hudson Yards. DAY 2 STATUE OF LIBERTY, FINANCIAL DISTRICT, WORLD TRADE CENTER. No New York itinerary could be complete without seeing the Statue of Liberty! A proper visit to Liberty Island and Ellis Island requires at least 4-5 hours, so start early and schedule enough time for it. You also have to book in advance! For more information on how to visit the Statue of Liberty, please see our detailed guide below. LEARN MORE: How to Visit the Statue Of Liberty from New York After you return to Manhattan, explore the Financial District and the landmarks of the World Trade Center. Some of the must-sees of the Financial District include Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange, and the famous Charging Bull. Afterward, check out the Trinity Church and also St. Paul's Chapel. At the World Trade Center, you really can't miss Ground Zero with 9/11 Memorial Pools and the impressive Oculus building. The 9/11 Memorial Museum is also absolutely worth a visit! But there is so much more to see here: FDNY Memorial Wall, The Sphere, St. Nicholas Church, etc. We did and highly recommend this amazing 9/11 Memorial Tour. It's one of the best tours we did in New York - we learned so much! Our tour also included skip-the-line tickets to the 9/11 Museum. If you plan to visit this museum on your own, be sure to book timed-entry tickets in advance! End your day with a visit to One World Observatory, the highest observation deck in New York. The 360° views are absolutely phenomenal! Also here, it's best to book your tickets in advance. Statue of Liberty and Manhattan skyline. Charging Bull at the Financial District. The Oculus at World Trade Center. This is what this day could look like, based exactly on what we did: 9 AM - 1 PM: Statue of Liberty. 1.30 - 2 PM: Charging Bull and lunch at Liberty Bagels. 2 - 3 PM: Financial District, Trinity Church. 3 - 5 PM: 9/11 Memorial Tour. 5 - 7 PM: 9/11 Memorial Museum (tickets were included with our tour). 7.15 - 8.15 PM: One World Observatory (we booked (flexible) tickets in advance). Dinner at EATALY NYC Downtown. Alternative suggestion: If you are not interested in spending half a day to visit the Statue of Liberty, you can also simply book a 1-hour sightseeing cruise. There are many options, but you must pay attention to the departure location! For this itinerary, we recommend this 'express' cruise from Pier 16, very close to the Financial District in Lower Manhattan. Bucket list: In this same area, you could also do a helicopter tour. It takes very little time (12-30 minutes depending on the options chosen), has many possible departure times, and is a great addition to any NYC itinerary. By far the best option for this itinerary is this highly-rated helicopter tour starting from Pier 6. Just be sure to book well in advance because it's extremely popular! We hesitated a bit too long and it was sold out for the time that suited us... Ground Zero Memorial at WTC. 9/11 Memorial Museum. Sunset view from One World Observation Deck. DAY 3 THE MET, CENTRAL PARK, 5TH AVENUE, TOP OF THE ROCK, TIMES SQUARE, BROADWAY SHOW. Next, it's time to explore Midtown Manhattan and the area around Central Park! We recommend starting your day with a short walk on the famous Museum Mile and visiting one of the museums. Plan to spend no more than 2-3 hours at a museum - your back will thank you and you will still have plenty of time for the rest of the places we recommend seeing on this day. By far the most impressive is the Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met). This museum is enormous, has the strangest (but amazing!) collection of a bit of everything, and it's overwhelming. We visited the MET with this 2-hour 'express tour' and were really glad to have a guide. We wouldn't have seen half as much on our own! Other options include the Guggenheim Museum or the American Museum of Natural History. The latter is especially great if visiting New York with a family. Both of these museums are included with the New York CityPASS. In the afternoon, explore the famous Central Park. This park is also immense, so we recommend concentrating on the southern part where all the famous spots are located. Some of the must-sees at Central Park include Belvedere Castle, Bethesda Terrace, Bow Bridge, and the boating lake. In winter, you can go ice skating at Wollman Rink. LEARN MORE: Top Places Not To Miss in Central Park Afterwards, do some window shopping on 5th Avenue and check out St. Patrick's Cathedral. Next, walk to Rockefeller Center and visit Top of The Rock. This observation deck is very centrally located and offers the best views in Manhattan. Of course, it would be nice to be here at sunset, but this will depend on the time of year. I wouldn't worry about it though - the views are spectacular at any time! But I highly recommend booking your tickets in advance ! Have an early dinner and end your day with a visit to the iconic Times Square and see a Broadway Show (see all the best options here and book tickets in advance !). We opted for The Lion King at Minskoff Theater, right at Times Square. The Met. Central Park. Bethesda Terrace in Central Park. This is what this day could look like, based on what we did: +-10 AM: Arrive at Museum Mile, see the Guggenheim Museum from the outside, and walk to the MET. 11 AM - 1 PM: Met Express guided tour. 1 - 1.30 PM. Lunch. To save time, you could have lunch at the MET. We bought some sandwiches at Sant Ambroeus Madison (very pricey but really good) and held a small picnic at Central Park. 1.30 - 4.30 PM: Central Park, 5th Avenue. 4.30 - 5.30 PM: Top of the Rock ( book timed-entry tickets !). Quick dinner - there are tons of restaurants and eateries in this area. 7 or 8 PM: Broadway Show ( check what's available and book in advance!). Times Square. If this sounds too rushed for you, you could also visit The Met without a tour. In that case, arrive at 10 AM, when it opens. Alternatively, spend less time at Central Park and/or 5th Avenue. There are also pedicab tours available at the park, if you don't want to walk as much. If you can book a show that starts at 8 PM (most shows start later on weekends), that will also give you more time for the other attractions during the day. View from the Top of The Rock. Rockefeller Center. Times Square. DAY 4 BROOKLYN, TENEMENT MUSEUM, LITTLE ITALY & CHINATOWN. With a week in New York, you should find some time to explore some local neighborhoods beyond the most popular tourist attractions. We opted for Brooklyn, Chinatown, and Little Italy since it's really easy to fit all of these together in a single day. Start your day with a walk from Manhattan over the iconic Brooklyn Bridge. The best place to access this bridge is just as you exit the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall subway station. We indicated it on our map. Once in Brooklyn, continue on the bridge as far as you can, and visit Brooklyn Heights. This is such a cool area, with trendy cafes and restaurants. You could stop for a coffee and some delicious pastries at L'Appartement 4F on Montague Street. Next, continue north on Brooklyn Heights Promenade and stop for pictures at Old Pier 1. For lunch, we recommend Time Out Market. They have a big food court with tons of restaurants and a beautiful rooftop terrace with stunning views over the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Skyline. Don't forget to take some pictures at the Dumbo - Manhattan Bridge Viewpoint before you leave Brooklyn! Next, walk over (a very noisy) Manhattan Bridge back to Manhattan. Here, we highly recommend visiting the Tenement Museum. Set inside an old tenement house, a visit here gives a unique look into over 100 years of New York City history. The museum can only be visited with a 1-hour guided tour. Each tour is a bit unique as it focuses on different families who lived here in different periods. We didn't book in advance and simply joined the next available tour. But if you want to be sure to do a specific tour at a specific time, I recommend making reservations on their website in advance. Afterward, explore the local neighborhoods like Chinatown and Little Italy. We booked this highly-rated Chinatown & Little Italy food tour. It's a great way to see the highlights of this unique part of Manhattan and at the same time try all kinds of foods from local eateries. If you do this tour at 5.30-7.30 PM as we did, you won't need dinner anymore! In the evening, you could visit the Empire State Building (or leave it for another day, e. G. day 6 in this itinerary). In any case, book tickets in advance or you risk wasting lots of time. We ended this day with some drinks at a rooftop bar at our hotel. Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Heights Promenade. DUMBO Manhattan Bridge View. This is what this day could look like, based on what we did: 10 - 11 AM: Brooklyn Bridge. 11 AM - 12 PM: Brooklyn Heights, Old Pier 1. 12 - 1 PM: Lunch at Time Out Market. 1 - 2.30 PM: More time to explore Brooklyn. 2.30 - 3 PM: Manhattan Bridge. 3 - 5 PM: Chinatown and Tenement Museum. 5.30 - 7 PM: Chinatown & Little Italy food tour. Evening: Empire State Building (optional, alternatively on day 6), or drinks at some rooftop bar. Good to know: If you want to see Brooklyn Bridge without too many crowds, you could start your day earlier. That would also give you more time in Brooklyn if you prefer to explore more, do some shopping, etc. A note on Brooklyn street art. We wanted to do a Bushwick street art tour in Brooklyn on this day. However, Brooklyn is huge and those tours run on a completely different side of the neighborhood which is easier to access from Manhattan. Plus, because of the time when these tours start, it's very difficult to fit this together on the same day as the Brooklyn Bridge area. So we did a street art tour on another day - see day 6 of our itinerary. Chinatown. Tenement Museum. Chinatown. DAY 5 MoMA, RADIO CITY or MADAME TUSSAUDS, GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL, SUMMIT ONE VANDERBILT. Today, we recommend going back to Midtown Manhattan (same area as on day 3) and exploring more. There is just so much to see and do here that you can easily fill another day here. We recommend starting your day with a visit to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Book the tickets for the earliest time slot and plan to spend about 2 hours. You won't see everything, but it's enough for the highlights. Afterwards, you could choose one of the following attractions: a Radio City Music Hall Backstage Tour or visit Madame Tussauds. There is time for lunch before or after this, depending on your preference and the tickets/tours you choose. We opted to visit the Radio City Music Hall, best known for its precision dancers Rockettes who perform on the Radio City Christmas Spectacular every holiday season. The building is an Art Deco masterpiece and is such an iconic NYC venue. It has hosted so many legendary concerts and major events like the Grammys and MTV Music Awards. We had no idea what to expect of this backstage tour, but it was really worth it! Afterward, visit the Grand Central Terminal (or you can also have lunch here). You can just check out the main hall and the Grand Central Clock, but there is much history and iconic places to discover! We booked The Official Grand Central Terminal Tour and were wowed by all the hidden treasures we would have never noticed on our own. Be sure to stop by The Campbell for some drinks! Finally, visit SUMMIT One Vanderbilt which is located just next to the station. This is one of the most modern and unique observation decks in Manhattan. Be sure to book tickets in advance and plan about 1.5-2 hours for a visit. Afterward, you could walk to Bryant Park and see the New York Public Library. There are also many restaurants in that area for dinner. The restaurant we chose in Bryant Park was really not great so, unfortunately, I can't recommend anything specific. Vincent van Gogh's \"The Starry Night\" at the MoMA. Radio City Music Hall. SUMMIT One Vanderbilt. This is what this day could look like, based on what we did: 10 AM - 12 PM: MoMA (tickets). 12.30 - 1.30 PM: Radio City Music Hall Backstage Tour. Lunch. 3 - 4.30 PM: The Official Grand Central Terminal Tour. 4.30 - 5 PM: Drinks at The Campbell. 5 - 7 PM: SUMMIT One Vanderbilt ( book timed tickets in advance !). Evening: Bryant Park, New York Public Library, and dinner. Alternatively, a Broadway show or a sports game - see below. Alternative suggestions: Depending on your choices and the places you decide to visit, this could be quite a full day, or not at all. For example, if you are not interested in Radio City and are happy to just quickly see the Grand Central Terminal without taking a tour, you could have plenty of time left in the late afternoon/early evening. So if you want to see another Broadway Show or maybe a sports game by the New York Yankees, Mets, Knicks, or Giants..., this day could be a good moment to fit it into your NYC itinerary. Grand Central Terminal. The Campbell Bar at Grand Central Terminal. Manhattan sunset view from SUMMIT One Vanderbilt. DAY 6 EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, FLATIRON, UNION SQUARE, BROOKLYN STREET ART, GREENWICH VILLAGE. Start this day at the Empire State Building. The most iconic skyscraper in New York, a visit here is really not to be missed! Book the earliest time slot to avoid the biggest crowds and upgrade to the 102nd floor for the most dazzling views in Manhattan. Afterward, walk south on 5th Avenue, pass Madison Square Park, Flatiron, and on to Union Square where you can also check out a local market. From here, take a subway to the Bushwick neighborhood in Brooklyn for a street art tour. It might look far but it's only 10-15 minutes by metro. You can have lunch in this quirky area too. After the tour, return to Manhattan and visit Washington Square. It's best known for the Washington Square Arch, but it's also just a really cool lively spot. On a nice sunny day, you will find many street entertainers here. Next, explore Greenwich Village. The 'Sex and the City' fans will want to see Carrie Bradshaw's House on Perry Street! This area is also great for boutique shopping. The rest of this day really depends on your interests. See further below for our suggestions. Views from the Empire State Building. The not-so-scary (but very cool) King Kong experience at the Empire State Building ;). Flatiron and Madison Square Park. This is what this day could look like, based on what we did: 9 - 10.15 AM: Empire State Building ( book tickets for the earliest time slot and arrive at least 10-15 minutes before it opens). 10.15 - 11.30 AM (can be done much quicker too): 5th Avenue, Madison Square Park, Flatiron, Union Square. 11.30 AM - 12.45 PM: Subway to Montrose Station and lunch in Brushwick. 1 - 2.30 PM: Bushwick Street Art Tour (or a graffiti workshop if you prefer). 2.30 - 3.30 PM: Back to Manhattan and walk to Washington Square. 3.30 - 4 PM: Greenwich Village. Late afternoon/evening: see recommendations below. Alternative suggestions: If you didn't have enough time to explore everything we suggested on day 1, you can easily do it here. The High Line, Little Island, and Chelsea Market are just a short walk away from Greenwich Village. Alternatively, explore SOHO, which is a shoppers' paradise with lots of designer boutiques and famous brand stores concentrated in a rather small area. Here you can also visit the Museum of Ice Cream. If you don't mind traveling further south for a photo, check out the Ghostbusters Headquarters, etc. Just as on day 5, this evening could also be used to see a show or a sports game. There is so much cool street art in Brooklyn. One of many street performers at Washington Square NYC Perry Street, Greenwich Village. DAY 7 If you have one more (half) day left in your New York itinerary, there are so many ways to fill it! You can visit more museums, like the American Museum of Natural History, or some fun attractions like the FRIENDS Experience... Book a helicopter tour, take a sunset sailing tour, do a Broadway behind-the-scenes tour, or join one or another tour of famous movie filming locations... There are literally hundreds of options! I recommend browsing around on this tour/ticket website for some ideas. Do something different, something that will make this New York trip even more memorable for you ! Here are a few additional suggestions for places beyond Manhattan, based on what we considered for our trip: Harlem and gospel concerts (half a day). If you have ever dreamt of visiting the Harlem neighborhood and attending its famous gospel concerts, then don't miss the chance! In that case, you will have to adjust your itinerary and move some days around because most choirs only sing on certain days of the week. Usually, on Sundays, but some also on Saturdays and Wednesdays. See here for the best tour options. Coney Island (half a day). Located in Brooklyn, about 1 hour by train from Manhattan, Coney Island is New York's beach destination. Here, you can enjoy sandy beaches, the iconic Riegelmann Boardwalk, the historic amusement park Luna Park, or Nathan's Famous hot dogs. With lively summer events and a vibrant atmosphere, Coney Island is a fun destination for those looking to experience a very different side of New York, especially in summer. In the winter holiday season, you can even find quirky excursions like this Dyker Heights Holiday Lights Bus Tour... Niagara Falls (a VERY long day trip or 2 days). Niagara Falls is one of the most popular day trip destinations from New York City and there are many highly-rated tours that can bring you there. However, keep in mind that an excursion like this will require a VERY long day, so if you decide to do it, don't leave it for the last day of your itinerary. Alternatively, consider a 2-day tour. Coney Island in Brooklyn. Central Perk Café at the FRIENDS Experience. Niagara Falls (American side). Some Practical Tips for Visiting NYC Here are a few practical tips to enjoy your week in New York and make the best of it: Consider flying to Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) - it's so much smaller than JFK and has a very easy and quick train connection directly to Penn Station. Stay in central Manhattan. It will make everything so much easier! We stayed at the Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott New York Midtown Manhattan/Penn Station and also at Virgin Hotels New York City. The location of both of these is excellent. Use the subway for longer distances. It's so easy and quick. Plus, you don't have to worry about the tickets - just scan your credit card or smartphone wallet at the entrance and that's it. Book as much as possible in advance! It will save you so much time everywhere. Join a few guided tours! We did quite a few guided tours in New York, and they made the trip so much more special. There is nothing like having a local guide with you! TIP - We booked most of the guided tours for this trip via Walks. We have been on dozens of tours with this organization all over Europe and now also in the USA, and they are always top-notch. If you want to dine at specific restaurants, do some research upfront and make reservations. My best tip is to look at Google Maps and choose the best-rated restaurants that are close to where you will be in the evening. There is no shortage of places to eat in NYC, but it's so busy everywhere. Wear comfortable shoes and dress in layers. You will be exploring from morning to evening, be sure that you are comfortable no matter what. Carry only things you really need. Most NYC attractions have airport-style security checks, plus, big bags aren't allowed in many places. The lighter you travel, the easier it will be! I also recommend swapping backpacks for crossbody bags. I packed a crossbody bag and only had to leave it in a locker once, when visiting the Crown of the Statue of Liberty (due to a very narrow staircase). Virgin Hotels New York City. This sums up our recommended 7-day New York itinerary. I hope that it helps you plan a truly memorable trip without spending a week on it, as I did ;).

We had both been to London before, though not for a few years, and we decided two weeks would be a comfortable amount of time to explore the city, and maybe take a day trip or two to explore other parts of the United Kingdom. Turns out, we never left the city and STILL ended up having things within the city that we didn't get to(so Matt returned this past fall to spend another 10 days exploring). It's one of our favorite cities in the world, and we will absolutely be back again every few years. London is huge, and there's a ton to do and see, so the hardest part about planning a trip to London is choosing between attractions. That's where we come in. In this guide, which is based on our recent experiences exploring London, we're going to give you our take on what you should prioritize in London. Along with what you shouldn't. Our favorite parts about London were the diverse range of food stalls at the innumerable food markets around the city, the city's great green spaces, and the amount of history that exists in London (most of which we didn't really know about, because to us, London history starts in the 16th Century according to what we learned in school). In this guide to planning your trip to London, you'll find a detailed 4 day London itinerary, complete with things to do, see, eat, and drink, along with the important details you need to know like how to see Westminster Cathedral and the best way to tackle the beast that is the British Museum. You'll also find logistics - like how to get around and some useful tips and tricks for visiting London - that are important for planning your trip. We hope you enjoy this guide, that you find it helpful for planning your trip, and we help you discover something new and exciting, whether it's your first time, or tenth. Sound good to you? Let's get into it.

We should start this section with a little context from our own trips. On our two most recent trips to London (both in the past few years), we have spent 14 days and 10 days in the city with big plans to get out of the city a few times and explore the less urban parts of the UK. On both trips, we have run into the same problem: there is just so much to do, see, eat, and drink in London that we have only managed to make it to one of the many day trips we've had on our list. London is a massive city and is jam-packed with history, culture, and, most importantly (obviously), great food (including gluten free food - here's my guide to eating gluten free in London). We'd put London in the same tier as Rome and Paris when it comes to the size of the city and number of attractions. As a result we'd strongly recommend no less than four days in London if you can manage it. Anything less will have you jetting around from sight to sight with no time to relax and experience what truly makes London special. With four days, you'll comfortably be able to fit in a museum or two, a couple of churches, a bunch of fun food markets (and other places to eat and drink), and catch a show in the West End. This itinerary is meant to help you see the best of the city without needing a vacation from your vacation. If you have more time, we have recommendations below in the \"more time\" section on how to spend it. However, you could also just pick a neighborhood and spend a day wandering from shop to shop, coffee to coffee, pub to pub. Where to Stay in London The first thing you need to know here is that there are a nearly unlimited number of places you could stay in London. However, it's a big city and, after our last trip, we realized that there are really just a few central neighborhoods that have the combination of hotel selection and public transit connections that put them in a tier above the rest. We have an entire guide dedicated to choosing a place to stay in London, which you should read for far more detail than we have in this summary. Here's a quick summary of that guide if you're short on time (though we'd recommend reading the section of the place you end up staying for tips and places to add to your list!). If you're looking to stay in our favorite neighborhood in London, stay in Bankside (which is part of the borough of Southwark). While the Tube connections are slightly worse than the other two central neighborhoods we like (more on them in a second), we much prefer the vibes on the south side of the river (especially on the weekends, when the City of London - which is essentially the Financial District - is a dead zone, and many of the businesses are closed). We've stayed at CitizenM Bankside, and we loved it. It was actually our first CitizenM stay, and we've since stayed at three of their other locations around the world (if that tells you anything about how our experience went). I also stayed at Native Bankside on my latest trip, a modern aparthotel with kitchen facilities in each room, which we also liked for a longer stay (I like to have more space because I do a lot of my best writing on location). If it's your first time in London, you can't go wrong with Covent Garden. Covent Garden is akin to the Centro Storico in Rome or Florence (or any Italian city, really) or Le Marais in Paris. Not because it's the oldest part of the city (that's the City of London), but because it's the beating heart of the city in a lot of ways. It's central, well connected, and will put you in a perfect position to explore the adjacent neighborhoods on foot and zip around the city on public transit. Stay at Page8 (which is literally across from the National Gallery) if you're looking for a hip boutique hotel, or at the Z Hotel Covent Garden if you're looking for something more affordable. For more space, look at Cove Arne Street, an aparthotel we almost stayed at (but chose the City of London location below instead). If it's a short trip and you're looking for the most convenient location, we'd go with the City of London. We've stayed here multiple times now, and while it's not necessarily the most charming part of the city, it is certainly among the most convenient. Which isn't surprising considering that it's essentially London's Financial District, and thus has great connections to most parts of the city (including, crucially, London Heathrow). If you're looking for a hotel with a good value, take a look at the City of London Club. If you want a little more space, we've stayed at both Cove Cannon Street and Native King's Wardrobe, two nice aparthotels a few blocks from St. Paul's Cathedral which would be a great choice. If you want to stay in the hippest part of the city with great food, drinks, and nightlife, stay in Shoreditch / Spitalfields. The markets here are must-visits - Spitalfields Market, Brick Lane, and the Sunday Upmarket - and the area has a great blend of location and vibes (it's all skaters and street art). One Hundred Shoreditch is the place to stay to be in the middle of all the action in Shoreditch, and if you're looking for a unique experience, there are two pubs with rooms above them that would be a fun way to spend a few nights in London ( the Culpeper and the Buxton). Important Tips for Visiting London Here are some tips and tricks for planning your visit to London that are probably most helpful for first timers. As Americans, traveling to London is noticeably different than traveling to other places in Europe, like Italy or Portugal, due to the absence of a language barrier. It feels much more similar to home, even though it's really not. There are certainly cultural and practical differences that you'll want to know going in. Here are a few things that we've learned about London to keep in mind as you're planning your trip. Early Mornings are Best for the Main Sights For sights like St. Paul's Cathedral, the Tower of London, and Westminster Abbey, try to get there when they open. Especially on a Sunday. Alysha went on a solo trip to the Tower of London (Matt has been multiple times before) and was surprised at how empty it was on a Sunday morning! We had the same experience on a Thursday morning at St. Paul's Cathedral. In the summer, it will still be busy in the morning, but not as busy as midday or later in the afternoon. London is Massive We LOVE walking around cities, and think it's the best way to experience a city. But if we're being honest, it's nearly impossible to walk around London - it's just too big! We didn't quite understand just how massive London is until we had spent some time moving around it. I mean, sure, we knew it was a huge city with 10 million people, but I don't think we quite understood just how long it takes to get from one end of the city to the other. The good news is that the public transportation network in London is excellent. You can use the buses and the Tube (the Underground) to zip around the city. Public Transportation is Both Expensive and 100% Worth it Getting around London using the Tube is fast, efficient, and is absolutely something you should take advantage of. A lot of people balk at the £6 per ride cost of riding the Tube in London, but if you dig a little deeper, you'll find that it's definitely worth it. The alternative to public transportation is taking a taxi or rideshare, which is more expensive. And, though you're only in London for four days, a weeklong unlimited transit pass is just £38.70, which means it's £10 a day for unlimited access (plus £5 for an Oyster card). For that reason (p.s., the answer can be well over an hour, depending on where you're headed), we highly recommend investing in an unlimited public transportation card while you're in London, which is called a Travelcard and is something you can buy at the machines at most Tube stations. The Travelcard gives you unlimited access to the Underground and buses in London. Both are efficient, relatively clean (coming from the US), and will get you from point A to point B far faster than your own two feet. You'll need to choose the duration based on your trip - one day, two days, a week. More information here. Since you'll likely only need zones 1-2 for most of the sights in Central London, we'd recommend purchasing your Travelcard separately from your trip from the airport, if you choose to take the Tube from Heathrow. The airport is outside of that range, and it would increase the price of your pass substantially. Top Travel Tip: Use the \"TFL\" (Transport for London) app on the Apple or Google Play store for an app with a wealth of maps, timetables and transport information. The Museums are Mostly Free (!) Unlike most other cities, where you'll have to shell out a lot of money to visit the museums, the main museums in London are free. In high season, it's best to make a reservation for a timed entry in advance to make sure you can get in. We love this aspect of London, because it makes it so that you can poke your head in, see if you're really interested in something, and then decide to opt out if it's not for you without the \"we just spent £30 on this, I guess we have to stick it out\" guilt. They Drive on the Other Side of the Road We, of course, knew this going in, but that didn't stop us from nearly getting run over on our first few days in London on both of our most recent visits. Luckily, in the center of London, there are helpful \"look left / right\" signs on the ground at crosswalks, which saved our lives multiple times. When in doubt, look both ways. Three times. Specific Days of the Week to Keep in Mind for Your Trip One of the things we realized as we sat down to outline this guide is that a lot of the things to do depend on what days of the week you're in town. This is particularly relevant for some of the food markets. For example, Borough Market is packed on Saturday, closed on Sunday, and great on weekdays. But only at lunchtime! On the other hand, Broadway Market up north is really a Saturday (or Sunday, but Saturday is better) destination, when the streets are packed with vendors selling all kinds of delicious food. Here are some considerations for days of the week to keep in mind as you're planning your trip (there's more detail on what exactly these places are and what they offer in the detailed itinerary below). Borough Market: Lunch only, Monday to Saturday. Broadway Market: Definitely go on Saturday for lunch. Camden Market: Mostly a lunch spot, and you should also go on Saturday if you can. Spitalfields Market: Weekends are best here, when the entire interior is lined with stalls selling food, arts and crafts, and other fun stuff to peruse. Portobello Road Market: The market in Notting Hill is, again, best on Saturdays, when the majority of vendors are set up. Columbia Road Flower Market: Sundays only! The Sunday Upmarket: The vintage/food market on Brick Lane is a weekends only destination, both Saturday and Sunday. \"WOW\" you say, \"that's a LOT of weekend only markets - which ones do you like best?\" If we had to choose, we'd opt for the Broadway Market, which feels much more like a neighborhood farmers market than any other market we visited (and we went twice!), and the Spitalfields Market and Upmarket, which are a few blocks away from each other. You should also definitely visit Camden Market and Borough Market, but the day of the week matters less for those (though they're both lunchtime destinations, rather than evening destinations). 4 Days in London: A Perfect Itinerary for First Timers Now that we've covered some of the logistics and other things that are good to know before your trip, let's get into exactly how we'd spend 4 days exploring the city. There's a lot to do and see in London. You're not going to be able to see it all with just four days (even with two trips spanning more than three weeks, we had to scrap a couple of day trips because we felt like the city deserved more of our time). Our goal with this itinerary is to help you decide what to do in London, and to give you a mix of the traditional tourist sights - the museums, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, etc. - and some of the less visited places that don't make it on every tourist's radar, but we found to be worth the time and effort. We have a secret for you. And it's a lesson that it took us years of traveling to finally learn on our three month European extravaganza a few years ago. Travel is better - and by better, we mean more rewarding, interesting, and fun - when you try your best to connect with locals to see the place through their eyes. I (Matt here!) took that to heart on my last visit to London in an effort to better understand what makes the city special, and came away with a much richer understanding of London's unique culture and point of view on life. Particularly on that latest trip, I did a bunch of different tours and experiences (I've included the ones that I thought were particularly special in the guide below) that opened my eyes to a new side of the city, culture, and people. Our biggest tip for London (or any city, really) is to prioritize tours that connect you with locals and allow you to get a unique perspective on the city (which is what you're going to see in this itinerary). In terms of structure, we always do our best to anchor the days in our itineraries around a main experience, with time on either side for things like coffee, cocktails, and good old fashioned wandering around a neighborhood. And we never, ever do multiple museums in a single day. Trust us and learn from our mistakes - you WILL be exhausted by the time you get to the second one, and will get a lot less out of it. To make the most out of your trip to London, plan to do one or two major sights a day, and dedicate the rest to walking around the neighborhoods while leaving yourself energy to go out for a drink and a show in the evenings. Here's an overview of the 4 day itinerary you'll find below: Day 1: The City of London and Shoreditch Day 2: Westminster, the West End, and a Museum Day 3: Southbank and the Tower of London Day 4: A Foray into North London (Camden and Notting Hill) Below the detailed itinerary, you'll find some suggestions on what to do with more or less time on your trip to London, including options for compressing this itinerary into one, two, or three days. One other thing to know: we're not going to (many) give specific recommendations on places to eat for two reasons. One, Matt has Celiac Disease and traditional British food is tough if you need to eat gluten free (luckily, there are a bunch of other cuisines all over London), so we're not really the right people to give that advice (except for the best gluten free restaurants in London, which we have plenty of opinions about). Two, it depends so much on your tastes and budget. So we'll let you figure that out on your own, for the most part. Day 1: The City of London and Shoreditch On the first day of your trip to London, start in the oldest part of the city (which, as we'll cover below, actually feels like the newest part) to gain an understanding of where the city started, and how it got to where it is today. Along the way, you'll learn about the origins of London. Most historians think London's history starts with the Roman settlement, but there were certainly people here before that. You'll visit St. Paul's Cathedral, the London Museum, and take a walk through the \"old town\" before spending your afternoon and evening in the part of London that is definitely not the old town - Shoreditch (which is the hip spot to be with great bars and restaurants of all kinds). Important itinerary note: Spitalfields Market and the Upmarket are best on the weekends, which means you should do your best to have this day fall on a weekend. In particular, this would make an excellent Sunday itinerary (minus St. Paul's, which is closed Sunday). St. Paul's Cathedral St. Paul's Cathedral is one of the more interesting aspects of London's history, and the archaeologist who led our excellent walking tour (we'd highly recommend it if you're interested in the history of London - here it is) remarked that it's probably the single most important building in all of London when it comes to the city's history. Why, you ask? A couple of reasons. There are two times in London's history that the city has essentially been leveled. The first was in the late 17th Century, when a fire started at a bakery on \"Pudding Lane\" (yes, that's actually the name of the street where all the bakeries were) and ended up burning down something like two thirds of the City of London. Then, during the Blitz in World War 2 when a huge portion of Central London was reduced to rubble, the dome of St. Paul's stood strong, serving as an important symbol of the resilience of the city in the face of adversity. In both cases, St. Paul's Cathedral played an important role in the city's healing and coping with the disasters. It was built after the fire as a sort of \"feather in the cap\" of the government at the time. We learned on the walking tour that it was very much a political symbol more than a religious one, one that said \"we're rebuilding London, and we're doing it right.\" The truth is that German bombers could recognize the dome from above, and did their best to avoid it (though I'm not quite sure how possible that really was given the technology at the time). We'd recommend heading up to the dome of St. Paul's, and being the first ones up there if you can swing it. The dome access starts at 9:30 am, and it's a long climb up a variety of different staircases to reach the top. There are three levels on the way up - the Whispering Gallery (the interior of the dome), the Stone Gallery (the exterior of the base of the dome), and the Golden Gallery (at the tippy top of the dome). It's worth stopping at all three, and definitely go all the way to the top, where the views are outstanding! Make sure to visit the crypt, where two important figures in British history are buried. You'll find the Duke of Wellington (famous for leading British forces in the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo) and Lord Admiral Nelson (also famous for outwitting Napoleon, among other things), among others. Entry is a little pricey, but we think it's worth the money. To save money, you can book tickets online in advance for a slight discount, which saves you a few pounds a person. More information on hours, costs, and more here. Monday to Saturday only, closed on Sundays for service. One New Change's Rooftop Terrace After you've done the cathedral itself, head up the sixth floor free rooftop terrace of One New Change, a fancy shopping center across the street, for one of the best views of the dome in all of London. It's completely free, and it's open from 6:00 am to midnight every day. You take the elevator from the middle of the building up to the terrace, and from there you have an unobstructed view of the dome of St. Paul's. You can find information on the terrace, including opening hours, here. The London Museum Head directly north from the cathedral up to the excellent (and free) London Museum. It's worth taking an hour (or two, if you're really into it) to peruse the museum, which covers the history of the city from prehistoric times to modern times in chronological order, weaving a story about the history of London and how it came to be the city it is today. We enjoyed this museum, and we learned a lot about British history and the history of the city that we definitely had never thought about before. I'll give you two examples. First is the fact that, for large swaths of its history, London was under the control of outsiders. As Americans, we never really think of the British as being colonized and oppressed, but that is certainly how they spent the bulk of history before the medieval periods. First it's the Romans, then they leave and the Saxons move in, then it's the Normans. Second is the fact that London, the cosmopolitan city that we know and love today, was shaped by two disasters (which we already touched on above) - the fire in the 17th Century that burned the majority of the city (which at the time, was mostly wood) to the ground, and the Blitz during World War 2. Without those two events, the modernization of London would have been much more difficult, and Central London would likely look very, very different from how it does today. We enjoyed the museum, and think it's a nice short way to get an understanding of the history of the city before diving into what it is today. Important note: The museum is closed for renovations in 2025, and is set to reopen in 2026. Unfortunate because it was one of our favorite discoveries on our recent trip to London. An Afternoon and Evening in Shoreditch We're not sure we've ever seen a higher concentration of vintage stores than we saw in Shoreditch. And that tells you a lot about this hip neighborhood in northeast London and the transformation it has undergone in the past decade or so. At one point, Shoreditch was completely separate from the city of London, but over the years the borders of London have continually expanded, swallowing up former suburbs on its way to becoming the city it is today. Even the origin story of Shoreditch is a little counterculture. It became famous because in the 16th Century, some politicians got the idea that banning playhouses (and theaters) in London sounded like a good idea. You know, to remain chaste and godly and all that. Imagine what they'd think if they saw London today! So, in order to meet the demand that certainly hadn't evaporated despite the ban, new theaters were built in places like Shoreditch and Southwark, which at the time were outside of the city limits, and thus its jurisdiction. In the 19th and early 20th Centuries, it was a legitimate rival to the West End as the center of London's arts scene. After the second world war, during which large swaths of the neighborhood were demolished - including a lot of housing - the reconstruction process took a little longer than other parts of London. Since then, the story of Shoreditch is similar to many other highly gentrified areas in major cities around the world. First the artists moved in, creating a demand for businesses that those artists liked, and finally ending with astronomical housing prices that drove out many of the original residents (and those artists, too) and brought in a more wealthy contingent, who in turn brought a different set of businesses to cater to their different needs. On your way from the City of London to Shoreditch, there are a bunch of stops worth making, but we're going to give you a few to start. Start with a rooftop drink at the roof garden at the Culpeper, make your way to Old Spitalfields Market to wander the stalls with art, food, and drinks (weekends only), and then head over to Brick Lane, stopping by the Upmarket if this happens to fall on a weekend, and follow Brick Lane north into Shoreditch. Day 2: Westminster, the West End, and a Museum On your second day in London, start your day in the city of Westminster, make your way to Covent Garden, and head through Hyde Park to check out a museum (there are two choices here, which we've outlined below). Westminster is a relatively small patch of London, but contains a higher concentration of London's famous spots than anywhere else in the city, so we'd try to beat the crowds and head out early. But First, Coffee! If you're looking for some of the best coffee in London, you're in luck - two of our favorites are within a few blocks of each other near Westminster Abbey, which is where you'll be starting your day today. The first, and our overall top recommendation in London for coffee nerds (like me, Matt), is Nostos Coffee. They have your usual drinks - lattes and Americanos and the like - but they also have an incredible special menu featuring pour over coffee and single origin espresso from some of my favorite roasters in Europe. We came here multiple times on our latest trip because both the coffee and the service were among the best we found in London. The second, and another of my favorites, is Formative Coffee. Formative is more focused on espresso, and they have five or six different coffees available as espresso on any given day, with a couple of filter coffee options (batch brew) alongside them. We not only had some really fun coffees - a white honey gesha that the owner used in the World Barista Championships and a weird green apple co-fermented coffee that was like drinking one of those caramel apple lollipops we had as kids - but the baristas went out of their way to give us advice about London (and specifically where else to go in London for great coffee). The freeze distilled flat white at Nostos Between those two, you'll be in great hands in terms of your morning caffeination (and ready to start your day in earnest). Westminster Bridge and Big Ben The first stop of the day should be the eastern end of Westminster Bridge, across the river from Big Ben ( here on Google Maps). You might be tempted to go straight to Westminster station, but we think the walk over the bridge is well worth it because of the excellent view of Big Ben you get as you cross the bridge. The world famous tower, officially known as the \"Elizabeth Tower\", houses the giant bell affectionately known as \"Big Ben\", whose unmistakable chime has sounded across the city for over 150 years. Big Ben refers to the bell, not the tower itself. To hear the bell going off, you'll want to be on the bridge about 10 minutes before the turn of the hour (so, 8:50 am to hear the 9:00 am bells). Either side of the bridge works fine, but the better view is going to be from the southern end of the bridge. As of the time of writing, Big Ben has been under construction for several years, and there's likely to be some scaffolding up around it. It's still a great view, though. At the other side of the bridge, you'll find yourself adjacent to the Houses of Parliament. You can actually visit the Houses of Parliament and take a guided tour that allows you to access parts of the complex you wouldn't ordinarily be able to. If that sounds interesting to you, you can find more information here (it's a 90 minute tour, and it's fairly pricey). Westminster Abbey Walk across the square in front of parliament - make sure to walk by the statues of famous Brits like Winston Churchill - on your way over to Westminster Abbey, which is your first stop of the morning. This is a gigantic Gothic Cathedral that was built in the 13th Century by Henry III as both a monument to Edward the Confessor, and as a final resting place for his own body. The history from there is kind of fascinating, mostly because of the intermingling of the monarchy and church over the course of centuries. On a walking tour, the history professor leading the tour (we did this walking tour and really enjoyed it) said that, essentially, the church was very, very rich, and the monarchy said something to the effect of \"yeah, we want in on that.\" Which I'm sure is painting with broad strokes and missing a lot of historical nuance. But on the other hand, yeah, that checks out. Essentially, in the mid 15th Century, Henry VIII (yes, that one, the one that enjoyed beheading his wives) got mad at the Catholic Church for not signing off on his divorce. So, naturally, he seized all assets owned by the church and took control of them for himself. Often, selling off pieces of them to fund his various adventures around Europe. From there, the royal family and the church became intertwined. Divine right and all that jazz. Today, it's the site of royal weddings, coronation ceremonies, and burials, but it's mostly a tourist attraction. More than 3,000 Brits are buried in Westminster Abbey - the most famous being many of the royals of the last few centuries, and people like Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. Make sure to look down as you walk around the interior - it seems like every step you take inside of the Abbey, you're walking onto a new burial site with the name and dates of their life/death. The Abbey opens at 9:30 am (9:00 am on Saturdays, closed on Sundays), which is pretty early, and we'd recommend trying to be one of the first people in the door. To do that, we'd buy online tickets in advance, which go on sale two months in advance. Buckingham Palace (and the Changing of the Guard) From Westminster Abbey, it's a nice walk through St. James's Park to get to Buckingham Palace, which is where the King supposedly lives (but spends almost zero time there these days, according to multiple people we talked to). Side note: What the heck is going on with that \"s's\" at the end of \"St. James's Park\"? Yes, that's the correct spelling. We had to quadruple check. This is also where the most \"touristy\" activity on this entire itinerary happens - the Changing of the Guard. That being said, it's quite the spectacle (we can't believe this still happens, to be completely honest) and it's worth seeing once, as long as you're prepared for the crowds and have the flexibility to show up a little early at a specific time on a specific day. You'll need to pay close attention to the official schedule for this one, as the ceremony schedule varies by the season. You'll also need to plan your day to arrive here by at least 10:45 am, and probably a lot earlier if you want to get a good view, especially during the summer. Trafalgar Square and the West End At some point during their London visit, virtually everyone ends up at Trafalgar Square. Probably because it's right in the middle of all the action. To get there from the palace, just walk straight out \"the Mall\" and you'll land at the southern end of the square after you walk under the Admiralty Arch. The square is home to Nelson's Column, dedicated to the beloved naval hero of the same name who outwitted Napoleon multiple times, Trafalgar Square has been a huge draw for tourists, locals, and flocks of pigeons since Victorian times. There's also an excellent view back towards Big Ben from the south end of the square. And lots of lions. What is it about lions that makes every single king or queen go \"what animal do I want to be? Yeah, a lion, that's the one!\" Why not switch it up and get creative every once in a while and be a warthog or a water buffalo or something? Seven Dials Market for Lunch and Exploring Covent Garden Another food market! Hooray! Seriously though, our favorite part of London was all the incredible food markets, which is pretty evident in our construction of this itinerary. There's basically a different food market every single day! Today, it's the Seven Dials Market, a food hall housed in a former warehouse in Covent Garden. We were confused by the banana logo that we saw all over the building, and it turns out this warehouse was primarily used to store bananas back in the day, hence the logo. And cucumbers, too! There are a ton of good food options here, and we have one specific recommendation, Chai Guys, which is some of the best chai that Alysha had in London (she LOVES chai, and these guys / gals do it right!). Get the kadak, which is a sweeter, creamier version. The area around the market is also worth exploring. Historic and elegant Covent Garden, situated in London's West End, is probably our favorite part of central London. But Covent Garden was absolutely not always the manicured, tourist-friendly district that you find today. In fact, we learned on our tour of the National Portrait Gallery (more on that in a second) that it was basically the Red Light District for most of its history, and it's only a recent development that it has become relatively posh. It's worth a stop at the Apple Market to see it at its poshest, where you'll find a bunch of luxury stores inside a historic produce market. If you're interested in a crash course in Covent Garden history, we'd recommend this walking tour with the company who we did our National Portrait Gallery tour with. I wanted to do this on my latest trip, but the timing didn't work out to make it happen. There's enough to do in Covent Garden to last an entire day, but you've got a lot to see, so we'd say that you should get some food, do some wandering around the Seven Dials and Neal's Yard areas, and move on. There's some good shopping, some great coffee ( Monmouth, in particular), and we enjoyed Neal's Yard Dairy, where we picked out a couple of English cheeses to enjoy later with some excellent fig jam. Choose Your Own Museum Adventure We love the fact that most of London's museums are completely free, which is something we'd love to see happen at home more often because it makes it so much more accessible - you don't have to wander around for seven hours trying to make the most of the $40 you spent on admission, you can just see what you want to see and leave. However, you should know going in that it does mean that these museums are going to be CROWDED at peak hours (think the middle of the day). You can and should make a reservation to visit if you can. A couple of notes here before we get to the two museums we would recommend focusing on. We're going to focus on museums that say something meaningful about the history of London and the U.K. more broadly, which means the National Gallery and Natural History Museum are out. Both could very well be in any major city around the world. We also would absolutely NOT recommend the Churchill War Rooms, which are not free (and are relatively expensive) and absolutely made their way onto my \"the most overrated tourist attractions in the world\" list. It's just one big propaganda campaign about how great of a guy Winston Churchill was (spoiler: he, uh, wasn't) without any nuance or acknowledgment of his flaws. He was definitely a war hero, but that didn't come without any downsides. If you're really interested in the World War 2 stuff, we'd highly recommend heading to the Imperial War Museums across the river, which is both free and offers a much more balanced look at the war (plus an exhibit on the First World War, too). Which means there are two museums - both near Covent Garden - that we think would make a good stop for your afternoon; the National Portrait Gallery, and the British Museum. Option 1: The British Museum We actually went to the British Museum on our previous trip to London, and left within 30 minutes or so. For two reasons. First, it's not a particularly well thought out museum - how could it be with so many different time periods and culture covered - and it's kind of all over the place. We didn't know where to start, so we started with the Egyptian artifacts, which leads me to the second reason. Second, this is all stolen stuff. Imagine this for a second: you walk into a museum in Egypt and find the remains of the British Royal Family on display for the world to see. Do we think that would go over well? We don't, and the cultural voyeurism felt a little strange to us. However, like I alluded to above, the British Museum DOES tell an important story about the history of the U.K., London, and the British Empire, so I was determined to After a bunch of research into different tours, I stumbled across this guided tour with Daniel that I immediately fell in love with (and booked) because it tackles the issues with the British Museum head on. It was a great way to go through the museum, and felt more like a conversation than a lecture. We talked about the artifacts we were looking at, their significance to the culture they actually belong to, and how they ended up in the Museum's collection. We also learned about all of the controversy around giving things back (spoiler: they can't and won't for various reasons). All that being said, there really are some cultural treasures from India, China, and Egypt in this museum, along with a tiny collection of things from the British Isles (which is kind of funny - usually you'd expect that section to be bigger). It just comes with a bunch of complicated questions and concerns that are hard to process without an expert helping you work through them. And we think thinking about those complications is an important part of visiting this museum. The museum itself is free, though lines can get extremely long (which is the security line) at peak hours. Leave the bags at home and head to the back entrance ( here on Google Maps) to skip that line BUT you can only do that if you do not have bags. Option 2: The National Portrait Gallery Not to be confused with the National Gallery, which is kind of just a run-of-the-mill art museum, the National Portrait Gallery is a collection of, you guessed it, portraits of various mediums and time periods that tell a story about the country's history. Portraits ranging from regal interpretations of George the III (of Hamilton fame) to various abolitionists and suffragettes (and everything in between) adorn the walls, and there's not really a clear narrative, which makes it a little hard to wrap your head around. On this last trip, we opted to do a guided tour here (with aforementioned Rebel Tours) and really enjoyed it. We spent a couple of hours getting a crash course in British history, with a mix of the mainstream history featuring kings and queens, and some lesser known but equally important figures like the suffragettes and abolitionists who shaped the United Kingdom as we know it today. They also have free tours of the gallery at 12:00pm and 3:00 pm (at the time of writing) that cover the highlights in 45 minutes. Our last recommendation if you don't do the tour we recommended above is to bring your own headphones so that you can take advantage of the digital guide, which you'll use on your own phone. Visiting the museum is free, but it is recommended that you make a free online booking in advance of showing up. The gallery is also open late on Fridays and Saturdays, which would be a nice relatively quiet time to enjoy the museum. Wandering Hyde Park After a history lesson, it's time to get outside and get some fresh air. Make your way towards the southeastern corner of Hyde Park. To get there, you can either walk down Oxford Street through Soho, which is similar to Times Square in New York or the Champs-Élysées in Paris, or you can hop on the Tube (Piccadilly Line) and get off at Hyde Park Corner station, which is at the southeastern corner of the park. We'd recommend starting at that corner of the park because you get to see the Wellington Arch, which commemorates the Duke of Wellington's defeat of Napoleon. Side note: Everybody has a victory arch - the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the many victory arches in Rome around the Forum, everybody gets an arch! Then, as you enter the park, you're immediately confronted with the rose garden, which is cool (although it won't be blooming in the winter and fall). Spend some time wandering through the park, checking out the Serpentine (that's the lake) and the Serpentine Waterfall ( here on Google Maps), a particularly pretty section of greenery. Day 3: Southbank and the Tower of London On your third day, start off bright and early at the Tower of London, then make your way across the Tower Bridge to start a walk along the south bank of the Thames down to Westminster Bridge, with plenty of stops along the way (including a stop at Borough Market for lunch). Important itinerary note: Since Borough Market is closed Sundays, we'd make sure this day lands on any day but Sunday. Ideally a weekday, because Borough Market is wild on Saturdays (many friends in London told me not to go on a weekend). The Tower of London On my latest trip to London, I spent my first morning solo awaiting the arrival of my brother, and I decided to tackle the Tower of London that morning so that I had something to do while I was jet lagged and tired. At that point, I had already done the Tower of London twice before - never on a tour - and I realized as I was walking through the room displaying the Crown Jewels that I actually had no recollection of ever seeing them before, despite having done it twice. That's probably because we spent only about an hour on each visit, which isn't really enough time to understand what you're looking at. On this last trip, I decided to do this guided tour at opening - which includes the Ceremony of the Keys where the Yeoman Warders unlock the Tower for the day - to spend a little more time understanding what exactly I was looking at, and I enjoyed it and it definitely gave me a deeper understanding of the significance. It also meant that we were literally third in line to enter the building where the Crown Jewels are held, which was cool. Apparently in peak times there are LONG lines to get into that building, but we basically had it to ourselves. Whether you do the tour or not, we'd highly, HIGHLY recommend visiting the Tower of London first thing in the morning. And we'd go a step further and say your first stop should be the Crown Jewels. It's a popular tourist attraction, and we were totally expecting it to be crowded early on a weekend morning when we showed up. But, somehow, when the doors opened, it was miraculously empty, save for a few other groups. Get there at opening time if you can. You'll have the place largely to yourself, and it will get more and more crowded over the morning. Anyway, what is the Tower? The Tower of London sits at the southeastern corner of the town of Londinium, which was established by the Romans. The tower as we know it today was built in the 11th Century by William the Conqueror as a fortress, and has served a wide variety of purposes since its construction, including as a royal palace and, probably most famously, as a notorious prison. When you really get into it, the history of the Tower of London is pretty dark. There were so many people executed and tortured here that there are more than three different areas that are marked as places of execution in and around the tower. Tower Bridge from inside the Tower of London Mostly, it was political opponents who were executed for trumped up crimes to get them out of the picture. Multiple members of the royal family have also died within the walls of the Tower, including Henry VI and a pair of princes who disappeared (and were later confirmed to have been buried in the tower). Since its construction, it has been constantly added to and expanded. Today, the main attractions you're going to focus on are the Crown Jewels, the ramparts, and the White Tower - the big castle-looking structure in the middle of the complex. If you're looking for a different tour, we'd highly recommend joining one of the Yeoman Warder tours, which happen every 30 minutes and are included in the price of entry. More information, including prices and current hours, is available here. Tower Bridge To get to your next destination - the south bank of the Thames - you'll need to cross the river. You have two options here, and both have their advantages. We'd recommend crossing over Tower Bridge, which was built in the late 19th Century and is probably the most iconic of London's bridges. You probably think it's London Bridge, a confusion that many tourists (including my brother, Connor) make, but that's actually the next bridge down the river (and it's just a gray concrete slab). The Twin Towers, connected by a walkway (we'll get to that in a second), is one of the main elements of architecture that people think of when they think of London. Although, as the archaeologist who led our excellent walking tour of London pointed out, most people think it's the London Bridge. We would NOT recommend going up to the top of the bridge, which used to be a legitimate mode of transportation for pedestrians to cross when the drawbridge was up to let boats through, but has shamelessly been turned into a tourist attraction. The alternative is crossing London Bridge, which is west of the Tower of London. The advantage? A picture perfect view of Tower Bridge. The downside? The bridge is kind of boring in terms of architecture. Plus, one of the best views of the City of London's skyline is from the river level just west of Tower Bridge on the south bank. Here, you get a great view of the bridge, and also a nice view of the Tower of London and City of London across the river. Lunch at Borough Market Borough Market, dating back (almost unbelievably) to before the 12th Century, is one of the largest and oldest markets in the city. Despite being crowded and very touristy, Borough Market is one of our favorite places in the city, full stop. However, we would caution you about coming here on a weekend, which is when the number of people here peaks and it is a ZOO. Avoid making this day your Saturday (or Sunday, when the market is closed), if you can. There are a couple of sections of the market, not to mention the countless bars and restaurants lining the streets around the market. You should know that Borough Market is VERY MUCH a lunch destination - it closes in the late afternoon. And it's closed all day on Sunday, so make sure this falls on any other day of the week. Essentially, the market is split into two main sections: the ready-to-eat food section (which is where you should eat lunch), and the gourmet food items section. The latter features stands selling everything from English cheese, to tea, to all things Italian, and just about everything else a foodie could dream of. If you're looking for coffee, Monmouth Coffee is great, and has a location right outside the western edge of the market ( here on Google Maps). Take some time to wander through that section of the market and, when you're ready for food, head over to the section with all the food stalls for lunch. We found ourselves here not once, not twice, but three different times over the course of our time in London. Here are the places we fell in love with, in no particular order. Khanom Krok: One of my favorite meals in London on this last trip was the pad thai from this stand at Borough Market, with the mango sticky rice for dessert. I returned a second time to try their Massaman curry, too, which was almost equally delicious (I still prefer the pad thai). Make sure to squeeze plenty of lime! The Black Pig: Amazing pork sandwiches that Alysha demanded to return to on our last day in London. The line here can be nuts. Get the Honey Truffle Parmesan, which is made with slow roasted pork shoulder, honey-truffle mayo, slaw, and aged parmesan. YUM. DEFINITELY NOT GLUTEN FREE. Horn OK Please: Vegetarian Indian street food, including dosas and amazing chai. Matt ate here three times, and would do it again in a heartbeat. Gluten free and vegan options. Tacos Padre: We've had some pretty mediocre tacos around the world, but I would put Tacos Padre somewhere near the top of the list of the best tacos I've ever had outside of California and Mexico. The lamb barbacoa and the cochinita (a pork slow cooked with achiote) were outstanding. Alysha's massive sandwich at the Black Pig After lunch, there's one more stop that we highly recommend at Borough Market - the Cider House. They have a great selection of hard ciders, both on tap and in bottles, to try. Most are from English cider producers, but we also found offerings here from New Zealand, France, and South Africa. The friendly staff will help you figure out what kind of cider to try based on your tastes. A Walk Along the South Bank of the Thames When I touch down in London, I'm generally jetlagged and tired from a long flight from the west coast of the US. To combat that jetlag and stretch my legs, I head out to the southern bank of the Thames and walk from Tower Bridge to Westminster Bridge (home of Big Ben), past places like Borough Market (worth a stop for food!), the Tate Modern, and Millenium Bridge. This stretch - about three miles or so - is my absolute favorite part of London for an early morning (or evening) walk, it's packed with things to do, see, eat, and drink. From Borough Market, make your way all the way down the river to Westminster Bridge, which should take you the better part of a few hours, including stops for a museum, a drink, a bookshop, a snack, and whatever else piques your interest along the way. Here are the main stops along this stretch of river. Shakespeare's Globe Theatre: For over 500 years, England has been a powerhouse in the world of theater, thanks in no small part to William Shakespeare. A visit to The Globe, a stunning recreation built close to the original Elizabethan theater, gives you the chance to travel back in time and experience a performance. Even if you're not a fan of theater, The Globe is absolutely worth a visit. The circular outdoor venue hosts productions between April and September, with some of the UK's most talented actors performing modern (and traditional) interpretations of Shakespeare's works. If you do want to catch a show, check the schedule here and find a place to fit it in on your itinerary. The Tate Modern: Located at the former Bankside Power Station, the Tate Modern is well worth a visit as you wander along the waterfront. The Tate Modern is England's national gallery dedicated exclusively to modern art. The permanent collections are completely free of charge to view, and include an impressive selection of art from the likes of Picasso, Rothko and Monet. On the 10th floor of the Tate's Blavatnik Building is an open terrace with fantastic views across the city to St. Paul's and Canary Wharf. Millennium Bridge: Just outside the Tate, this bridge is in this guide for one reason - the excellent view across the river to St. Paul's Cathedral. It's one of the best views in London, and is worth a slight detour to catch it. It's here on Google Maps. Here are a few other stops along the river bank. Foyles Bookshop: This is one of the best bookstores in London, and they have a location on the ground floor of Southbank Centre, right before you get to Jubilee Bridge (if you're heading southwest). Southbank Centre Food Market: This was a happy accident. It's Friday-Sunday only, so skip it if this day happens to be a weekday. We walked by it on a walk down the river and discovered Pabellon, our favorite arepa place in London. Arepas are basically a sandwich made between two corn patties that comes from Venezuela. Seriously, go here. It was so good we went back three times. There are plenty of other food stalls here, and there's also a nice outdoor courtyard with food and shopping called \"Gabriel's Wharf\" a little ways back ( here on Google Maps) that is worth poking your head into. The London Eye: The London Eye is a little overrated, if we're being honest. We've done it before, but opted out on our latest trip. It's a little expensive, the lines are long, and the view from the Tate Modern viewing platform - which is free - is a little better. If you have kids, this is a fun experience. If not, we'd probably skip it and spend time elsewhere. Once you're at London Eye, you're essentially at Westminster Bridge. You've already seen that if you followed the first day! Dinner and Drinks at Mercato Metropolitano To close out your day, head south of the river to another of our favorite discoveries in London, Mercato Metropolitano. This place is fantastic, and is essentially a big food hall with indoor and outdoor seating (in an atmospheric garden) and a huge variety of different food stalls... all attached to a beer garden! From Sicilian arancini and granita (two of our favorite discoveries on our Sicily road trip) to Venezuelan arepas, there are options for basically everyone here, which makes it a good choice for groups. It's a very, very popular spot - it was packed full to the brim on a Thursday night when we were there - and there are a bunch of different options to grab a drink. We'd recommend getting there a little early to snag a table, and hanging out and soaking up the atmosphere until you're ready for dinner. Day 4: A Foray into North London (Camden and Notting Hill) On your last day, venture out of Central London and head north (it's really only 20 minutes or so, nothing too crazy) out to Notting Hill. From there, make your way along the Regent's Canal to Little Venice, and finally stroll into Camden, with a stop for the view at Primrose Hill on the way. Notting Hill and Portobello Road Start your morning in Notting Hill at Notting Hill Gate station, which is serviced by the Central District, and Circle Tube lines. From there, embark on a self-guided walking tour of one of London's most charming neighborhoods, made famous by the movie of the same name. You'll essentially follow Portobello Road all the way through the neighborhood from south to north, which will take you to both highlights here - the Portobello Road Market, and the colorful houses at the other end of the neighborhood. Here's a map of the walk. The Portobello Road Market is best on Saturdays, when the streets are packed with vendors. But it's worth a stroll on other days of the week too, particularly Fridays. It's part food market, part antique market, and part everything else market. At the northern end, leave Portobello Road and head to the two most photogenic parts of the neighborhood, where you'll find those colorful homes that have made this area Instagram famous in recent years. Both areas are literally a block away from each other - Saint Lukes Mews is a colorful back alley, and Lancaster Road is where you'll find the multi-colored houses (which remind us of the famous Victorians in San Francisco, where we met, lived for a decade, and got married!). A Walk Along Regent's Canal This next section is optional, and is best for people who are up for a nice walk. It's sometimes scenic, sometimes a little boring. If that doesn't sound like something you're interested in, take the Tube to Camden and skip this section. We actually walked all the way from Notting Hill to Camden along Regent's Canal, which took a couple of hours and led us through Little Venice, which is easily the most picturesque piece of the walk. Here's a map of the route. Near the end, you'll be walking across the canal from the London Zoo in Regents Park, and you can see the giraffes, warthogs, and African wild dogs from the path. Camden Market (and Camden Town) Camden is a fascinating area, and we spent a third of one of our recent trips staying here to soak it all up. Punk music was essentially born in this part of London, and that part of the neighborhood's character is still very much front and center, with a variety of eclectic shops blasting heavy metal music lining Camden High Street. However, the highlight here is London's most-visited food market, Camden Market. Situated right on Regent's Canal, Camden Market is a sprawling complex of shops, food stalls, and more permanent restaurants. There are several sections of the market, but the best part is on the north side of the Canal ( here on Google Maps). The market is overwhelming, with all sorts of smells and sounds attacking your senses, but it's well worth wandering a bit to take in everything it has to offer, from Indonesian curries to heavy metal-inspired t-shirts. It feels like it just keeps going and going, and the scale of the market is pretty staggering. Here are a few of our highlights that, unsurprisingly, heavily focus on food. El Pollote: Excellent (and gluten free!) guava-glazed chicken wings and sandwiches (the latter is not gluten free). Makatcha: Honestly, both the beef rendang and chicken coconut curry that I had at this Indonesian stand (on different days - they also have a stand at Broadway Market) probably make the top 10 bites of food I had in London. Arepazo / Arepa Venezuelan Kitchen: To be honest, I don't know what the name of this stand is. But I do know that it's the place to get arepas at Camden Market. The pabellón, a pulled beef, was some of the best we had in London, and the vibes at the stand with the blasting music and dancing chef were awesome. Kolkati: Not gluten free, but Alysha saw them at Broadway Market (another market worth visiting) and decided she had to have it. So she finally got it here at Camden Market. They make kati rolls, which are a street food staple of Kolkata that consists of fillings (either meat and accouterments or paneer) wrapped in bread. Primrose Hill A short walk away from Camden Market along Regent's Park Road (to the west), you'll find two of the once commonplace bright red British phone boxes, and after a classic photo opportunity, you'll see that you've reached the entrance to Primrose Hill park. Primrose Hill is a wonderful place to spend a sunny couple of hours. You won't find many tourists in this part of London, just lots of locals lounging in the sun or taking in the amazing vistas from this perfect vantage point, where you're able to see nearly every famous building in the city. After Primrose Hill, you'll be well into the afternoon of your last day in London. For the evening, we'd recommend grabbing dinner and drinks in a place that you've already visited, but wanted to spend more time. Catch a Show! We'd also recommend using this evening to catch a show, either at the Globe Theatre if you want a unique experience, or somewhere in the West End if you're looking to see one of the more famous contemporary shows. On my last trip to London, aside from doing a day trip, another big thing I wanted to make sure to do was catch a show. We actually ended up catching two shows - Hamilton (which was significantly cheaper than the touring version at home) and Operation Mincemeat, a comedy musical about an operation in World War 2 featuring a five person case playing a BUNCh of different roles (it's very fun). At home, we've seen Hamilton, Wicked, Moulin Rough (my favorite of the bunch), Book of Mormon, and Lion King, and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, and we'd recommend all of them (although Book of Mormon probably isn't for kids or people who are easily offended - sorry mom). Check out what shows are happening in London while you're in town here. What to Do with More Time in London Here are a few things to add to your itinerary if you happen to have more than four days. Take a Day Trip! One of the best parts about the UK being a relatively small country in terms of area is that there are a pretty wide variety of great day trips that are accessible from London. As I already mentioned above, we had big plans on our two week trip a few years ago to get out of the city and see some other parts of the country... and we ended up spending the entire two weeks in London. On this latest trip, I made it a high priority to get out of the city, and we ended up with a shortlist of three potential day trips: Oxford, Cambridge, and Bath. On our first few days, I asked everyone I could find (tour guides, baristas, bartenders, etc etc) which of the three they'd recommend for our particular interests. We immediately struck Cambridge from the list because the first three people I talked to said some version of \"it's basically a worse Oxford\" (from a tourist perspective - their words, not mine). The choice between Oxford and Bath largely comes down to your particular interests. Bath is further, and has some really nice architecture, particularly Georgian architecture (multiple people said fans of Jane Austen love Bath). And, of course, there are the Roman baths that the city is named after. We ultimately chose Oxford, which is about an hour away on the train and is a beautiful small town with tons of stone architecture and a rich history and culture as one of the oldest universities in Europe. The library inside Christ Church (a major Harry Potter filming location) We're also big Lord of the Rings nerds, and J.R.R. Tolkein was at Oxford as a professor as he wrote The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Another point in Oxford's favor. And we love Harry Potter, and parts of the movies were filmed in Oxford. If you do go to Oxford, I highly recommend a guided tour of the campus (we did this one, which is led by Oxford alumni AND includes Christ Church, where parts of Harry Potter were filmed), which will give you A LOT more insight into the specific history and culture behind what is one of the most famous universities in the world. Catch a Soccer (Football?) Game In addition to high fantasy, another thing that I'm passionate about is soccer. Or football, as it's called in the rest of the English-speaking world. I'm quite literally sitting here at home writing this section with a Premier League game on in the background. The big reason for this latest trip was to catch a few Premier League games with my brother, who is a West Ham fan (COYI). I support Brentford, so we did our best to see both (and succeeded). The first thing you need to know is that Premier League tickets are heavily regulated, and the secondary market is somewhere between nonexistent and illegal (depending on who you talk to) in an effort to preserve prices for season ticket holders. Which means tickets are harder to get than you might be used to if you're coming from an American context. On the bright side, you'll find that tickets are SIGNIFICANTLY more affordable than they are in the US. On the not-so-bright side, it's definitely more complicated to get them, especially for big Premier League games. Here's the gist of it: Tickets are released in waves, first to season ticket holders, then to members, then to previous purchasers, then to the general public (or some variation of this). To get tickets to a game, you have a few options. Become a member of the club (by paying their membership fee - usually around £50) you want tickets for ahead of time, and then wait for tickets to be released to members. Wait until tickets go on sale to the general public and hope that there are still some available. Purchase a \"hospitality package\" that includes some extras and comes at a higher price and skips all of the minutiae above ( P1 Travel was the recommended company). Generally speaking, it is easier to get tickets to lower league games (teams in the Championship of League One, two lower tiers of English soccer) than it is for Premier League games. I've been to Craven Cottage, home of Fulham (and a few good American players over the years, like Clint Dempsey and Antonee Robinson) twice now, and love the intimate nature of the stadium (the front row of seats are basically on the pitch) and the location on the river. We also went to the London Stadium to see West Ham, which was far less charming and interesting (though it's huge). Other clubs to look at other than the big ones (Tottenham, Chelsea, and Arsenal) would be Crystal Palace, Leyton Orient, and Brentford. What to Do with Less Time in London We had almost two full weeks in London, but we realize most people aren't blessed with that much time to explore. Or even able to spend four days. Here's how we'd spend less time in London, from one to three days. You can use these overviews to get an idea of the plan, and then use the detailed sections in the itinerary above to go deeper on the places you end up including. London in a Day With just a day in London, you're really going to have to pick and choose what you do and see, because a day is not nearly enough time. But, we're here to give you our best take on how to spend your time, so let's talk about what a perfect day in London looks like, at least for us. Immediately, we think you should skip the museums. The Natural History Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum are both cool, but they're pretty far away from the rest of Central London. The other thing you're going to have to miss is the Changing of the Guard. First of all, it doesn't happen every single day year-round, so there's a chance that it's not even happening on the day you're in London. Second, having that specific time in mind makes it hard to plan the rest of the day. Instead, focus on exploring the area around the Thames. Start your day at Buckingham Palace, the King's part time residence (we were told by multiple people that he's hardly ever there these days). Make your way to Westminster Abbey from there, and admire Big Ben before walking over the Westminster Bridge. From there, make your way along the south bank of the Thames, following the walk in the main itinerary above. Stop at Borough Market for lunch, then make your way across either London Bridge (better views, specifically of Tower Bridge and the Tower of London), or Tower Bridge (worse views, but a cool experience) and head to the Tower of London. Finally, make your way on a walk through the city of London, and end at St. Paul's Cathedral. With 2 Days With 2 days in London, you'll need to do some swapping around of activities, but you can use the first three days of the itinerary above as a baseline. Here's how we'd do it. On the first day, combine the morning of day 1 (St. Paul's, the London Museum, and the City of London) and the morning of day 2 (Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, and Buckingham Palace). Start with the Westminster stuff to make sure to get to the Abbey early, and end with St. Paul's. Head to Shoreditch for dinner and drinks. On the second day, follow day 3 as written above. If you want to catch a show while you're in town do it on your second evening. With 3 Days With three days, we'd follow the itinerary above as written, and skip day 4 altogether. While it's a bummer to miss out on Camden Market, you're making it to Borough Market, so you've got a taste of London's food markets. If you want to catch a show, you can add it to any of the evenings pretty easily.

Skip to Content Having lived in London for 9 years I never thought I'd write about it in my blog from a travellers point of view.

I get a lot of questions from people that want to visit London in a weekend, so this London 2-day itinerary focuses on all the best things you can do in London in 2 days. It's a packed itinerary with lots of walking, but for anyone wishing to maximise their time in the British capital, this guide has all the information you need to make the most of your 2 days in London.

London 2 day itineary: Day 1 Oxford Street We're starting day one of our 2-day London itinerary at the famous Oxford Street. You want to start your day here fairly early because as time goes on it will get considerably busier. By considerably busier I mean basically hell on earth for anyone that hates crowds like me. So get there nice and sharp in the morning and you'll be able to do some high street shopping without having to queue hours for a changing room. Red buses in Oxford Street, London Piccadilly Circus From Oxford Street you can walk to Oxford Circus, down Regent Street and to the popular Piccadilly Circus. This is London's equivalent of Times Square in New York. With the big bright advertising billboards, multiple road crossings, street buskers and crowds it's quite the sight. An alternative road you can take is the colourful Carnaby Street, it's just parallel to Regent Street and while it's always busy, it's completely pedestrian so it's a bit more pleasant to walk along. Exploring Regent Street in London, UK Leicester Square From Piccadilly Circus it's a very short walk over to Leicester Square. Leicester Square is that place you always see on TV when they do movie premieres in London. There are a number of very cool cinemas here but if you're only in London for 2 days, you probably don't want to spend a couple hours of your time locked up in a dark room. There are loads of quick takeaway food places in Leicester Square but they will most likely be over priced and not that great. Covent Garden Covent Garden is a short 5-minute walk away from Leicester Square and one of the most famous spots in London. The central covered area of Covent Garden, known as the Apple Market, is full of cool shops, bars and restaurants, and also a few touristy but quirky market stalls. The Apple Market in Covent Garden at Christmas Trafalgar Square After Covent Garden you can walk down to Trafalgar Square where you can visit the National Gallery. Entry to museums in London is generally always free, you only pay for the exhibitions that are on at that specific time. If like me you're not a museum person (I'll admit I've only been inside the National Gallery once) Trafalgar Square is still a nice and famous spot of London that you can admire, and from there walk on to your next stop. Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament & Big Ben From Trafalgar Square it's a short walk down to the river, where you will see two of the most iconic London sights. Big Ben is under restructuring works at the moment, but you can still visit Westminster Abby and the Houses of Parliament. Click here to purchase your entrance to Westminster Abbey! The iconic red phone box, red bus and Big Ben in the background (even if he's under construction) The Houses of Parliament and Big Ben under reconstruction works London Eye Just across the river you will see the London Eye, it's hard to miss. In 9 years of living in London I have only been up the London Eye once, but I can say it's really something. Yes it's super touristy, but the view is incredible. You get amazing 360 views over the Thames River, Houses of Parliament and Big Ben on one side, and St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge and the Shard on the other. It's one of the most famous attractions in London, so the queue can get huge. I 100% recommend purchasing tickets online beforehand, so that you can skip the queue. After all, if you only have two days in London, you don't want to waste them queuing around! Click here to purchase your London Eye Fast Track ticket! View over Westminster from the London Eye Borough Market After seeing the London Eye I suggest walking all along the river to Borough Market. You could also take the tube from Waterloo to London Bridge, which would save you some time, but the walk along South Bank is one of the most beautiful spots in London in my opinion. Especially if you're visiting London in summer or on a sunny day, walking along the Thames and seeing the skyline of London is pretty epic. You will see some main landmarks along this walk including the Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe and Millennium Bridge. Millennium Bridge in London, with St Paul's Cathedral in the background Borough Market is a great place to try some of London's famous street food. There are tons of different stalls that sell food from all over the world. It's the perfect place to stop for a quick lunch on the go without wasting hours sitting down at a restaurant and waiting to be served. One of the fresh fruit and vegetables stalls at Borough Market, London The Shard Just next to Borough Market is the Shard, a skyscraper with 95 floors and one of the best views over London. There is a viewing platform on the 70 th floor, the tickets cost between 24 GBP and 32 GBP depending on how far in advance you book them. However, there are a couple bars in the Shard just a couple floors below that you can access for free. Cocktails are around 15 - 20 GBP which is expensive, but considering you're at the highest bar in London, it could be much worst. I'd recommend going to the bar instead of the viewing platform since you end up paying a similar price, but at least you get a drink while you enjoy the view. If a cocktail doesn't fit your travel plans, book your ticket to The Shardviewing deck here! The view over London from the Shard Tower Bridge From the Shard it's a short walk across More London Place to reach Tower Bridge. If you're visiting in summer they usually have a Mexican food truck down next to the river with sun bed chairs, and they often have shows on in The Scoop (the round theatre-like area along the river). From along the river you can walk right up to Tower Bridge and then you'll see a set of stairs that you have to walk up to cross the river. Prime sunset spot over Tower Bridge and the Thames Tower of London This is where I admit that I haven't actually visited the Tower of London yet. I've walked past the Tower of London numerous times, been on river cruises that set off from Tower Pier (a lot of university student clubs do that), even been ice skating at the Tower of London, but I've never been inside. If you want to see the Crown Jewels and learn more about the Tower of London you will have to go inside, however if you're happy with just seeing it walking around it is enough. Click here to book a visit to the Tower of London & Crown Jewels Exhibition! Tower Bridge and the Tower of London at golden hour Sky Garden You're probably thinking these are quite a lot of things to do in one day so don't worry, we have arrived at the last stop of this London itinerary. From Tower of London it's less than a 10-minute walk to Sky Garden. Similarly to the Shard Sky Garden also has epic views over London, just from the opposite side of the river. Access is always free but if you visit during the day you have to book a ticket beforehand with specific time slot, after 6PM you can visit on a free walk-in basis but there is a fairly strict smart casual dress code. Drinks are fairly pricey at the bars in Sky Garden but once again, considering the venue it could be much worst. I recommend trying to get here for sunset since watching the sun go down over London, turning everything golden, and then the skyline slowly lighting up is pretty magical. View over the roofs of London from Sky Garden I've embedded below a map of this walking itinerary, or you can click here to open it in Google Maps. As you can see this big long list of things to do only adds up to about two hours of walking time. Obviously it depends on how long you decide to spend in every location. Whether you want to go on a crazy shopping spree on Oxford Street or spend hours inside the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, but roughly speaking the above itinerary can be done in one day and would make for a perfect start to your 2 days in London. London 2 day itinerary: Day 2 I hope you're not knackered by yesterday's activities, because you have another full day of excitement awaits! Portobello Market For your second day in London we're moving away a bit from the hustle and bustle of central London and starting our day in Portobello. Portobello is a lovely area of London with cute colourful houses and a popular market.The market and shops in Portobello sell all sorts of cool vintage things but also the standard street food and touristy souvenirs. The coloured houses of Portobello Road, London Notting Hill Portobello is just around the corner from the beautiful white houses of Notting Hill. There isn't one specific spot that you must see; it's just a beautiful area of London that you can walk around for a bit and admire the Victorian architecture of these beautiful London streets. If you want, you can also join a guided walking tour of Notting Hill. It's a great way to make sure you see all the prettiest spots, with a local guide teaching you about the history of the area. Click here to book your NottingHill walking tour! The beautiful white houses of Notting Hill, London Hyde Park After Notting Hill you will arrive at Hyde Park, London's most famous and biggest park (in central London anyway). If you're visiting in summer or on a sunny day you will find crowds of Londoners basking in the sun. Even in winter it's a very peaceful area and you can enjoy the beauty of it walking around Kensington Palace and the Serpentine. Click here to book your visit to Kensington Palace in Hyde Park South Kensington & the museums Just make sure that you're crossing the park in the right direction so that when you pop out on the other side you're right next to South Kensington and all the museums. Walk past the Royal Albert Hall (a pretty stunning building in itself) and you'll reach the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum. They're all very different in style and seeing all the exhibitions inside all of the museums would take days. The Royal Albert Hall, London Unfortunately you only have 2 days in London but its still worth popping inside one or two of the museums depending on your interests. I'm a personal fan of the Natural History Museum and their dinosaur display. Entry to the permanent exhibitions is free anyway you can just go in and wander around for a bit without feeling like you have to see everything in one go since you paid a ticket for it (or is that just me?) If you're visiting London at Christmas they always put up a beautiful ice rink at the Natural History Museum where you can try ice-skating. The Natural History Museum in London from outside Harrods Once you're done exploring the museums it's time to walk on to the famous Harrods. Harrods is a huge department store founded in 1824 where they sell all sorts of things. One thing to note is that Harrods is very expensive. While I wouldn't recommend buying anything there I still think it's a pretty cool place to see and wander around for a bit, especially if it's your first time in London and you only have two days. Buckingham Palace From Harrods you can walk through Green Park and arrive at Buckingham Palace in less than 20 minutes. Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the royal family. If you time your visit right you might also be able to see the change of the guard outside the Buckingham Palace gates. You can also visit the State Rooms of Buckingham Palace. If you're interested in history and the Royal Family, it's a very fun and interesting visit! Book your visit to Buckingham Palace here! My first and last trip to Buckingham Palace in 7 years of living in London That's all the walking I've got in store for you today, wasn't that bad was it? I've included the map with walking itinerary below or click here to see it on Google Maps. It's around 1.5 hours of walking but depending on how long you want to spend inside the museums or shopping inside Harrods, it can take up the whole day. Cool things to do in London not included in this London 2 day itinerary As I previously mentioned the British capital is pretty huge and seeing all of London in two days isn't very realistic. There are some areas of London that I personally love but haven't included in my London 2-day itinerary since they're not considered the main tourist attractions and landmarks. However, if for example you want to see some markets and aren't interested in museums you can skip South Kensington and visit the quirky Shoreditch or Camden instead. Most of these areas are very popular in evenings so you can always visit them after the itineraries I wrote above. Shoreditch Shoreditch is the hipster and artsy area of London. There are tons of cool bars, restaurants, pubs, clubs and shops all over the neighbourhood. It's a cool area to wander around during the day to explore the vintage and design shops and colourful graffiti, but it's especially popular in evenings. The nightlife in Shoreditch never disappoints. A very Shoreditch donut shop with colourful graffiti facade Camden Town & Market Camden was the hipster and edgy area of London before Shoreditch become popular. There's a big market with lots of street food, clothes, jewellery, vintage things, home decor, souvenirs and pretty much anything you can think of being sold there. It used to be the rebel punk area (to give you a better idea, Amy Winehouse used to live in Camden) and even today there are still tons of tattoo and piercing parlours. It's become a bit more touristy and less edgy in recent years but is still a cool area to walk around. The market is closed in evenings but there are loads of bars, pubs and clubs and there is a lively nightlife so you can always visit Camden in evenings. Camden Market in London, UK Chinatown Chinatown in London is actually just next to Leicester Square, but I chose not to include it in my London 2-day itinerary as it takes time to explore it properly and it wouldn't have fit in the day 1 schedule. Also the best part of Chinatown is the food so I recommend going around dinnertime to try one of the many Chinese restaurants. Exploring Chinatown in London Soho Soho is another neighbourhood very close to Chinatown and Leicester Square that I chose not to cover in your day 1 itinerary. It's a vibrant and very cool area to explore but you can do so in the evening, discovering all the cool dining and nightlife options. Afternoon tea bus tour Afternoon tea is a very British tradition consisting of savoury sandwiches, cakes, scones and obviously, lots of tea. There are loads of places that do very good afternoon teas in London but inevitably will take up a large chunk of your day (if you're a fast eater like me, you might not love afternoon tea, it's one of those things you're supposed to take slow and enjoy the experience...) If you only have two days in London a good solution is doing an afternoon tea bus tour. This allows you to enjoy the experience while also touring around London and seeing all the main tourist highlights. Click here to book your spot on a B Bakery afternoon tea bus tour! Getting ready for our afternoon tea bus tour in London Our afternoon tea selection on the B Bakery bus tour British Museum The British Museum didn't feature on my essential London 2-day itinerary since it's not quite along the walking routes I'd planned out. However it's not too far don't worry, it's in central London less than a 10-minute walk away from Oxford Street. Entry is free and there are loads of cool things you can see like Rosetta's stone and more. Go for a showboat dinner cruise If you want to spend a bit of a different evening enjoying good food and touring around London, you should definitely do a dinner showboat cruise. As you might have guessed from the name, this is a cruise along the Thames where you will be served dinner as live music and singing takes place. We enjoyed a lovely 4-course dinner while admiring the view over main sights of London, such as the London Eye, St Paul's, Tower Bridge and Greenwich. It combines good food with sightseeing and live music, the perfect evening out in London! Click here to book your showboat dinner cruise! Enjoying my 4-course meal during the showboat dinner cruise See a musical! The West End of London is famous for its theatres and musicals. If you have the time I would highly recommend trying to squeeze in watching a show in your London 2-day itinerary. Over the past 7 years I've been to see The Lion King, Aladdin, Wicked, Billy Elliot and The Phantom of the Opera and they were all pretty amazing. There are tons of shows I still haven't seen myself! Regents Park Regents Park is smaller than Hyde Park and a bit more of a local hangout spot. On one of the park you will find Primrose Hill, where all the Londoners go hang out and have picnics on sunny summer days. View over Regents Park and the London skyline from Primrose Hill St Pauls Cathedral St Pauls Cathedral should have probably featured much higher on my list of things to see in London in two days, however I chose not to include it before since you will be seeing plenty of it even without actually visiting it. As you walk along the river and from all the viewpoints you will be able to see the dome of St Pauls towering over the roofs of London. If you have time you can go see the inside of the cathedral but if not, no harm done (in 7 years I don't think I've ever been inside myself) Click here to book a fast track ticket to StPaul'sCathedral St Paul's Cathedral in London, UK Do a Harry Potter walking tour If you're a Harry Potter fan, you have to do this. I didn't list it in my main 2-day London itinerary because I realise not everyone is as Harry Potter obsessed as I am, but it's definitely worth doing. It will allow you to not only see all the Harry Potter filming locations in London, but you'll also learn some fun facts about the movies. It will go past some of the main London landmarks, so you will still see a lot of London. If you follow my guide, you can easily visit all the filming spots alone, but I personally think it's more fun to do a guided tour. Sharing the experience with other Potter-heads will make it all the more fun! Click here to book your Harry Potter walking tour! Platform 9 and 3/4 in London King's Cross station Visit the Harry Potter Warner Bros Studios This is another activity that is definitely worth mentioning, but given not everyone is a Harry Potter fan, I didn't want to include it in my main London 2-day itinerary. Whether you're a family with children, or a group of millennials who grew up reading the books and watching the Harry Potter movies, the Harry Potter studio tour is great fun. Even though it spoils the magic a little bit, seeing how the movies are made is really interesting. Plus you can stock up on butter beer, chocolate frogs and fun Harry Potter gadgets! It's outside London and planning your transfer there can be a bit complicated, which is why I recommend booking this tour, since it includes both entrance to the studios and transfer there.

Me in 2015 visiting the Harry Potter Warner Bros Studios Logistical tips for your weekend in London What to pack for two days in London Not that there is a shortage of shops in London where you can buy things if you were to forget anything, however there are a couple essentials things that you might want to bring with you for your two days in London. Umbrella: Yes, laugh as much as you want, but the stereotypes of the British capital are unfortunately largely true. It rains a lot here. You don't want to be caught out in the rain so it's just easier to always carry one of those tiny foldable umbrellas with you. Power bank: After all if you're going to be walking around all day, you won't have time to sit down and charge your phone! Also you will need your phone to check Google Maps and that you're headed in the right direction, or what time things close. Comfortable walking shoes: My London 2-day itinerary has a lot of walking involved, so you wan to make sure you to do so in comfortable trainers to avoid having painful feet at the end of the day. St Pancras Renaissance Hotel in London, UK Where to stay in London Despite living in London over the years I've stayed in a number of hotels throughout London, whether with family when they came to visit (and couldn't fit in my tiny student halls room) or more recently with blog collaborations and I can recommend some hotels in London for every budget. However more than a specific hotel I can suggest areas of London where you can stay. If you only have two days in London you will want to stay very central or you will waste time travelling around, if you go a bit further out make sure to be within 5 minutes walking distance to a tube station. Personally I would recommend staying either in Camden, Angel or even more central around Holborn and Bank. Click here to see the latest prices andavailability foraccommodation in London! Leadenhall Market in London, UK Budget accommodation There are tons of hostels in London. I've never personally stayed in one but have heard great things of Wombats. There are also loads of hotel chains with numerous properties around London like Holiday Inn or the Travelodge that are more affordable than independent hotels. The more central ones are a bit more expensive but usually still offer good value for money. Mid-range accommodation Just like there are budget chain hostels and hotels, there are also a number of mid-range chains you can go for like Hilton or Marriott spread all over London. My parents stayed at the Hilton in Angel back when I used to live in the area and loved it, Angel is also a great area to stay as its a bit outside the tourist chaos of London but still within easy reach of all the main attractions. These options are a bit fancier than the previous budget suggestions but at more reasonable prices than the luxury properties in London. Luxury accommodation I spent one night at the St Pancras Renaissance Hotel for a blog collaboration and that was the fanciest place I have slept at in London. The property is beautiful, the service excellent and the location perfect as base to explore London, especially if you only have 2 days in London. I also spent an afternoon at Cheval Three Quays where a friend of mine was staying and can highly recommend it, the apartments are new, have a great view of the Thames and are in a great location to explore London. The Grand Staircase of the St Pancras Renaissance Hotel in London, UK Where to eat in London When I first moved to London from Italy everybody told me how the food in London was shit. Having lived here for 7 years now I can strongly disagree with that. For Italian standards sure there is a lot of junk food out there (I'm looking at you Pizza Hut and your pizzas with burgers in the crust) but there are also a lot of amazing dining options for every budget. London is a very international city and that's reflected in the variety of cuisines you can find. Since you're only in London for two days I wouldn't waste too much time sitting in restaurants, but there are cool and cheap dining options on the go. Street food The street food in London is awesome. There are famous street food markets like Borough Market and Camden Market but you will also find street food trucks here and there all over London, especially in the busy touristy spots. The prices vary massively depending on the cuisine, how big a portion you get, where in London it is and lots of other factors, but I've had meals from street food trucks in London for anywhere between 3 GBP and 10 GBP. The halloumi fries at Camden Market, London Eat on the go If you don't want to eat street food but you also don't want to sit down at a restaurant there are tons of places you can eat on the go in London. All the Pret A Manger, Eat, Wasabi, Itsu, LEON, Pod, Starbucks and other chains you see around serve food fresh and ready to go. They usually have seats inside if you want to take a break from walking around London or you can grab a sandwich and keep going. It obviously depends on how much food you get but you wouldn't generally spend more than 10 GBP for lunch at these places. The scotch egg and sweet potato fries of Borough Market, London Chain restaurants If you want to sit down for a proper meal without spending a fortune, worry not, there are thousands of restaurants all over London, both independent and chains. As a tourist it can be a bit hit and miss going to an independent boutique hotel, as you can't know if they're good or not. While they're less authentic, with chain restaurants you're always sure that a certain standard will be met. The ones of ethnic cuisines are also easier to eat at as the flavours are adapted for Western tastes. Some of my personal favourites are Wagamama, GBK, Wahaca, Franco Manca, Rosa's Thai, Nando's and Pho. Starters at Lima Floral, a Peruvian chain restaurant in London Fancy or Michelin-starred restaurants If you want to go fancy, London can do fancy very well. London has 70 Michelin starred restaurants (and there many more fancy and delicious restaurants that don't have Michelin stars) that you can try. I was a student in London so I can't say I have much experience with these, so you might want to check out this guide by Secret London instead. Enjoying the sunset at the London Eye Do you need travel insurance for 2 days in London? After my personal experience spending two nights in a private hospital in Tenerife, and having to pay for it out of pocket (it wasn't cheap), I always recommend getting travel insurance. You might not end up needing it, but for a small fee you can travel without worries. Personally, I suggest getting your travel insurance with Heymondo. Heymondo offers tailor made travel insurance, providing the best value for money for your specific trip. You can also buy it once you're already abroad and have forgotten about it before flying (which, if you're anything like me, is quite likely). Besides the usual cancellation, medical expenses, luggage coverage and general travel insurance services, Heymondo also has a 24/7 doctor chat and instant assistance through their app. As a Greta's Travels reader, you get 5% off your Heymondo travel insurance ! Click here to get your 5% off Heymondo travel insurance! Exploring Westminster in London How to get into London First things first, how do you get into London? London has six major airports, and depending on where in the city you're staying, it can be quite the journey getting to your accommodation from the airport. If you're flying internationally from a long-haul destination you would usually arrive at Heathrow, whilst if you're flying from a European destination with a low-cost airline you would usually arrive at Luton, Gatwick or Stansted. From all of these major London airports you can catch a train that will take you directly into Central London, usually at either Victoria Station, St Pancras Station or Liverpool Street depending on the airport. However if you're not a train person, you can also check out these coach transfers: Bus Transfer from Gatwick Airport Bus Transfer from Stansted Airport Bus Transfer from Luton Airport PRIVATE Transfer from Heathrow Airport - this is preferable if you're a family travelling with children and don't want to wait for trains or buses! If you're a family or group, getting a private transfer won't be much more expensive than the train, and it will save you time. If you only have two days in London, you don't want to waste time getting into the city! Golden hour over the London Eye and Westminster in London, UK If you want to save money I recommend getting the normal train service as opposed to the express airport ones. For example Gatwick Airport has the Gatwick Express that takes you into Victoria station in half an hour for around 20 GBP. Instead if you get the normal Southern trains service this usually stops at London Bridge, City Thameslink, Farringdon and then St Pancras International and only costs around 10 GBP. I prefer this option because it saves me money and time, since even if the train is a bit slower it does more stops in central London where you can get off and be ready to see the city without having to take public transport from Victoria. Similarly the Heathrow Express costs around 20 GBP and takes you to Paddington, which is pretty far from all the main attractions. If you get the Piccadilly line you will pay around 6 GBP and it takes you straight into central London. To find the most convenient train I always check online on the Trainline. | READ MORE: THE ULTIMATE LONDON BUCKET LIST | Enjoying the sunset over the rooftops of London and St Paul's Cathedral from Madisons Rooftop Bar How to get around London Ok so you've arrived in London, how do you actually move around this huge city? You might think me crazy but the best way to get around London is actually walking! All the main attractions in central London are fairly close to each other, and walking from one to the other actually allows you to see the beautiful architecture around and take in the London atmosphere. Transport for London actually put together a map with the walking times between tube stations in London (tube - that's what Londoners call the underground system here). Admittedly some are pretty far but look at the centre of zone 1, some stops are only 3 minutes away from each other! | READ MORE: THE MOST BEAUTIFUL & PHOTOGENIC PLACES IN LONDON | London tube map that shows the walking times between stations, image by TfL If you don't want to walk London has a very efficient public transport system. Both the tube and buses run super regularly and cover pretty much every corner of central London. You can get an Oyster travel card or if you have a contactless credit or debit card you can tap that to get on buses and in the tube. Per journey you pay 1.50 GBP for the bus or from 2.40 GBP upwards for the tube depending what zone you travel to. TfL put a daily cap in place at 7 GBP, which means after three tube journeys you're not paying anymore for additional trips. You can also find black cabs and ubers everywhere in London but I personally only take them in evenings if I'm going home late. Getting in a car in central London during the day basically means wasting your whole day given the traffic situation. Ubers are also generally cheaper than black cabs. Sunset with a view over Tower Bridge and the Shard in London, UK Final thoughts on my London in 2 days itinerary Have you been to London before? How did you find it? Let me know in the comments below! Conscious this London 2-day itinerary turned into a pretty huge guide so if you have any questions, just let me know, happy to help if I can.

If you follow me on Instagram, you know by now that I just got back from an amazing four days in London with my little girl. I'm so excited to share with you the things we did and saw, and my top recommendations for this wonderful city. In case you missed it, the reason we were in London was because Charlie had a work trip there. I was planning on holding down the fort alone, but Eleanor's passport came in way sooner than anticipated. When her passport came in, I thought to myself, would it be the craziest thing ever to fly to London with my four-month-old alone (Charlie's flight had a layover and I knew we wouldn't want that?)? And basically do a solo trip with her there? The answer is yes - it absolutely is and was crazy, and it was worth every single second of it! If you haven't been to London, it is one of the world's largest and most vibrant cities with SO much to do. Due to needing to test negative for COVID to get back into the United States, we opted to do almost everything outdoors during our four days in London. Thankfully, London is known for its gorgeous architecture, markets and amazing parks so there was plenty to keep us busy! Even without COVID, I highly recommend making the time to check out all of the parks, markets, palaces and historical sites. Getting to London One of the best parts of London is how EASY it is to get there! It has a huge international airport (Heathrow) which makes it an ideal spot for an international trip. Once you arrive at Heathrow, you have a few options for how to get downtown. The first option is taking a taxi. This is going to be the most expensive option and depending on when you arrive, the traffic from Heathrow to downtown London is really not great. It can take up to two hours to get downtown! For that reason, I don't recommend taking a taxi to your hotel. The fastest and most stress-free way to get from Heathrow to London is the dedicated airport train, the Heathrow Express. This takes just 15 minutes from Heathrow to Paddington Station running every 15 minutes. Once you get to Paddington Station, you can take a taxi, Uber, or walk to you hotel. This is what we did, and it was SO easy to figure out! You can buy a round-trip or one-way trip ticket here. One thing to note is that if you book your Heathrow Express journey at least 90 days in advance, you could get a one-way ticket for just £5.50! Getting Around London There are lots of ways to get around during your four days in London. First, you should know London has an AMAZING public transportation system! This includes their bus system and train (\"the tube\"). I opted not to spend much time on the tube because not all of their train stations have elevators (or \"lifts\" as they call them). I would have a stroller with me from walking around with Eleanor, so that would be a challenge. If you plan on going alone, or want to wear your baby, then the tube is a great option. You can buy individual tickets for each ride, but many people visiting the city get an Oyster Card. This allows you to travel on almost all of London's public transit options and can save you both time and money. Personally, I was SHOCKED by how walkable London was and think the best way to get around is by foot! With the exception of the hop-on hop-off bus, and one taxi ride, we walked everywhere. Another way to get around is by Uber or their Black Cabs! You can use the app FREE NOW to call a taxi - it's very similar to the Uber app. If you're traveling with a baby/kids, one thing that's nice about taking a taxi is you can simply put your entire stroller in the backseat (standing up and locked - it doesn't need to be folded or anything!). This just makes getting around SO much easier and more seamless. I definitely do NOT recommend driving yourself around London. There are congestion fees in downtown London, parking is insanely expensive, and traffic can be a nightmare. Save yourself the time and money! Where We Stayed I LOVED where we stayed in London. Let me emphasize that London is a very expensive city. If it weren't for Charlie's employer paying for him to stay in this hotel, we probably would have worked harder to find a more budget-friendly hotel. That said, this hotel was amazingly centrally-located and extremely nice. We stayed at the London Hilton on Park Lane in Mayfair. It was located right next to Hyde Park, and across the street from Buckingham Palace. London Itinerary Day 1: Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Parliament Square We took a redeye flight on Sunday night and arrived in London around 7AM local time. From the airport, we took the Heathrow Express to Paddington station. While it would have been easier to catch a cab with all of our luggage and stroller, we were SO excited to be in London and decided to walk to our hotel to drop our luggage off (check-in wasn't until 3PM). I've found that the best way to avoid jet-lag is to just force yourself to stay awake as long as possible until it's a reasonable time to go to bed. So, we avoided napping! Stroll Through Hyde Park As I mentioned above, London has so many gorgeous parks, and Hyde Park is one of them. I highly recommend walking through Hyde Park and people watching. Hyde Park is one of London's eight Royal Parks - it covers 350 acres, and offers so much greenery, flower gardens, walking and biking paths, and a playground. You'll also see people riding horses! Visit Buckingham Palace After walking through Hyde Park, we walked over to visit Buckingham Palace. As you probably know, Buckingham Palace is the most famous palace in the UK. It serves as the primary London residence for the reigning sovereign of the United Kingdom. If you want to see the Changing of the Guard, you can check out this schedule. Regardless, I highly recommend at least walking past Buckingham Palace and taking it all in! Walk to Parliament Square (Big Ben and Westminster Abbey) From Buckingham Palace, we walked over to Parliament Square. This square is a really popular/busy one and issurrounded by famous buildings. This includes Westminster Abbey, the United Kingdom Supreme Court, the UK Supreme Court, and the Houses of Parliament (which is where you'll see Big Ben!). It was so exciting getting to see so many famous London spots that were on our list within just a few minutes! Westminster Abbey is one of England's most famous churches, and the architecture is stunning (see picture below). If you plan to visit Westminster Abbey, make sure you leave extra time to get in and see everything as it is a popular place and it takes a while to explore. You can skip the ticket line by getting your ticket online in advance here. St. James's Park From Parliament Square, we started making our way back to the hotel in Mayfair because it was almost finally time to check in! We walked through St. James's Park to get back in the direction of the hotel. This is another one of London's eight Royal Parks, and I just can't get enough of all of London's gorgeous green space! We made our way back to the hotel and picked up sandwiches at Pret on the way back. Charlie went off to a work meeting and dinner, and Eleanor and I passed out early because we were exhausted from the time difference. We also knew we had a full day of exploring ahead of us the next day! London Itinerary Day 2: Tower Bridge, Tower of London, Borough Market Hop-On Hop-Off Bus On my second day in London, Eleanor and I decided to use the hop-on hop-off bus with Big Bus Tours and it was amazing!! This was my first time doing a hop-on hop-off bus tour, and I couldn't recommend it more. It included headphones and an audio tour throughout the route. It was such an easy way to see so much of the city and learn about the different neighborhoods and location. I really got a feel for London by doing this! I knew I wanted to see the Tower of London this day. Because it was on the opposite side of town, taking a taxi would have been extremely expensive. Similarly, taking a bus or tube would have been overwhelming with the stroller, lack of elevators, etc. So, this was perfect! Tower Bridge We took the Hop-On Hop-Off Bus to stop 17, which was the Tower of London. We walked over to the Tower and right in front of it, you have a PERFECT view of the Tower Bridge, which is London's most iconic bridge. Many people think this bridge is the London Bridge, but it's actually not! Tower of London Visiting the Tower of London was one of my favorite parts of the entire trip. The Tower of London is described as \"a secure fortress, royal palace and infamous prison where you can explore 1000 years of history.\" You can buy tickets either outside of the Tower, or from the hop-on hop-off bus company I recommended above once you get off the bus. Once you're there, you can visit the world-famous Crown Jewels or you can just walk around outside and take in the amazing architecture and read the plaques. The ladder is what I chose to do! I should also note that if you are bringing a stroller, it is extremely bumpy and filled with cobblestones. Thankfully, there is a spot where you can leave your strollers. I recommend bringing a baby carrier and packing light so that you can carry your valuables along with you. London Bridge & Borough Market Once we were finished visiting the Tower of London, we crossed the Thames River via London Bridge and walked over to Borough Market. Borough Market is the most popular and one of the oldest markets in the entire United Kingdom! If you're looking for a place to eat, this is the spot. Borough Market has tons of food stalls and also is filled with baked goods, cheeses, fresh produce, and more. While at Borough Market, I stopped for lunch at fish! Borough Market because I was DYING for some classic English fish & chips! Wow, it did NOT disappoint. I was so happy to sit down, enjoyed some fried cod and \"chips\" (fries), their classic mashed peas, and an aperol spritz. Highly recommend! From here, I started walking over to the closest pick-up spot for the hop-on hop-off bus and headed back to the hotel. I met up with Charlie after his day of work meetings and we walked over to a Tapas bar right near our hotel called El Pirata for a Pimms Cup (a classic London cocktail!), pan con tomate, and papas bravas. It was a really great local spot sitting on a side street near our hotel. It just felt really authentic and nottouristy at all! London Itinerary Day 3: Piccadilly Street/Circus, Covent Garden, All the Food! This was one of my absolute favorite days while there! I didn't take any public transit this day or any buses/cars, and got everywhere by foot. It was SO fun walking around and exploring/getting lost in the city. Here's what we did on day three! Fortnum & Mason I left the hotel early in the morning and walked down Piccadilly Street, which is one of the most icon streets in the city! It has a ton of nice hotels, royal parks, world-class museums, and fancy department stores. While walking down the street, I stopped into Fortnum & Mason which is a fancy department store with tons of treats and goodies. Of course, I picked up some chocolates to bring to the park later - there was SO. MUCH. CHOCOLATE. there!! Walking around, there was classical music playing and all I could think to myself was how amazing this place would be during Christmas. It really felt like something out of a movie and I recommend stopping here. Covent Garden From Fortnum & Mason, we kept walking and walked all the way to Covent Garden which I LOVED. It was my favorite market of all the ones I visited that trip. There were so many cute craft vendors with little trinkets, and then more luxurious shops like Jo Malone and more. I found a little spot outside in the square to sit with Eleanor and get an aperol spritz after walking around the market. On the way to Covent Garden from Fortnum & Mason, you'll also pass Piccadilly Circus which is a famous town square in London. It is said to be like the \"Times Square of London.\" This is definitely not somewhere I'd enjoy spending much time, but a must-see nonetheless! Lunch at Dishoom Did you know that London is known for its Indian food?! When I posted I was going to London, I got ~100 messages on my Instagram letting me know that I HAVE to eat at Dishoom, which serves small Indian plates. I didn't have intentions of eating at a ton of restaurants while visiting, but I knew I wanted to eat at Dishoom. There is a Covent Garden location, so it was really easy to just walk right over after visiting the market! Wow, this might have been one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. I recommend making a reservation in advance. Based on all of your recommendations, I ordered the House Black Daal, Chicken Berry Britannia, and Bowl of Greens. OMG. Drooling just thinking about it, and couldn't recommend this restaurant more! Bask in Green Park After eating at Dishoom, I walked over to Green Park, which is another Royal Park in London! It is right next to Buckingham Palace. While you're there, you can rent a \"deck chair\" (or lawn chair) and sit and people watch/soak in the sun in this gorgeous park. I packed along my Gathre mat which I bring everywhere, found a spot in the shade, and read my book while Eleanor got in some tummy time. I loved the vibe in this park. Dinner at Dalloway Terrace If you're looking to have dinner at a restaurant that feels like you're sitting in Anthropologie, look no further than Dalloway Terrace. We made a reservation based off a recommendation from an Instagram friend, and took a black cab over here for an outdoor dinner. The terrace is filled with the most exquisite flower wall and it felt magical in there. I recommend an aperol spritz, the buffalo burrata appetizer, and the Thai green coconut curry London Itinerary Day 4: Harrods, Kensington Gardens/Palace, Afternoon Tea Charlie left for Amsterdam for more work meetings this morning, so it was another wonderful day strolling London with my daughter. This time, we went west from our hotel and checked out a whole different area of the city! Harrods Even if you don't like shopping, you have to check out Harrods. It's one of the most famous luxury department stores in the world. It was founded by Charles Harrod in 1835 and grew to be the best-known British department store in the world. It has been visited by celebrities, politicians, royalty, and the British elite. If you visit Harrods, you NEED to go to the food hall! It is an unbelievable food emporium and the perfect place to pick up to-go food and bring for a picnic. Even if you aren't planning to eat there, it's definitely worth a visit! Kensington Gardens & Palace, Princess Diana Memorial Fountain Of all the parks I visited, Kensington Gardens was my favorite! The gardens are another one of London's royal parks and covers 265 acres. It's a beautiful green space and if the weather is nice, I recommend just strolling around. While you're in Kensington Gardens, walk on over to the Kensington Palace. Kensington Palace a grand 17th century home that was first used as a royal residence by King William II and Queen Mary II. It continued to be used as a royal residence by a British monarch through the reign of King George II. Since then, it has been used as the residence and workplace of \"minor royalty\", and is still an active working royal palace. Another place you'll be able to visit while in the Gardens is the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. This is technically in Hyde Park, but very close to the Kensington Palace! Afternoon Tea at Number Sixteen in South Kensington I knew I wanted to go to afternoon tea while in London, but it was overwhelming how many places there were to do it! When someone on Instagram recommended Number Sixteen to me and told me it was outside in a garden, I was immediately sold. Wherever you go, you should definitely make reservations in advance! If you don't know what afternoon tea is, it originated in the aristocratic homes of England in the 19th century. It is a light meal composed of sandwiches, scones with butter and jam, sweet pastries, and tea (you can also get champagne if you so choose!). Number Sixteen was just a short walk from Kensington Gardens, so it worked out perfectly into the structure of our day! The setting of the tea was just stunning. Grab a Coffee at EL&N EL&N is known for being \"the most Instagrammable cafe in the world\" - and this is extremely accurate! On the walk from afternoon tea back to the hotel, I walked right past EL&N and decided to stop inside for a latte to-go for the walk home. I recommend finding time to stop by and grab a coffee or pastry here. It was SO cute! In London, there is something called a \"Meal Deal\" offered by most local grocery stores. While there, because I wanted to save money on meals, I took advantage of this from Tesco (a local supermarket). The deal is that for just £3, you can get a sandwich, snack (chips or fruit, for example) and soda! This went such a long way in helping me save money while I was there. London Itinerary Day 5: Heading Home! On the fifth day, it was time to head back to the United States. This was quite the long day of travel, alone with a four-month-old. I woke up, took a black cab to Paddington Station, and took the Heathrow Express to the airport. I then flew from Heathrow back to Washington Dulles. Overall, it was such a lovely time and I'm so glad I decided to go on this trip. I was absolutely terrified and felt insane for taking what was essentially a solo international trip with my four-month-old daughter. But, I'm SO so so happy I just went for it. It's been less than four days since returning home and I already don't remember the hassle of getting back, but know the memories I made there will last me a lifetime. Not feeling an international trip? Check out this itinerary I shared recently for a week in coastal Maine!"}]}

Having lived in London for almost a decade now, I've come to enjoy its varying neighborhoods and thriving creative scene. And I'm still not over being able to walk past centuries-old historic corners. Whether cozying up beside the fireplace in a pub on a cold winter's evening or making the most of long summer days in the city's green spaces, London is perfect to visit any time of the year. If you're heading to London for the first time, I always recommend three days as the perfect taster trip. It gives you enough time to see the iconic sights the city is known for, enjoy a few quintessential London activities, and visit some of the city's best neighborhoods. This itinerary will guide you through how to make the most of that time in England's capital. London is a big city and with dozens of museums, plenty of monuments, and hundreds of incredible coffee shops, restaurants, and pubs, narrowing down exactly what to see can feel like a challenge. That's where this itinerary for 3 days in London will help you maximize your time in the British capital. Short on Time?

From how to best navigate the destinations on this itinerary to when to visit, these are some tips to ensure you have a great trip to London. How to Get Around One of the things I love most is how well-connected London is. The tube takes you from east to west and north to south on colorful lines that intersect throughout the city. Those cherry-red double-decker buses take you from A to B above ground, and you can even take in the sights from the Thames via a river boat. And of course, you can walk between destinations too when they're closer together. Oyster is London's tap-on/tap-off public transport payment system. You can top up a card and use it to tap on and off for most journeys (you only need to tap on but not off for buses) and it will charge you based on your journey. Alternatively, your credit card can also be used the same way if your provider allows it. Book Tickets for Attractions in Advance If you're planning to visit popular attractions such as the Tower of London, it's recommended to book your ticket in advance. Sometimes tickets sell out in advance or you may spend time waiting in long queues, so choosing your date and (sometimes time) for entry is advisable. Check Which Airport Most international flights will arrive/depart at London Heathrow or London Gatwick airports, however five airports are typically listed for flights to and from London, especially if you're arriving from European destinations. London Heathrow and London City are the most convenient and well-connected airports that are closer to central London. I'd recommend avoiding flights to/from London Stansted or London Luton airports, as they are quite far north of the city. Day 1: Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, and Covent Garden Big Ben and Westminster Abbey The best place to start your trip to London is in the historic and iconic area of Westminster. Home to the Houses of Parliament and Elizabeth Tower (where you'll find Big Ben), it's best to arrive here early in the morning. As black cabs and red double-deckers drive over Westminster Bridge, it will feel like scenes straight out of a movie. From Westminster Bridge, you can also spot the London Eye in Southbank. From there, make your way to Westminster Abbey. Considered an architectural masterpiece with styles from the 13th to 16th centuries, it's a treasure of London. You can choose to take a guided tour and visit the interior which will highlight the history of the Abbey as well as showcase numerous historical artifacts through several exhibitions. Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park London is known for its green spaces and the next part of your day will take you through a few of them. Walking through St James Park from Westminster Abbey you'll spot ponds, shaded park spaces, and swans. In spring and summer, the gardens are in bloom with beautiful floral displays and it's the perfect place for a picnic lunch. At the opposite end of St James Park is Buckingham Palace. The official residence of His Majesty King Charles III, and one of the top spots for tourists to visit in London. For a few weeks each summer you can also book to visit the state rooms, usually from July to September. From Buckingham Palace, head across the road and you'll enter Hyde Park. Enjoy an afternoon out on a boat or pedalo in The Serpentine, wander through the rose garden, or enjoy royal high tea at Kensington Palace. There are also several cafes and huts selling drinks and ice creams making it a great spot for a sunny afternoon. If you're into history, the Churchill War Rooms is also located on the edge of the park and offers an immersive look into what life was like during the Second World War. Covent Garden Covent Garden is a must-visit while in London. Home to The Apple Market, several west-end shows, and plenty of restaurants, cafes, and shops, it's a great place to wind up your day. From Hyde Park, you can jump on the tube and head here. There are regular exhibitions from local artists on display in the market building or piazza, as well as pop-up events celebrating everything from Wimbledon to Christmas. The area is home to some great cafes and coffee shops, including Grind, Fair Shot Cafe, and Monmouth Coffee. I also recommend grabbing a freshly baked cinnamon bun from Buns from Home. Covent Garden is a great spot for dinner with plenty of choice of cuisine. Some of my personal favorites are Ave Mario serving up Italian in a boldly decorated interior, SUSHISAMBA which has a lovely open terrace in a Grade II listed building, and Dishoom which offers modern Indian cuisine. To end your day, walk down towards Waterloo Bridge and take in the scenes along the Thames where the London Eye is lit up at night. Day 2: Tower Bridge, Tower of London, Sky Garden, Borough Market, Piccadilly and Soho Tower Bridge and Tower of London In the morning start with a coffee at WatchHouse Coffee, before heading to one of London's defining landmarks, Tower Bridge. With its two towers and sky-blue and white beams, it's a stunning architectural addition to London's skyline. If you want to, you can visit the two towers and walk across the glass walkway above the road below for a unique view of the bridge. From here, head over to the north side of the Thames to the Tower of London. Home to the Crown Jewels and steeped in history, this castle has been UNESCO Heritage listed and is home to the Ravens who are known as the guardians of the Tower. You can easily spend one to two hours visiting the Tower of London. Sky Garden There are several iconic places to get a bird's eye view of London, but my favorite is Sky Garden. This viewpoint has 360-degree views across the city, two bars, and a restaurant, all among a lush indoor botanical garden. I don't recommend eating here, as your next stop is all about food, and you'll want to save space. Tickets to Sky Garden are available three weeks in advance and are free, but you do need to book a timed entry. Borough Market Head across London Bridge and straight to Borough Market for lunch. In the last 30 years or so, this historic market has become a mainstay of London's food scene, filled with dozens of brilliant food and drink stalls, as well as brick-and-mortar stores, cafes, and restaurants. For a lighter lunch, I recommend the gooey grilled cheese sandwiches from Kappacasein or the slow-cooked meat baguettes from Hobbs Roast. If you're looking for something more substantial, Agora souvla bar offers great Greek dishes based around a charcoal rotisserie, or Brindisa Kitchen Bar serves classic Spanish cuisine. For those with a sweet tooth, Humble Crumble is a must-try thanks to its farmers market fruity base topped with crunchy crumble and vanilla custard. Lastly, if you're a fan of modern design, the Millennium Bridge and Tate Modern Museum are also on this side of town and worth considering a visit. Piccadilly Circus and Soho Piccadilly is the home of London's theater scene and the iconic neon-lit square that earned the 'circus' part of the area's name. The most remarkable thing about these light-up billboards is that they're never turned off, they run 24/7. There are numerous theaters in the area showing some of the most popular musicals in the world, including Les Miserables, Matilda, and The Book of Mormon. It's worth checking out if there are any shows you'd like to catch while in town. From Piccadilly Circus, you can explore the surrounding areas including Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery, over to Regent and Oxford Streets for shopping, or Leicester Square. Fortnum and Mason and Liberty of London are must-visit stores that showcase some of the UK's best produce and a great place to pick up some souvenirs to take home. If you're visiting in December, Fortnum and Mason also have an excellent Christmas display and decorations that are worth visiting. Soho is a great place to end your day due to its vibrant dining scene. Foodies will appreciate the abundance of choice in cuisine from Italian and Indian to Iranian and Japanese. A few recommendations I'd suggest include Berenjak for Iranian grilled tandoor, grab Spanish at Barrafina, and vegetarians will love Mildreds. Generally, Greek Street has great restaurant offerings and I recommend making a reservation if you have your heart set on eating somewhere in particular. Day 3: Kensington, Museums, Notting Hill and Afternoon Tea Kensington and V&A or Natural History Museum You can't visit London without stopping by at least one museum and best of all, many are free to enter. While there are dozens to choose from, my favorites are located in South Kensington; the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Natural History Museum. The first is great for art lovers and offers a range of paid temporary exhibitions, from musical icons to fashion powerhouses. The Natural History Museum is perfect for families, with displays ranging from botany to zoology and science and several interactive exhibits. If you want to grab breakfast before heading to one of the museums, Farm Girl and Coco Momo are great brunch options in Kensington. Notting Hill Staying in West London, head over to Notting Hill. Much loved by locals and visitors alike, the colorful mews and townhouses make this the insta-perfect spot. Notting Hill has numerous great eateries making a good place to stop for lunch today. Akub offers delicious Palestinian cuisine in a quaint street, Orasay is a great seafood restaurant inspired by the Outer Hebrides, or try out Taqueria for low-key Mexican dining. If your itinerary in London falls on a Saturday, Portobello Road Market runs along the street with stall holders selling handcrafted goods, antiques, vintage cameras, and tons of food choices. It can become quite busy, especially when the weather is great, so I'd recommend starting here in the morning and then heading to Kensington afterward. Even if you don't visit Notting Hill on a Saturday, there are loads of independent shops and boutiques worth browsing. Traditional Afternoon Tea If there's one thing that feels quintessentially British, it's afternoon tea in London. Finger sandwiches, scones with jam and clotted cream, and a good brew are the perfect way to spend an afternoon and it's a year-round activity that can't be dampened by bad weather. When it comes to choosing where to enjoy afternoon tea, you're spoiled for choice. For a timeless classic, I highly recommend afternoon tea at The Palm Parlour at The Ritz. The Drawing Room at Brown's Hotel has a great atmosphere without needing to be overly formal, and Dean Street Townhouse offers a budget-friendly afternoon tea option under £50 per person. As your trip draws to a close, you can either spend your final hours wandering around neighborhoods like Marylebone with its upscale restaurants and boutiques or wander along the Thames at Southbank.

The booths are positioned in front of a row of buildings, which appear to be made of stone or brick and feature ornate architectural details. The sidewalk itself is paved with large stones, giving it a sense of age and character. As we move further into the image, we notice a group of people walking along the sidewalk, some of whom are dressed in business attire while others wear casual clothing. This suggests that the scene is set during the daytime, possibly during a weekday when people are going about their daily routines. Behind the telephone booths, a row of streetlights lines the sidewalk, casting a warm glow over the scene.

With its iconic skyline, trendy neighborhoods, world-class museums, and long list of popular attractions, London is a city that every traveler should visit. We put together this 5-day London itinerary to help you have the best experience here. In general, we grouped sites together based on their location in order to save you time walking and using public transportation. This will keep you from spending unnecessary time on London's metro (aka the Tube and the Underground) and backtracking through the city. Also, we grouped some of the most expensive activities into days 2, 3, and 4, so you can take advantage of the London Pass (more about this at the end of the post). Also, at the end of this post, we give recommendations on how to shorten this London itinerary if you only have 2, 3, or 4 days to spend in London. The provided walking distances are the amount of walking you will do to get between sites. These do not include the amount of walking you will do inside museums, art galleries, etc. 5 Day London Itinerary Day 1: Arrive in London, Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour, the London Eye Day 2: Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Whitehall, Covent Garden Day 3: Tower of London, Tower Bridge, Borough Market, Tate Modern, St. Paul's Cathedral, Sky Garden Day 4: National Gallery, Greenwich, Prime Meridian, Up at the O2 Day 5: British Museum, Afternoon Tea, Portobello Road Market, Museums in Kensington Table of Contents Toggle London Itinerary: Day 1 Arrive in London Depending on your flight, most likely you will arrive in London in the morning. Check into your hotel and get settled. Only take a nap if you desperately need one. It's better to drink some coffee and stay awake so you can adjust to the time change as quickly as possible. It's amazing what getting out into the sunshine can do to revive tired travelers. However, it is London, so there is the chance that the sun will be hidden behind the clouds. To get to your hotel from the airport, you can take a taxi or hire a private driver (expensive, about 45 minutes, but most likely will be longer depending on traffic), take the Underground (cheap, about 1 hour), or take the Heathrow Express to Paddington station and then take the Underground to your hotel (about 45 minutes but varies depending on hotel location). Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour Normally, we do not recommend bus tours. Unless you are in London. This city is huge and the list of sites to see is long. Taking a bus tour is a great way to get an overview of this amazing city. Plus, it's the perfect, low-key activity for jet-lagged travelers. There are multiple companies that offer Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tours. Big Bus, Golden Tour, and The Original Tour are the most popular. We recommend Big Bus, only because this is whom we used and we had a good experience. Most companies offer multiple routes through the city. Tickets are valid for one, two, and three days, and extra excursions may be added in, such as a river ride on the Thames. For the purpose of today, all you need is a basic 24-hour ticket. To get an overview of the city, I recommend the Red Route with Big Bus. This route takes you past the main sites without going too far out of the way. Enjoy the journey as you glide by Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral, Buckingham Palace, and the River Thames. PRO TRAVEL TIP: If you purchase your tickets online in advance, you will save money compared to purchasing them same-day on the city street. Take a Ride on the London Eye A ride on the London Eye is another ultra-touristy thing to do in London, but if this is your first time in the city, it's thrilling to look down on the River Thames, Parliament, and over the London skyline. London Eye | 5 Day London Itinerary Cost: Tickets start at £29 if you book in advance. If you want to skip the line, choose the Fast Track option (slightly more expensive). Tickets are available on the official website and through GetYourGuide. Hours: 10:00 am - 8:30 pm, although hours change frequently depending on the season. Visit the London Eye website for more information. Getting here: Use the bus tour to get here, hop off and ride the London Eye, and then hop back on the bus to complete the loop back to your hotel (or your starting destination). Have dinner and go to bed early to get that much needed sleep.

Com From Westminster Abbey, walk through St. James's Park to The Mall (1.1 km, 0.7 miles, about 15 minutes) to Buckingham Palace. Most visits here are quick, with just a view of the Palace through the fence, but if you get your timing right, you can watch the Changing of the Guard. The Changing of the Guard occurs every other day at 11 am (usually Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday). In the summer, the Changing of the Guard may occur daily. This schedule can change and the ceremony will not occur in inclement weather. Click here for the up to date schedule. The Changing of the Guard is a ceremony that takes place between St. James's Palace and Buckingham Palace. The ceremony starts at 10:30 am at St. James's Palace, at 10:45 the procession enters The Mall and walks towards Buckingham Palace, and at 11 am the official Changing of the Guard occurs at Buckingham Palace. You can watch this ceremony on the Mall and in front of Buckingham Palace. It helps to get here early (as much as an hour early during the very busy summer months) to get a good spot. If you want to watch the Changing of the Guard from the best vantage points and learn more about this tradition, this walking tour gets great reviews. IMPORTANT NOTE: If this is something that's at the top of your list to do in London, you can visit Buckingham Palace before Westminster Abbey. However, the Changing of the Guard will take up most of your morning and then you will be dealing with long lines and crowds at Westminster Abbey. In our opinion, your time is better spent at Westminster Abbey than joining the crowds at the Changing of the Guard. During the months of August and September, and select times during the rest of the year, you can tour the State Rooms of Buckingham Palace. Learn more here. Lunch Next we will be walking over to Whitehall. Restaurants on Whitehall either mediocre or expensive (your best bet on Whitehall is The Red Lion). There are numerous restaurants to try just south of Buckingham Palace, including Bon Gusto (Italian), Quilon (Indian and Asian), or Buckingham Arms (bar/pub located on at 62 Petty France). Churchill War Rooms After lunch, walk to the Churchill War Rooms. This museum has two parts to it. At the Churchill Museum you learn about the life and legacy of Winston Churchill. Then you enter the Cabinet War Rooms. This is the underground bunker where Churchill and his staff ran their operations during World War II. This museum is fascinating and you do not need to be a history buff to appreciate this visit. If you want to learn more about Winston Churchill before your visit to London, consider watching the movie Darkest Hour or reading the book The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, Defiance During the Blitz by Erik Larson. It is about Winston Churchill's first year as prime minister during the bombings by Hitler. This story is told by using the journals from Churchill's inner circle and it provides a fascinating insight on the mind of Churchill and what it was like to live through this time period. To skip the line, purchase your fast track tickets online in advance.

Visit the official website for hours of operation and ticket prices if a visit here interests you (included on the London Pass). Covent Garden Covent Garden is a district in the West End that is now a popular shopping and dining area. Spend the rest of the afternoon and evening exploring this neighborhood. There are numerous restaurants in this area, including a cluster of restaurants and shops in Apple Market. Neal's Yard is a colorful alley near Covent Garden. It's worth the quick visit just to take a photo. Just around the corner is Neal's Yard Dairy, one of the best spots in the city to sample artisanal cheese.

This is absolutely a must-visit destination in London. This was our favorite history lesson in London, plus the crown jewels are stunning, and probably the best in all of Europe. There are several parts to a visit to the Tower of London, so expect to spend approximately 2 hours here. The one-hour Yeoman Warder tour is not only educational but also entertaining (even for kids!). It's a fascinating lesson about the history of London and the events that occurred at the Tower of London. The Crown Jewels, an astonishing display of diamond studded crowns and scepters, are the most amazing in Europe. Now they sit on display for all of us common folk to see. You can also explore the tower walls and tour the White Tower and visit its museum with exhibits containing executioner's blocks and the Royal Armory. Ceremony of the Keys: This is a ceremony where the Tower of London is locked up at the end of the day. Tickets must be reserved online in advance and they can sometimes sell out a year in advance.

By making this the first activity of the day, you can avoid the crowds. Plan on arriving here at opening time. To skip the lines at the Crown Jewels, go here first and then take the Yeoman Warder tour. Another option is this highly rated tour, which begins with the Opening Ceremony of the Tower of London by the Beefeaters, followed by a visit to the Crown Jewels and ends with skip-the-line access to the Tower Bridge Experience.

This is The Shard, one of London's newest editions to its skyline. At the View from The Shard, you will have the highest view over London. It's pricey, but it may be worth it on a day with clear weather.

Visit the official website for more information. Lunch at Borough Market From The Shard, walk a few blocks to Borough Market. The food options are endless at this market.

For the performance schedule and details about visiting the Globe Theatre, visit their website. Tate Modern Sitting next door to the Globe Theatre is Tate Modern, a museum that is home to modern art. This is a place that most people seem to either love or hate. Either you will think the art is rubbish or you'll think that it's brilliant. We kept our visit quick (about an hour) and were still able to tour most of the museum. The Tate Modern is worth it if you are an art lover, but it is skippable if you are not. Hey, if you don't like it, no biggie. The Tate Modern is free to visit!

There are 330 departments offering things for sale like jewelry, electronics, furniture, clothing, and stationary. There are also 32 restaurants so finding a place for dinner should be easy. Option #2: Afternoon Tea & A Leisurely Afternoon For a quintessential British experience, dine on finger sandwiches, scones, and small cakes at one of many hotels offering afternoon tea. There are many hotels and restaurants that offer afternoon tea. We had afternoon tea at The Dilly, at the Montagu Kitchen & Lounge at Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill, and at the Wellington Lounge at the InterContinental London Park Lane. Each experience was fantastic and of the three, we really don't have a favorite. You can visit each of the websites and pick out the one that looks the most interesting to you, or take a look at the list of afternoon teas in this article. After having tea, go for a stroll in the neighborhood of your choice, or visit one of London's green spaces, such as Hyde Park and Green Park. In the evening, have drinks and dinner at a rooftop bar or restaurant. We recommend 8 at the Londoner (creative cocktails and Japanese cuisine), The Rooftop (great views over Trafalgar Square), and the Aviary Rooftop Restaurant. Aviary Rooftop. In the winter, dine in an igloo. For the remainder of the year, this terrace has outdoor seating without the igloos. With More Time If you have more than five days, here are a few sights you can add to your London itinerary. Kew Gardens This is a beautiful spot to visit.

SANDEMANs offers free walking tours that get rave reviews and those over 18 can take a Liquid History Tour of London. There are also Jack the Ripper tours, street art tours, and foodie tours. The list of walking tours in London is long. Here are a few more options. How to Adjust this London Itinerary with Less Time 2 Day London Itinerary: On day 1 of this itinerary, do the Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour and then take in the view from the London Eye, the Sky Garden, or The Shard. On day 2, spend the morning at Westminster Abbey, midday visit the British Museum, in the afternoon visit the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. End the day in Covent Garden. 3 Day London Itinerary: Do days 1 and 2 of this itinerary. On the afternoon of Day 3 visit the British Museum instead of spending time at The Shard, the Globe Theatre, and Tate Modern. 4 Day London Itinerary: Do days 1, 2, and 3 of this itinerary.

If you follow this London itinerary and plan on visiting everything we list, then purchasing a 3-day London Pass is worth it. In order to make the London Pass worth it on this itinerary, start using the pass on the morning of day 2 at Westminster Abbey. The pass will pay for most of your activities on days 2, 3, and 4. On these three days, if you did everything, your cost would be £203.20. The cost of a 3-day London Pass was £184 when I did this pricing update in January 2025 (a savings of £19.2). It is possible to purchase the London Pass with a discount during certain months of the year. GetYourGuide also has discounted pricing for the London Pass. Another advantage of having the London Pass is that you do not need to order numerous tickets online in advance. Purchasing the London Pass not only saves money but also time. Learn more about the London Pass on their website. I do not recommend adding on the Oyster Card through the London Pass. It is slightly cheaper if you purchase the Oyster Card separately. About the Oyster Card The Oyster Card is a smartcard that you use to pay for transportation in London, including the Tube, trams, buses, and more. Before you travel to London, you can purchase an Oyster Card online and have it shipped to your home. Or, you can buy an Oyster Card at Underground Stations, Gatwick Airport, and Heathrow Airport. There is a one-time non-refundable £5 fee to purchase the card. You will preload the card with money.

There is a daily max which means once you hit the max, you can travel as much as you like in a single day and the amount you pay is capped. For a four day stay in London,£30 on the card is a good place to start. For five days in London, start with£35. You can always add more money as you go (do this in the Underground stations).

London can be an overwhelming city for many travelers, especially those visiting for the first time. We have visited London many times and Laurence used to live here. Based on our personal experiences, we've put together a recommended 6-day London itinerary that will help you see the highlights if you have at least 6 days in London. It includes all the major attractions (e. G., Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, and the National Gallery), but also includes several lesser-known sites and encourages you to explore several of London's diverse neighborhoods including Westminster, Greenwich, Kensington, and Camden. We have personally visited all the sights and attractions in this itinerary and are happy to recommend them for your trip. We suggest using this itinerary as a starting point for planning your 6 days in London, not as a definitive itinerary, and you can edit it to put together your own personal itinerary that reflects your own needs and interests. In addition to the 6 day itinerary, we also provide our tips on how to get around London, maps of each day's suggested attractions, and how to save money during your 6 days in London. Table of Contents: Toggle Planning for 6 Days in London Before we share the day-to-day itinerary, here is some essential planning information on getting to London, getting around London, tips for saving money, how to find accommodation, and further resources for planning and making the most of your 6 days in London. Getting to London London is easy to reach by plane, train, or car. London has six main airports: Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, Southend, and London City, and these airports collectively serve just about every region of the world. If you are arriving from an international location outside Europe, busy Heathrow is likely to be your arrival airport. See this airport guide for getting to and from each of the airports in London. If you are arriving by train, London is well-connected to train routes throughout the UK and Europe with a number of train stations in and around central London. Those arriving from Scotland might want to consider an overnight sleeper train. If you are arriving from continental Europe by train or car, you'll need to travel across the English Channel on EuroStar or take a ferry. Getting around London London is best explored either on foot or by public transportation. Cabs and bike hires are also good options. If you need to book a cab, you can use minicabit to compare prices. I would not recommend driving in London unless you are planning to stay on the outskirts of the city as driving and finding parking in central busy locations can be a nightmare and parking can be expensive. If you are driving to London, I'd park your car when you arrive in the city and then use public transport until you leave. London's has a great public transportation network and most visitors spend at least some time traveling on it. This includes public bus, tram, and rail services (including \"the Tube\") within the city. You can buy individual tickets for each ride, but many visitors get an Oyster Card which allows you to travel on almost all the city's public transit options and can save you time and money.

London is home to some really iconic classic luxury hotels like The Ritz, The Dorchester, Brown's, and The Savoy. But it also has a number of mid-range and budget friendly chains like Holiday Inn Express, Travelodge, Best Western, Premier Inn, Ibis, and Point. A Hotels. If you are spending a full week in London, you can often save money by booking an apartment at a weekly versus daily rate. To find the best rates on hotels in London, we recommend searching on Booking. Com or Hotels. Com as in our experience these two sites tend to have the best prices and widest choice on both hotels and a range of apartments. If you are looking for self-catering apartments or rooms, we recommend checking out Plum Guide. We've tried many of the apartment rental sites, and have usually had the best experiences with Plum Guide. Of course,there are also loads of Airbnb alternative booking sites you can check.

Lord Milner B&B Saving Money on London Attractions It is hard to deny that London is a fairly expensive travel destination and attraction entrance fee costs can really add up. Luckily, there are a number of London discount passes you can purchase which can help you save money if you plan to visit a number of London's museums and attractions. Our favorite is the London Pass which allows free entry into over 60 of London's top attractions, and also comes with a free hop-on, hop-off bus ticket and additional discounts on food, shopping, and tours. We've used the London Pass on a number of visits and have written a full review of the London Pass which you can read to help determine if it is a good fit for your trip. Also be sure to check out all the free attractions in London which include top-notch museums, parks, historic sites, special events, and festivals. Another discount card option is the GoCity London Explorer Pass where you can choose up to 7 attractions you want to visit (out of 50+) where you can get free entry into all these attractions (including Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral, Tower of London). See a full list of possible attractions here. This GoCity London Explorer Pass doesn't work as well with our suggested itinerary but may be more appealing to some, especially families, as it includes more attractions geared to families that are not included on the London Pass. Buying Tickets for London Attractions When you are planning on buying tickets for attractions in London, you have two main options. You can book online in advance, or for some attractions, you can buy tickets in person. For most attractions we would recommend booking online in advance, as this means you can skip the in-person ticket lines. Many attractions also now operate a timed entry system, so turning up on the day might lead to disappointment. Booking online in advance is usually the best option, and it also often results in slightly better value tickets compared to on-the-door prices. You then have the option for most attractions of buying direct, or buying via a third-party site like GetYourGuide, Viator or Tiqets. It is always worth comparing prices across the different options, as well as the cancellation policies. Generally, our preferred option is GetYourGuide because they normally offer a full refund up to 24 hours in advance of your visit to most attractions. The prices are nearly always the same as the official site as well. Of course, you will need to check each attraction's policy and compare, but for peace of mind this policy can be very helpful. Walking Tours in London When visiting a new city, or when we just want to get a bit more local insight into somewhere we've been before, we'll often take a walking tour. These offer a couple of advantages as they help orientate you to a new place plus you can get insider tips from a local on the best places to visit and eat. We've taken a number of walking tours in London, and I did this full day London walking tour on my very first visit to London which covered all the central highlights and includes a visit to the Tower of London, the Changing of the Guard, a short Thames cruise, and a view of all the main sites in Westminster. I did this tour on my very first visit to London and really enjoyed it! Our favorite walking tour company is Take Walks, who are behind the popular Walks of Italy walking tour company. They now offer a number of tours in London, and we can highly recommend them if you are looking for a walking tour in the city. We have taken many of their walking tours in London, including both regular walking tours and food tours. See all their London tours here. You can also find a number of popular London walking tours over on GetYourGuide from Harry Potter walking tours to WW2 related walking tours to Royal London tours to food tours to Jack the Ripper tours.

If you are looking for a private walking tour of London, we recommend checking out the London tours offered by Context Travel. They can personalize private tours, adapt to special needs, and can add a car service if needed.

Below are seven popular London day trip options to consider: Stonehenge - Stonehenge is an ancient and mysterious stone circle and this site is one of the most popular day trips from London.

You can visit a number of boats dating back to Tudor times, museums, and other attractions along the historic dock.

Other Resources for Planning 6 Days in London If you are looking for packing tips, check out our suggested London packing list. If you have less than 6 days in London, we have also written a suggested guide to spending one day in London, two days in London, and three days in London. We also have a post about seeing the best of the city and its royal sites in a one day London walking tour. We have written a ton of content about London based on our experiences, so you can check out our London articles on Finding the Universe and our London articles on this blog for more info and to see where we've been. For additional planning resources, the Visit London and Visit Great Britain websites also offer tons of helpful information for visitors. If your travels are taking you beyond London, you can check out Laurence's suggested 2-week UK itinerary to get you started. A 6 Day London Itinerary: How to Spend 6 Days in London London is one of those cities that has an endlessamount of attractions, museums, shows, and potential things to do. This can be overwhelming for many visitors so we've put together our suggested 6 day itinerary that takes in London's most popular attractions as well as several of London's best neighborhoods. I've also tried to arrange them in a logical order so you spend less time traveling around the city and more time seeing the sights. Use this as a guide and starting point for planning your 6 days in London, not as a definitive itinerary, to put together your own personalized itinerary that reflects your own needs and interests. Be sure to check on admission days and hours for any must-see attractions before you set out as many attractions close for one day per week or may be closed due to a special event or renovation. For all attractions with an admission fee, we've noted there is an entry fee by writing \"(fee)\" next to them. Note that since many people use the London Pass, the attractions that are included on the London Pass are starred (*) denoting that passholders receive free entry so they have \"(fee*)\" next to them. We do our best to provide the most updated information, but things change so you may want to double-check fees and London Pass inclusions before your trip. London Itinerary Day 1 - Westminster On your first full day in London, I'd head to Westminster. Westminster is a great place to start your exploration of London as it is the political, cultural, and geographical center of the city. It is also where you'll find some of London's most iconic and famous buildings. The itinerary starts and stops near Parliament Square but can begin it at any point along the route. The map below shows a suggested walking route with the major Day 1 London itinerary locations noted. Click here or on the map below for a closer look and to see exact locations: City Tour First, you might consider taking a tour to get oriented to the city. If you are the kind of person who likes to get a good overview of a city before striking out on your own, a sightseeing bus tour, bike tour, Thames river cruise, or city walking tour is a great way to get oriented. You have loads of options in terms of companies and London Pass holders have access to a free sightseeing hop-on hop-off bus tour, bike tour, and a Thames cruise which all cover the Westminster area. If this sounds appealing, I'd probably recommend either a walking or bus tour for your first day. If you choose a walking tour, most need to be booked in advance, and you can read about one of the guided walking tours of Westminster we did on my very first trip to London to get an idea of what you can cover on foot in the area. As mentioned earlier in the post, we also often use and can recommend walking company Take Walks. They have a number of London walking tours to get you acquainted with London. Westminster Abbey Westminster Abbey (fee*)is definitely one of the most impressive and historical churches in England. The church (and its Norman predecessor) has been the site of all English and British coronations since William the Conqueror in 1066 as well as the site of over a dozen royal weddings, including Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011. The current church dates from 1245, being built mainly from the 13th century to 16th century, and was mostly built in the Gothic style. The church is a coveted burial spot and includes the tombs of British royals as well as Prime Ministers, famous artists, writers, and scientists, and other famous people from the past 1,000 years! This is a popular place so be sure to leave some time to get in and explore. The included audio guide helps give you a lot of background on the church and points out all the highlights. Guide-led tours are also possible for a small extra fee (currently £5/person), check at arrival or on the Abbey website for tour times. In June 2018, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries opened. The galleries, which are reached by the newly build Weston Tower, house historical exhibit and treasures owned by the Abbey. Admission to the Galleries is currently an extra £5.00 and requires a timed ticket as space is limited. You can buy your tickets online in advance here. St. James's Park For a breath of fresh air, take a walk through St. James's Park en-route to Buckingham Palace. The park is one of eight of the city's Royal Parks and has over 50 acres of green spaces, flower beds, and even a lake that contains some famous resident pelicans. There is a small caféhere and it is a great place to take a short break. Also for those interested in the Guards regiments of the British Army, you can make a stop at The Guards Museum (fee*) which is just across from St. James's Park, next to the Wellington Barracks. Buckingham Palace Buckingham Palace is probably the most famous palace in the UK and it serves as the primary London workplace and residence for the reigning sovereign of the United Kingdom. It was originally built as a private residence by the Duke of Buckingham (hence the name) in the early 18th century, but was later acquired by British royalty and expanded over time. The public can tour Buckingham Palace (fee, book tickets in advance here) but only for about 8 weeks per year (generally August and September). We have done that tour and it is definitely worth it if you have the time and budget. However, you can get a good view of the palace from outside the gates year-round and you can walk up to see the marble and bronze Victoria Memorial that stands in front of the palace at the end of The Mall. Depending on the day of you visit (as well as weather and security conditions), you may get a chance to see the Changing of the King's Guard ceremony at the forecourt of Buckingham Palace which often takes place around 11am. The full ceremony lasts about 45 minutes. If you want to see the Changing of the Guard ceremony, check the schedule online in advance and show up early to get a good viewing spot. If you don't want to stand in the crowds, you can try going to Friary Court in front of St. James Palace for the ceremony (the Old Guard normally lines up and starts here) or watching the Changing The King's Lifeguard (horse guards) at the Horse Guards Parade as both spots attract fewer visitors. Even if you can't visit the State Rooms of Buckingham Place, there are places to visit on the palace grounds year-round. You can visit the Royal Mews (fee, book tickets here) which showcases the royal collection of historic carriages and coaches, including the Diamond Jubilee State Coach. Art lovers will want to stop at the King's Gallery (fee*, book tickets here) which displays regularly changing exhibitions of art from the royal collection. St. James's Palace St James's Palaceis the most senior royal palace in theUnited Kingdom, having been built during the reign of King Henry VIII in the 16th century. Although it is no longer the residence of the monarch, it is the meeting place and London residence of members of the British royal family. The palace is not open to the public but as noted above you can see the start of the Changing of the Guard ceremony from Friary Court in front of the palace. Piccadilly Circus Piccadilly Circusis a famous road junction and a popular public meeting spot in London. The area is famous for its large neon signs and video advertising as well as the Shaftesbury Memorial with its statue of Anteros. The spot is well-located for an easy walk to the West End theaters and Regent Street, one of London's major shopping streets. It's also going to be familiar to Harry Potter fans as it was one of the Harry Potter filming locations in London. Trafalgar Square Trafalgar Square is a popular public square in central London known for its monuments, architecture, street artists, and surrounding museums. The square itself is home to Nelson's Column (a monument commemorating Admiral Horatio Nelson, who died in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805), the famous stone lion statues, and the featured contemporary art on the Fourth Plinth. Around the square you'll also find two of London's top art museums, the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery. Both are highly recommended for art lovers and include works by some of the world's most famous artists from Turner to Monet. Also nearby (hidden underground in St. Martin-in-the-Fields!) you can visit the London Brass RubbingCentre (fee) to learn about and create a brass rubbing to take home. A great activity for families (we had fun too!). Note that this isn't always available, check the website for when you can do it. National Gallery Whitehall & Downing Street Whitehall is the main street running south from Trafalgar Square towardsParliament Square. This area was once home to the Palace of Whitehall, a sprawling royal palace complex and the largest palace in the world until it burned in 1698. However, today visitors can still see one remaining section of the palace complex, the Banqueting Hall (fee) designed by famous architect Inigo Jones with a ceiling painted by Peter Paul Reubens. Today Whitehallis the center of the Government of the United Kingdom and you'll pass a number of buildings home to various departments and ministries, including the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office. Along this street you'll also find The Household Calvary Museum (fee*), located in the 18th century stables of the Horse Guards,which gives information on the history of the Household Cavalry and displays a small collection of uniforms and weapons. Past the Banqueting Hall and Household Cavalry Museum, you'll pass the entrance to Downing Street. The street is gated and guarded, but you can peek through and should be able to see the door to 10 Downing Street, which is the headquarters of the UK government and official residence of the Prime Minister. There are a lot of statues and memorials along the street, including The Cenotaph, which has been designated as the United Kingdom's official national war memorial. As you continue down Whitehall, you'll end in Parliament Square. Parliament Square & Houses of Parliament Parliament Square is a public square where you'll find a number of statues of famous people, including Winston Churchill, David Lloyd George, Abraham Lincoln, and Nelson Mandela. The square is surrounded by famous buildings, including Westminster Abbey and St. Margaret's Church, the parish church of the Palace of Westminster. On one side of the square you'll see the iconic Palace of Westminster, better known as the Houses of Parliament, with the iconic Elizabethan Tower which contains the famous Big Ben bell. The building is named after the former medieval palace that once stood here, and you can actually visit a section of the old palace, the 14th century Jewel Tower (fee*), if you want a sense of what the original Palace of Westminster was like. The public can visit the Houses of Parliament on certain dates, and debates are free for the public to watch. But if you want to actually tour the building, tours are available on certain days of the week and the tours include a number of rooms, including Westminster Hall, St. Stephens Hall, Commons Chamber, and the Lords Chamber. UK residents can contact their local MP or a Member of the House of Lords to request and arrange a free tour. Otherwise, you can book a tour ticket online for a self-guided audio tour or guided tour. The tour here is well worth it if you have the chance to do it during your visit. We did a guided tour plus a Thames-side afternoon tea here and really enjoyed seeing the inside of this iconic building! Westminster Bridge After you have visited all the spots you want to in and around Parliament Square, walk onto Westminster Bridge and look back for a great view of the House of Parliament and the River Thames. You can then take a walk along the Thames or head off to dinner. Tomorrow the itinerary will bring us back to the Thames to further explore more of London's iconic sites. London Itinerary Day 2 - Along the River Thames Today we'd suggest heading back into central London and focusing on sites located along the famous River Thames, London's main river and the longest river in England. The Day 2 itinerary takes you to more of London's most historic and iconic sites and attractions. It starts at the Tower of London and ends either at the Churchill War Rooms or the London Eye, depending on your time, energy, and interests. The first part of the itinerary is walkable but you'll probably want to use the Thames river boat or public transit to get from the bridges to the Churchill War Rooms. If you want to do a Thames river cruise (fee*), this is a good day for it. Click here or on the map below for a closer look and to see exact locations, note that the closest pier to the Churchill War Rooms is Westminster Pier but this map did not allow us to plot that route: Tower of London The Tower of London (fee*) is a UNESCO world heritage site that has served as a fortress, prison, armory, Royal Mint, and place of execution among other uses during its long history. It is famous for serving as a prison and execution site of famous people like Queen Anne Boleyn and for housing the Crown Jewels. There is a lot packed in here and highlights include the Crown Jewels, White Tower, Tower Green, and tours given by the Yeomen Warders (Beefeaters). This is a popular place so we'd strongly recommend trying to get here around opening, head to the Crown Jewels first, and plan to spend at least 2 hours visiting here. One of our favorite attractions in central London but also one of the most crowded so do try to get here early. You can buy a ticket online in advance here. We also recommend checking prices on the official website here, where you can also see opening times. For more on visiting, see our complete guide to the Tower of London. Thames Cruise Today is a good day to do a sightseeing boat cruise of the River Thames, as all the suggested locations today are alongside the river. There is a City Cruises (fee) dock just a short walk from the Tower of London and you can use the cruise to see the city from the Thames and get to the next location with a 24 hour hop on, hop off cruise ticket. Another option is to get a River Roamer pass (fee*) for the Thames Clipper, a commuter boat service, or just buy a single ticket for a one time ride. Of course, you can also just walk to each attraction or take public transit. HMS Belfast Next suggested stop is HMS Belfast (fee), which is permanently moored on the Thames a short walk from Tower Bridge on the south bank. This historic warship, operated today by Imperial War Museums, will definitely be of interest to military buffs, or anyone with an interest in boats. Launched just before the outbreak of World War 2, this Royal Navy Light Cruiser saw action in both World War 2 and the Korean War, before being decommissioned in 1963. Since 1971 she's been a popular London tourist attraction, and you can spend a good deal of time learning all about operational life on board this historic warship. There is a small café next to the visitor entrance to the ship which serves fresh sandwiches, salads, pastries, and coffee if you need a bite to eat. Tower Bridge and London Bridge Next I would take some time to appreciate two of London's most famous bridges, the London Bridge and Tower Bridge. Both bridges have exhibitions you can visit, although in terms of time I would choose to visit only one exhibition or just admire them both from the outside. London Bridge is famous for being the subject of the nursery rhyme\"London Bridge Is Falling Down\" and there has been a London Bridge since Roman times with the current one dating only to the 1970's. The London Bridge Experience (fee*) is an interactive educational and amusement attraction geared towards families with children and young adults that don't mind a bit of a scare. The bridge in London which you are probably more familiar with in terms of photos is Tower Bridge, often mistakenly called London Bridge by tourists. This iconic bridge opened in 1894 and is currently painted white and blue. If you want to learn more about the bridge, then you should visit the Tower Bridge Exhibition (fee*). Here you can learn about the history of the bridge, including how it was built and how the lifting mechanism works to allow ships through. You can also walk the glass floor walkway across the bridge, a 138 feet high walkway that will definitely test any fear of heights you may have! view down from glass walkway of Tower Bridge! Alternatives (or additional spots) in the area to the above attractions: Southwark Cathedral, Borough Market (one of London's most famous food markets), The Old Operating Theatre Museum (fee*), The Monument (fee*), and The View from the Shard (fee*). Churchill War Rooms Now, we are going to head back to Westminster to visit the Churchill War Rooms which are not too far from where you were yesterday. You'll likely want to hop on the Thames boat to Westminster Pier or take public transit here. The Churchill War Rooms (fee) are run by the Imperial War Museums (those with a military history interest will also want to visit the Imperial War Museum in London) and allow the public to visit the huge underground secret bunker where the majority of the war effort during World War 2 was directed from August 1939 to August 1945. The visit essentially includes two places: the Cabinet War Rooms and the Churchill Museum. You get to visit an interesting maze of rooms to see where communications and strategizing happened as well as where people ate, slept, and cooked during WW2. Then a separate large museum room is devoted to the life of Winston Churchill and his legacy. It has the best collection of information and exhibits on Churchill that I have visited, and it covers his life from birth to death, not just the war years. There is an excellent audio guide included with the tour that covers the Cabinet War Rooms, For those with an interest in Churchill, we recommend checking out this article about visiting some of the top Winston Churchill sites. For those with an interest in Churchill and the London Blitz, we can also recommend the London Churchill War Room tour by Context Travel which includes a guided visit to the Churchill War Rooms as well as a guided tour of parts of London related to the Blitz. We love Context Travel tours, which are geared to the intellectually curious travelers, and if you book this tour or any other tour with Context Travel, using the link above you'll receive 10% off any Context Travel tour anywhere in the world. Be sure to book in advance of your trip. London Dungeon If you still have time and energy you might want to continue on across the Westminster Bridge to where you'll find more attractions, including the London Dungeon and the London Eye. The London Dungeon (fee) is an interactive attraction that uses costumed actors, rides, special effects, and staging to tell London's more sinister history while offering up a bit of fun and scares. I wouldn't come here for a history lesson but if you enjoy haunted houses and amusement parks, you'll probably enjoy this. Not recommended for young children. The dungeon also sometimes offers adult-only nights that include food and drinks. Depending on who you are, the London Dungeon is either a must-see or a must-avoid! Next door to the Dungeon are also two family-oriented attractions, the Sea Life London Aquarium and DreamWorks Tours: Shrek's Adventure. London Eye The London Eye (fee*) is Europe's tallest observation wheel and is essentially a giant slow ferris wheel with large, enclosed glass pods. The London Eye is a great place to get some nice views of London, although I'd pass if the weather is terrible. It is open late so makes a great last stop, and around sunset is an ideal time to do the ride if the weather is pleasant. You can save money (and time) by purchasing your tickets in advance. Online prices are usually much lower than if you buy at the ticket desk. You can buy tickets for the London Eye from the official site here. We also have a complete guide to visiting the London Eye here. Alternatively, if you didn't do a boat trip on the Thames already, you might consider booking an evening sunset and/or dinner Thames river cruise. There are several companies that offer these in London, including City Cruises mentioned earlier and Bateaux London. London Itinerary Day 3 - More London Highlights Today we are going to explore even more of London's central highlights, including the British Museum, Covent Garden, St. Paul's Cathedral, and Shakespeare's Globe. Today all of the attractions are within walking distance but you may want to use public transit to reach some of them. It may also be a good day to use a hop-on hop-off bus if you have a free ticket with the London Pass as the bus routes go to or near all the attractions on today's route. Click here or on the map below for a closer look: British Museum The British Museum is a museum holding a vast collection of artifacts from cultures around the world, ancient to modern. Established in 1753 with the collection of just one man, it has grown to be one of the largest and most comprehensive collections in the world with about 8 million objects in its permanent collection! If you are going to only visit one general museum in London, this would probably be my recommendation as it holds a wealth of treasures from mummies to vases, with the Rosetta Stone, Parthenon sculptures, and Lewis Chessmen being some of its most well-known treasures. Now you can walk (about 15 minutes) or jump on public transportation to get to Covent Garden and the London Transport Museum. Lewis Chessmen London Transport Museum The London Transport Museum (fee*) is a museum dedicated to telling the story of London's transport system over the last 200 years, highlighting the link between transport and the growth of modern London culture and society. The museum collection is housed in a 19th century building that was previously used for the Covent Garden Flower Market. As a visitor you can follow a self-guided path that begins with what transportation was like around 1800 in London and then continues to the present day. So you get to see everything from human carried sedan chairs to horse-drawn omnibuses to steam trains to the famous red double-decker buses. The museum does a good job of having a mix of information and interactive exhibits. Covent Garden Covent Garden is a popular tourist destination in London. It originally was a food market (mainly fruit and vegetables) and by the 18th century had become a bit seedy and was also a popular red-light district. The food market eventually outgrew the space and was moved in the 1970's and today the area is home to shops, cafes, pubs, two markets selling crafts, jewelry, souvenirs, and goods. It is a popular spot for street entertainers, and you'll often find crowds of people gathered around an entertainer here. The area has long served as an area of entertainment and the first known Punch and Judy like puppet show in England was performed here in 1662! An easy area to find a bite to eat if you are hungry as there are dozens of bars and restaurants here. Now you can walk on to St. Paul's Cathedral (20-25 minutes) or take public transit. St Paul's Cathedral St Paul's Cathedral (fee*) is an Anglican church designed by Sir Christopher Wren in the English Baroque style. The present church was consecrated in 1697; however, it sits on the same site as the former medieval church of the same name which was badly damaged by fire. Today it is the seat of the Bishop of London and one of the most important churches in London. The Cathedral was the tallest building in London for almost 200 years, and although no longer the tallest it can still be seen from many places in London and is one of the most recognizable places on the city skyline. The Cathedral has been the site of many famous services and events, including the state funerals of Lord Nelson and Winston Churchill, jubilee celebrations for both Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II, and royal weddings such as that of Prince Charles to Princess Diana. St. Paul's Cathedral was a symbol of resilience during WW2 as images of the recognizable Dome still standing after the Blitz gave hope to people (although the church was damaged), and Churchill would give orders to try to protect the church at all costs. Services were held here after both WW1 and WW2 to give thanks for their end and to pray for peace. Admission prices include an audioguide for self-guided visits or you can join a regular guided tour of the church. St. Paul's Cathedral is a busy tourist attraction so be sure to allot enough time, especially if you want to climb the steps to the dome which can have a long line. If you are planning to visit without a London Pass, especially in the summer months, we recommend booking your ticket online in advance to save money on admission and to get skip the line access. Worshippers attending a church service or wanting to pray in one of the side chapels can enter for free. An Alternative or additional stop in the area may be the Museum of London, which is a great free museum dedicated to the history of London. Tate Modern Now you can cross the Millennium Bridge, a popular pedestrian bridge, to reach the Tate Modern,the largest international modern art gallery in the UK. The museum's location is unusual as it is based in a former power station building. The museum displaysboth a permanent collection as well as several temporary exhibitions throughout the year. Personally I prefer the Tate Britain (also in London) since I tend to like older art, but this is a must-see for modern and contemporary art lovers and has some great masterpieces. The museum is free to visit. Shakespeare's Globe A short walk away you'll come to a famous white theater building. First let me say that the current Shakespeare's Globe theater (fee*) is not the original and in fact this one only dates to 1997! The original Globe Theatre was built in 1599, destroyed by fire in 1613, rebuilt in 1614, and then demolished in 1644. The current one is a realistic reconstruction of the original (with concessions to modern health and safety requirements) and is located very close to the site of the original. The man behind the rebuilding of the Globe is the late American actor and director Sam Wanamaker, who sadly died before the Globe was completed. The complex also has a museum exhibition about Shakespeare's work and the original theater, a smaller candle-lit indoor theatre called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, and an educational and rehearsal space. Today the public can visit the exhibition and take a guided tour of the theater, which allows visitors to experience what it would have been like to go to a theater in the Elizabethan era as either a lord or lady or as a poor groundling. You can also get tickets for performances at both the Globe (summer only) and the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse (year-round). Enjoy a West End Show or Hit a Club Tonight is a perfect evening to go see a West End Show performance, a performance in Shakespeare's Globe, or other theater or concert event. London is full of nightlife throughout the year--concerts, shows, theater, opera, circuses, comedy shows--so you shouldn't have a problem finding something that will appeal. If you are planning to go to a theater performance, you can book tickets in advance online before your trip (recommended if there is a performance you really want to see) or try to find a deal once you are in the city. Here are some tips for buying London theatre tickets. Note that London Pass users typically have access to theater ticket discounts on certain West End shows. Also check out what is happening at the Royal Albert Hall during your visit, this world-famous venue hosts everything from classical concerts to rock bands to tennis matches! If you prefer a club or a bar to a theater, London has some of the best clubs in Europe. Here is a list of some of London's top clubs to get you started. Note that most bars stop serving drinks between 11am and 2am, and here is a guide to some of London's late night bars. London Itinerary Day 4 - Day excursion & Camden If you have 6 days in London, I would head out of central London for at least one day. Today I'd recommend visiting one of the major attractions outside the city in the morning and then spending the afternoon in the borough of Camden. Camden is well-known for its markets, canals, zoo, and Regent's Park. Alternatively, if you are not interested in visiting Camden, you could try visiting two of the recommended morning attractions (e. G., Windsor Castle and Kew Gardens). You'll need to use public transit to reach the morning attractions and to get to Camden but the attractions in Camden are all within walking distance. Click here or on the maps (you'll need to zoom in to see the Camden sites) below for a closer look: Visit an Out of Central London Attraction In the morning I'd recommend heading to one attraction on the outskirts of London or just outside the city. All of these are popular and busy attractions so getting there around opening time is wise idea! Here are our top recommendations to choose from: Option 1: Windsor Castle Windsor Castle (fee*) was built as a defensive fortification by William the Conqueror in the 11th century. Today it is the largest and longest continuously occupied royal residence in the world. Much of the castle's magnificent State Rooms were designed and built in the 19th century, and the castle is a common weekend home for King Charles III. Highlights here include the State Apartments, Queen Mary's Dolls' House, and the 15th-centurySt. George's Chapel. You can also see the Changing of the Guards ceremony here on certain days which is a similar but much smaller version of the ceremony that takes place in front of Buckingham Palace. There is an excellent audioguide included with admission and you can also join offered guided tours at the castle. Note that the castle can get very busy, especially in the summer, so try to arrive at opening time or alternatively you may want to visit in the afternoon. To get here you need to take a train out of London. You cannot use an Oyster Card and will need to buy a rail ticket, which you can do here. Windsor Castle tickets can also be purchased here. Windsor Castle Option 2: Hampton Court Palace Hampton Court Palace (fee*) is a former royal palace, originally built in the 16th century for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, a powerful person during the time of King Henry VIII. However, Wolsey would fall out of favor with the king (as most people did) and Henry would confiscate his house and use it as his own palace. The huge Tudor and Baroque style royal palace was used by British monarchs until the 18th century and is now a popular tourist destination. The palace is huge and you could spend all day exploring its many rooms, but luckily the self-guided tours are broken up by themes so you can decide which parts of the palace are of most interest to you. The gardens, the tennis court, and hedge maze are also definitely worth exploring here. This is a must-see for anyone interested in King Henry VIII and Tudor history. The palace is located in outer London and can be reached by public transportation. Tickets can be bought in advance here. Option 3: Kew Gardens Kew Gardens (fee*) is considered one of the best botanical gardens in the world, housing over 8 million specimens. The gardens have \"the largest and most diverse botanical and mycological collections in the world\", representing \"over 95% of known flowering plant genera and more than 60% of known fungal genera\"! Some highlights include the Palm House, Temperate House, Waterlily House, and Treetop walkway. A trip here offers more than just plants, as you can also visit art galleries, the Great Pagoda, and tour Kew Palace, a former royal residence located within the gardens. You can explore at your own pace or join one of the garden's guided walk tours that come free with entry. This is a must-see for any garden lover. Kew Gardens are located in outer London and can be reached by public transportation. Tickets can be bought in advance here. Kew Gardens Option 4: Warner Brothers Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter If you are a Harry Potter fan you might want to consider spending the morning at the Warner Brothers Studio located just outside the city. This film studio was where all eight of the Harry Potter films were actually filmed, and they have retained many of the original sets, clothing, and props from the movies. On the largely self-guided The Making of Harry Potter tour (fee), you can visit the Great Hall, the railway station, numerous filming locations from inside Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest, and Diagon Alley. You'll learn many of the secrets of how the films were made, have the opportunity to drink Butterbeer, and explore giant gift shops full of all things Harry Potter. Many people take 3.5 to 4 hours to visit here. So you'll want to take this into account in planning your day as well as the time it will take you get there. This will be a full day trip for some. T o get to the Studio, you can take a National Rail train (London Euston most convenient) to the Watford Junction station and then you can take the studio tour shuttle from the station to the film studios. The shuttle is included with your Studio Tour ticket. You must book your tickets in advance online and have the voucher with you on your visit. You can also book a tour from central London that will take you directly to and from the studio so you don't have to take the train and shuttle. Check out our detailed guide to the Harry Potter Studio Tour for more information, tips, and photos. Diagon Alley Explore Camden After a morning spent exploring a royal palace, marveling at Hogwarts' Great Hall, or wandering around one of the world's best botanical gardens, you might want to head to the borough of Camden. Camden is a diverse neighborhood that has been home to a number of famous people over the centuries from Charles Dickens to Sigmund Freud to Amy Winehouse. Once an industrial area known for shipping gin, it is now known for its markets, music scene, street art, and alternative fashion stores. It is also home to Regent's Park and the London Zoo, and Camden Lock is a popular place to start a canal boat ride along the Regent's Canal. View of Regent's Canal from Camden Lock Market Camden Market Camden Market is not a single market, but consists of several different markets within walking distance of each other. Market stalls sell just about everything including food, clothing, crafts, art, souvenirs, and more. In addition to the market stalls, you'll also find restaurants, bars, dance clubs, and other entertainment spaces here. It is a popular tourist destination as well as a meet-up spot for Londoners. Although the Camden Market is open daily, you'll find it at its busiest and with the most open stalls on the weekends. Great place to find something to eat. London Zoo The ZSL London Zoo (fee*) is the world's oldest scientific zoo and it was originally begun with a royal collection of animals that has been previously kept at the Tower of London. Today the zoo animals include lions, hippos, otters, gorillas, tigers, and giraffes. The newest exhibition is the Land of Lions which features a large interactive exhibit for its endangered Asiatic lions. The London Zoo also has a Reptile House, an aquarium, an aviary, and a large collection of insects. There are several places to eat, shop, and you can even take a photography workshop or spend the night in the zoo. The Regent's Park The Regent's Park is a large 410 acre royal park that is mainly open parkland. In the northern end you'll find the London Zoo, but you'll also find lots of open spaces, gardens, sporting pitches and facilities, children's playgrounds, sculptures, memorials, and an open air theater. You can also rent a boat to row across its lake (seasonal), climb Primrose Hill for a nice view of London, or enjoy the roses at Queen Mary Gardens. There are also homes located in Regent's Park, including Winfeld House, which has been the official residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the UK since after World War 2. A great place to have a break or enjoy a picnic (there is a restaurant located in the center of the park or bring your own food). Madame Tussauds If you still have time and energy, you can cross Regent's Park's (by foot or bus) and you can visit Madame Tussauds. Madame Tussauds (fee*) is a museum displaying the waxworks of famous and historic people from Tudor royalty to current Hollywood film stars. The museum was started by an interesting French woman Marie Tussaud who traveled around Europe with her wax figure collection until opening a permanent location in 1835. Although many of the original figures have been destroyed or damaged by fire or bombing, some of Tussaud's original figures still exist as well as older ones she inherited. The oldest existing figure displayed in the collection is one modeled after Madame du Barry dating from 1765, but the museum also includes everyone from Queen Elizabeth II to the band One Direction to Angelina Jolie. Although not for everyone, it is a popular place to take a selfie with your favorite stars. The museum has become a popular London attraction and there are now branches of Madame Tussauds around the world, but if you are only going to visit one, I'd visit the original! See our guide to visiting Madame Tussauds for more information. Alternative places you may want to visit in the area include the Sherlock Holmes Museum (fee) andthe Jewish Museum (fee). Note that if you are a fan of Amy Winehouse, you'll find a Amy Winehouse statue near the Stables Market, street art dedicated to her memory throughout the area, and there was an exhibition at the Jewish Museum about her life and career when we last visited. Amy Winehouse street art London Itinerary Day 5 - Kensington Today I'd suggest exploring the London borough of Kensington & Chelsea, with a particular focus on South Kensington. This affluent area of the city is full of museums, galleries, stores, and world-class entertainment venues. Everything on the main itinerary is within walking distance (or a short public transit ride if you prefer). Click here or on map below for location details: Kensington Palace Kensington Palace (fee*) is a royal residence set inKensington Gardens. It began as a fairly humble 17th century two-storeyJacobeanmansion and was expanded by the royal family into the giant royal residence it is today. The palace might be best associated with Queen Victoria as it was here that she spent much of her unhappy childhood and first learned that she was queen. More recently it was the official residence of Prince Charles (prior to his becoming King), Princess Diana, and their two sons. Today it is still an official private residence and workplace for many royals including Prince William and Prince Harry, but the State Rooms are open to the public. There is a lot to see here and it can be a bit confusing to try to wander around on your own, but luckily the palace has put together several different self-guided routes based on different themes and people (e. G., King's Apartments, Queen Victoria, royal fashion) to help you get the most of your visit. There is a cafe here and the garden is a nice place to enjoy a cup of tea if the weather is pleasant. This palace can be very busy, especially in the summer months or when they have a popular exhibition. If you don't have a London Pass I would recommend booking your ticket in advance here and if you do have a London Pass, I'd recommend arriving near opening time. Kensington Gardens After visiting Kensnigton Palace, if the weather is nice, I'd spend some time exploring Kensington Gardens and adjacent Hyde Park. Within this large green space, you'll find a number of gardens, sporting area, statues, biking trails, and boat rentals (seasonal). Some of the notable places to see or visit include the Serpentine Gallery, Serpentine Sackler Gallery, the Princess Diana Memorial, Peter Pan statue, the Elfin Oak, and the ornate Albert Memorial. An easy place to spend an hour or two. Royal Albert Hall The Royal Albert Hall is a world-class performance venue that was opened in 1871 by Queen Victoria. The hall has hosted just about every kind of event which have included concerts by Richard Wagner, wartime speeches by Winston Churchill, rock concerts by the Beatles, tennis tournaments,Cirque du Soleil performances,and Star Wars films accompanied by a live symphony orchestra. It has been host to the BBC Proms for decades. If you are interested in going inside, you can take a guided tour of the Royal Albert Hall (fee*). Guided tours include the original carriage entrance, the auditorium, gallery, royal private box, and the private suites of the royal family. If you'd rather come for a performance, you can head inside to the Ticket Office. Note if you are on a small budget, inexpensive standing room only tickets are available for some performances, including the BBC Proms. Kensington Museums It's museum time! Kensington is one of our favorite areas for museums as it has loads of them, and the best part is that almost all of them are free to visit! Let's talk about the three main museums, and you can choose your favorite or dive into all three. First you have The Science Museum which has information and exhibits on a range of scientific topics from genetics and electricity to space travel and virtual reality. There are loads of interactive exhibits that are both fun and educational. The museum also has an IMAX theater (fee*). Next you have the Natural History Museum and its giant life and earth science specimens are housed in a beautiful building that looks more like a cathedral than a museum. Its collection holds over 80 million items and you can see everything from dinosaur skeletons to specimens collected by Charles Darwin to a giant mineral collection. There is also a seasonal butterfly house (fee) at the museum. The Victoria & Albert Museum, often referred to as the V&A Museum, is the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design, with over 2 million objects in its collection that spans 5,000 years of human history! You'll find everything from Greek pillars to Chinese vases to Alexander McQueen gowns here. The museum is also known for hosting popular temporary exhibitions (fee) throughout the year. Shopping Kensington is well-known as a shopping destination with many of its most famous stores located along Kensington High Street, Brompton Road, King's Road, and Sloane Street. Among the hundreds of stores, you'll find popular antique stores, the British department store Harvey Nichols, and the world-famous Harrods with its 1 million square feet of retail space which sells everything from specialty food to designer shoes! Harrods was started by Charles Henry Harrods as a small family-run shop, but like many British landmark institutions it is sadly now owned by foreign corporations (in this case the state of Qatar). In addition to shopping, you might also want to stop for an afternoon tea, such as this fashion inspired afternoon tea in Knightsbridge. If you prefer a market, the Portobello Road Market in Chelsea is a popular market and at its best on Saturdays. There are many cafes and restaurants in this area if you are here at dinner time. Alternatives: There are many other things to see in the area (mostly in Chelsea), including the Chelsea Physic Garden (fee*), Leighton House Museum (fee), Design Museum (fee*), Portobello Road Market, Chelsea Football Club Stadium Tour & Museum (fee*), and the recently renovated National Army Museum (fee*). London Itinerary Day 6 - Greenwich or Free Day For your final day in London, consider spending the day in the London borough of Greenwich. Greenwich is world-famous as the traditional location of thePrime Meridian and for its observatory, but it also has a number of historical buildings, museums, a market, a giant park, and a famous tea clipper. A large portion of Greenwich, and most of today's suggested itinerary, is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as Maritime Greenwich. Or alternatively leave this day free to wander around London's streets and parks, do some shopping, or catch up on places you missed on prior days. Maybe you want to simply spend a day relaxing by the Thames, exploring the latest art exhibits, buying gifts for loved ones back home, or checking out vintage clothing shops. This is also a perfect day to follow your specific interests and passions, whether it is searching for Harry Potter in London, checking out London's best pubs, visiting Winston Churchill sites, taking a Jack the Ripper tour, checking off London's World Heritage sites, exploring London's street art, or finding the perfect fish & chips shop. Click here or on map below for Greenwich location details: Cutty Sark The Cutty Sark (fee*) is a British clipper ship built in Scotland on the River Clyde in 1869. The ship is historically significant for being one of the last tea clipper ships ever built and one of the last clipper ships of this period still in existence. The ship was originally used to carry tea from China to England as quickly as possible and would visit almost every major world port during its life at sea. In later years as steam-powered ships became popular, the Cutty Sark was used for cargo transport and then as a training ship. It was dry docked here in 1954 and is now one of the area's most popular tourist attractions. A tour of the Cutty Sark allows you to see the ship's interior, learn about the ship's history and what it was like at sea in Victorian times, hear stories of the people on board the ship, and see the ship's hull up close as you walk underneath it. There is also a cafe on board where you can grab sandwiches or have afternoon tea (if you want a full afternoon tea, book it in advance). Tickets can be purchased in advance here. Old Royal Naval College The Old Royal Naval College is a set of buildings designed by Christopher Wren whose original purpose was to serve as a place to care for and house retired seamen. Later the large building complex was used as a naval training college and today is used for a number of functions, and many of the buildings are open to the public. We'd recommend starting your visit at the Greenwich Visitor Centre which has some helpful information, displays, and artifacts. Then you can wander around the site to admire the buildings, and you can visit the Chapel and the beautiful Painted Hall, painted by James Thornhillin the early 18th century. Guided tours can also sometimes be arranged for those with a special interest to see more areas of the complex not usually open to the public. Before the Old Royal Naval College was built, the Palace of Placentia (better known as Greenwich Palace) sat here which was the birthplace of King Henry VIII and his daughters and later queens Mary I and Elizabeth I. You can learn more about it in the Greenwich Visitor Centre. National Maritime Museum The National Maritime Museum is a great museum dedicated to the dramatic maritime history of Britain. The museum covers about everything related to the sea from shipping and trading, fishing, technology development, the Atlantic Slave trade, pirates and explorers, war battles at sea, leisure cruises, and the life of seamen throughout the ages. You'll even find J.M.W. Turners' largest painting The Battle of Trafalgar here. The museum is packed with information, exhibits, and fun interactive bits. The museum is free to visit. Not far away you can also visit the Queen's House, a beautiful and architecturally significant former royal residence designed by Inigo Jones. Admiral Nelson's Trafalgar coat Greenwich Park Greenwich Park is yet another of the large royal parks in London that was once a royal hunting park. Here in its 183 green acres,you'll find a number of attractions, historical ruins, memorials, sporting fields, a deer park, and gardens. Our favorites are the rose garden, the Ranger's House which houses the Wernher Collection of art, and the Royal Observatory Greenwich. Note that the hill in the park is a bit steep but those who climb the hill are also rewarded by a nice view of London. Greenwich Park Royal Observatory Greenwich The Royal Observatory Greenwich (fee*) is a well-known observatory that has played a significant role in the history of astronomy and navigation. It is known as the location of the prime meridian and gave its name to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and sits first on the meridian line. The observatory is now maintained as a museum and visitors can learn about the history and discoveries at the observatory, stand on the famous Meridian line, visit Flamsteed House, see a camera obscura, and see the great equatorial telescope. Admission includes an audioguide to make the most of your self-guided visit. You can buy your tickets in advance here. Nearby is the interactive Astronomy Centre (free to visit) and the attached Peter Harrison Planetarium (fee), which is currently London's only planetarium. Greenwich Market Greenwich Market has been in existence since the 18th century and is one of London's best covered markets. The market sells food, clothing, flowers, antiques, crafts, souvenirs, art, and more. There are also a number of pubs and restaurants nearby. A great area to grab a snack or meal. Isle of Dogs If you are looking for a walk underneath the River Thames, you can take a walk across the Greenwich Foot Tunnel to the Isle of Dogs. The Isle of Dogs is surrounded by the Thames on three sides and while once na industrial dock area, it is mainly a residential area now. The view from the Island Gardens across the river of the Queen's House and Greenwich Hospital was depicted by Canaletto in a few of his paintings. From here you can walk back across the tunnel to Greenwich or take public transit onto your destination. Note that if you haven't done a Thames cruise yet and still want to, you can pick up a boat at the Greenwich Pier near the Greenwich foot tunnel entrance. Final Night Out? If you haven't already taken in a West End Show or gone out for some of London's nightlife, this is your last chance to do it. If you are looking for an earlier evening (big flight tomorrow?), consider splurging on a nice dinner to enjoy your final evening in London and talk about all the great things you saw and did during your 6 days in London! Save Money on your 6 Days in London Trip with the London Pass We wanted to give you an example of the cost savings over 6 days in London if you have a London Pass. The following is based on the above itinerary although it doesn't include every single attraction we suggested but includes what we believe is a realistic number for someone planning to actively sightsee based on the above itinerary. Note, we have included images of the London Pass which was previously available as a physical product. As of 2021, the pass is only available as virtual product, which can be used through a smartphone app. The code can also be printed out for scanning. Here is the cost savings for 6 days in London for 2 people with the London Pass based on our itinerary above: London Pass Savings Calculations Attractions Normal Entry Cost (July 2024 Prices) HOHO Sightseeing Bus £37 X 2 = £74 Westminster Abbey £29 X 2 = £58 HOHO Thames Boat £24.6 X 2 = £49.2 Tower of London £34.8 X 2 = £69.6 St Paul's Cathedral £25 X 2 = £50 Shakespeare's Globe Theatre £27 X 2 = £54 London Eye £45 x 2 = £90 Kensington Palace £24 X 2 = £48 Guards Museum £8 X 2 = £16 Household Cavalry Museum £10 x 2 = £20 Jewel Tower £9.5 X 2 = £19 Tower Bridge Exhibition £13.4 X 2 = £26.8 London Transport Museum £24.5 X 2 = £49 Windsor Castle £33 X 2 = £66 ZSL London Zoo £41.8 X 2 = £83.6 Canal Boat Ride £18 X 2 = £36 Science Museum IMAX film £12 X 2 = £24 Royal Albert Hall £17.5 X 2 = £35 Cutty Sark £20 X 2 = £40 Royal Observatory Greenwich £20 X 2 = £40 Total Cost Without Pass for Two Adults £1022.2 Total Cost of two 6 day passes £478 Total Savings with Passes £544.2 It's also always worth comparing prices between the official site here and GetYourGuide here as sometimes one will be better value than the other. As you can see in our example (with the 6 day pass) we ended up with a savings of £272.1 per person for a total cost savings of £544.2. This is definitely a considerable amount for six days of sightseeing! Even if we had visited significantly fewer sites during the six days in London, we would have still saved money with the London Pass. A general rule is that you need to visit an average of 2 to 3 attractions per day to save money with a 6 day London Pass. We highly recommend that all visitors check out the London Pass, especially if it is your first visit to London. It covers free entry to over 80 attractions and museums, plus a number of discounts on tours, restaurants, souvenirs, and theater tickets. Not only will it save many visitors money, it also saves times by providing fast track entry into certain busy sites. However it is not a great fit for everyone, and if you are not sure if it is a good fit or not, read our full review of the London Pass to help you decide as it breaks down the features, ways to purchase, how to calculate your cost savings, and more.

The Big Smoke. It's a sprawling city, covering over 600 square miles and home to almost nine million people. It's also one of the most popular destinations in the world. While referred to in the singular, London is actually a collection of cities. The City of London (aka \"The City\") is just 1.1 square miles (and the site of old Roman settlement Londinium). What we think of as London today is actually other cities (Westminster, Camden, etc.) that \"The City\" gobbled up over the years. (Fun fact: The West and East Ends of London are so named because they were outside the ancient wall that enclosed London.) My like for London turned into love on a visit several years ago. Maybe it was the beautiful weather that stood in stark contrast to my other visits, maybe it was the people who I suddenly felt bonded with, maybe it was all the good restaurants and bars I found. Maybe it just took a decade of visits for the city to just \"click\" with me. Maybe it was all of it. I don't know. But now it's one of my favorite cities in the world. With so much to see and do, planning a trip to London can be overwhelming. Where should you stay? How should you plan your days? What day trips are worth doing? To help you make the most of your visit, have fun, and save money, here is my detailed itinerary for visiting London. London Itinerary Day 1: Walking tour, Parks, Soho, & more! Day 2: British Museum, National Gallery, & more! Day 3: Buckingham Palace, War Rooms, & more! Day 4: Natural History Museum, Jack the Ripper tour, & more! Day 5: Art galleries, Tower of London, & more! Day 6 & 7: Bath, Oxford, Stonehenge, & more! What to See and Do in London: Day 1 Take a Free Walking Tour Start your first day off with a free walking tour to orient yourself and learn about the history of London. They are the best way to get situated on arrival and get some tips from a local guide (you can ask the guide for suggestions about what to see and where to eat during your visit). New Europe and Tours By Foot both offer tours that can show you the highlights and help you get your bearings. Just remember to tip your guide at the end! If you'd prefer a more detailed and in-depth tour, check out Walks. They offer all kinds of cool tours around the city, including an early-access guided tour of the crown jewels. I always take a Walks tour when I visit. They're that good. For more walking tour suggestions, here's a list of the best walking tour companies in London. Explore New Neighborhoods London is a great city to explore on foot. You can follow the ancient Roman wall (part of the wall still exists and so does an old Roman amphitheater, which was rediscovered in the 1980s) from the Tower of London through the center of the city. The city maintains a series of panels about the wall and the history of the city along the way. Visit London has a free app that lets you create personalized maps and itineraries that you can use offline as well. For in-depth paid tours that take you around specific neighborhoods, check out tour marketplace Get Your Guide. It's where local operators can list their tours, so there are a ton of different tours for all interests and budgets, including a street art walking tour around East London and a Harry Potter tour around central London. Relax in a Park After all that walking on the first day, chill out in any one of the city's many parks. Some of my favorites include: St. James' Park (Westminster) Green Park (Westminster/Central London) Regent's Park (Camden Town) Kensington Gardens (Kensington) Hyde Park (Central London) Holland Park (Holland Park) Battersea Park (Battersea) I like to pack up some food, bring a book, and just relax and watch the world go by. It's what the locals do -- and you should too! Hang in Soho I love Soho. It has cute little parks, world-class restaurants, lots of popular bars, funky bookstores, beautiful buildings, and everything in between. I recommend you spend your evening (or many evenings) here eating and drinking and hanging out with the locals. Some recommended places include: Ceviche Soho - Great Peruvian food. 17 Frith Street. Flat Iron - Simple menu featuring steak and salad and a daily special. 17 Beak Street. La Bodega Negra - Amazing Mexican food. 16 Moor Street. Eat Tokyo - Delicious ramen. 16 Old Compton Street. Mr. Foggs - The best gin London can offer! Several differently themed locations. The Three Greyhounds - A fun traditional pub. Fun story: I ended up drinking with Rami Malek from Mr. Robot! He was nice. 25 Greek Street. What to See and Do in London: Day 2 Museum Hop Take advantage of London's incredible museums and overload on history, art, weird oddities, and everything in between. Some of them are so big you can barely see them in a week, let alone a day. Here are some of the best ones to start with: British Museum - By far one of the best museums in all of Europe, this giant museum houses one of the most comprehensive art, cultural, and historical collections in the world. Be sure to budget at least three hours to get a good sense of the museum, though you could easily spend a whole day there. Great Russell St, +44 20 7323 8299, britishmuseum.org. Open daily 10am-5pm (8:30pm on Fridays). Admission is free but they recommend booking tickets in advance.

What to See and Do in London: Day 3 Visit Buckingham Palace Start off with a stroll through Hyde Park's lush and expansive grounds, with its picturesque walkways, ponds, and ducks, before heading to Buckingham Palace, the royal residence and administrative headquarters of the monarchy, to watch the changing of the guard at 10:45am. It lasts for about 45 minutes (arrive early to get the best view). Be sure to check the website first though as the changing of the guards doesn't happen daily (it's usually every other day). If you're visiting during the summer, Buckingham Palace is open to the public. Booking online in advance is recommended. Tickets cost 32 GBP if you book in advance and 35 GBP on the day. You'll be able to explore the lavish State Rooms and see some of the crown's treasures. Expect to spend a couple of hours. Note that the State Rooms are only open for 10 weeks each summer (July 13th to September 25th in 2024). Book your tickets to the State Rooms in advance here. See the Churchill War Rooms Next, meander over to the Churchill War Rooms. Located beneath the Treasury Building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, this includes the government's command center during World War II and a museum about the life of Winston Churchill, who served as Prime Minister of the UK from 1940-1945 and again from 1951-1955. The centerpiece of the whole place is an interactive table that enables visitors to access digitized material from the Churchill archives. It is one of the best museums in London. Book online in advance to avoid the multi-hour wait! Admission is 32 GBP. Open daily 9:30am-6pm. Tour Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament Afterward, marvel at Westminster Abbey and Parliament. You can see the tombs of 17 monarchs dating back to Henry III (who died in 1272) in the Abbey. Other famous people buried here include Charles Darwin, Sir Issac Newton, Aphra Behn, and Charles Dickens. Westminster Abbey costs 29 GBP ( book online in advance here) but you can visit for free if you go during a service. Just be quiet and dress respectfully. Open 9:30am-3:30pm (last entry). On Saturdays, you can tour the Parliament. This is where the UK government conducts its business. Tours last 75 minutes and include visits to the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and Westminster Hall. You'll learn about the history of the building (the first parliament was held in 1265), how the government was created, and how the UK political system functions. Amongst the ornate rooms, there are all kinds of artwork to admire, including statues of Nelson Mandela, Gandhi, and Winston Churchill. Tours are 33 GBP and tickets can be booked online in advance. During July and August, tours are also offered Tuesday-Friday in addition to Saturdays. Eat in Borough Market After that, hop on the tube from Westminster to London Bridge (or walk along the South Bank) and head to the famous Borough Market to grab a meal from one of the many vendors. It's hugely popular with locals, especially around lunchtime. The market here dates back to the 12th century while the building itself is from the 1850s. It's open daily 10am-5pm. Bring an appetite! Wander South London After you've satiated your hunger, wander around South London. See the site of the original Globe Theater (where Shakespeare put on his plays), visit the eerie Crossbones Cemetery that honors the working girls and lost souls of London, walk along the riverfront, marvel at Millennium Bridge, and pop into the Tate Modern for a few hours to take in some of the best modern art London has to offer (it's free). Then head back toward Borough Market for a drink at the George Inn, one of London's oldest pubs and where Charles Dickens used to drink (it's also likely that William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe drank here). The new Globe Theater is also here if you want to take in a Shakespearean play (standing tickets can be found for as little as 5-10 GBP). Planning a trip to Europe?

Get the free guide What to See and Do in London: Day 4 Visit More Museums London is a museum city. It has some of the best in the world, so I suggest you visit a few more before you go: Natural History Museum - There are over 80 million items in this comprehensive museum, including specimens collected by Charles Darwin. It also has a great collection of fossils, making it a fun and educational stop if you're traveling with kids. Cromwell Road, +44 20 7942 5000, nhm. Ac.uk. Open Monday-Sunday from 10am-5:50pm (last entry at 5pm). Admission is free but you should pre-book your ticket online in advance. Science Museum - Founded in 1857, this is actually one of the most popular museums in London, attracting millions of visitors each year. There are some really neat interactive galleries on flight and space, and the temporary exhibitions are usually pretty amazing (though those often cost extra). Exhibition Road, South Kensington, +44 20 7942 4000, sciencemuseum.org.uk. Open daily 10am-6pm. Admission is free but you should pre-book tickets online in advance as they cannot guarantee tickets at the door. Victoria and Albert Museum - Named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, this museum is home to over 2,000 works of art covering over 3,000 years of human history. Cromwell Road, +44 20 7942 2000, vam. Ac.uk. Open daily 10am-5:45pm (10pm on Fridays). Admission is free (temporary exhibits may charge a fee). Eat on Brick Lane Head east to the famous Brick Lane and eat your heart out -- it has some amazing Jewish delis (Beigel Bake is the most famous -- and delicious) and Indian cuisine. On the weekends, this street becomes a bustling flea market and a hub of activity when it fills with antique and flea market sellers, food vendors, and people eating and drinking their way down the street. Take a Jack the Ripper tour Jack the Ripper was a serial killer in London from 1888-1891 with at least 5 murders to his name. He's one of the most infamous killers in the world and every night, you'll find tons of people in the East End learning about Jack the Ripper on a ridiculous number of similar tours. My favorite is the original Jack the Ripper Tour. Their guides are experts on the 19th-century murders and really bring this dark, gruesome topic to life. While dark, the tours are fun and informative, lasting just under two hours and costing 18 GBP. Check the website for times. What to See and Do in London: Day 5 Wander Trafalgar Square Stroll around and admire the fountains and the famous monuments, such as the four bronze lion statues and Nelson's Column. The column honors Admiral Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The naval battle saw over 70 ships and 50,000 men battle for control of the seas, with the English defeating the combined forces of Spain and France. Lots of people hang out here so it makes for a good place to people-watch and takes in the local pace of life. Explore the Tower of London and See the Crown Jewels Built in 1070 by William the Conqueror to defend his royal power, the tower is actually a castle located on the north bank. The fortification was used as a prison and palace and was expanded many times over the centuries. Until the 1800s, weapons and armor were made here and all coins were made here until 1810 under the Royal Mint. Today, it houses the famous crown jewels (royal ceremonial objects, including coronation regalia). Admission is 34.80 GBP ( book your tickets online in advance here). The Tower of London's changing of the guard (known as the Ceremony of the Keys) takes place daily at 9:30pm and is worth seeing. Tickets are free but must be pre-booked because it fills up quickly. Make sure and get there beforehand as they won't let anyone in after 9:25pm. Be sure to also head to nearby Tower Bridge, which opened in 1894 (and a lot of people confuse it with London Bridge). You can access the bridge deck to take in the view or check out the Tower Bridge Exhibition, where you can see the old Victorian engine rooms and get a sense of just how epic an engineering feat the bridge's construction actually was. Open daily 9:30am-6pm. Admission is 13.40 GBP. Take in a Show London is my second favorite theater spot after New York City. You can't leave without seeing a show. Check out TKTS for discounted tickets for shows in the West End. There's always something fun playing! What to See and Do in London: Days 6 & 7 See Stonehenge Stonehenge, located near Salisbury, is one of the oldest man-made structures in the world (it dates back to 2500 BCE). You can't approach the stones anymore as they are now cordoned off, but it's still quite a fascinating site to explore. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, each stone weighs around 25 tons and stands around 4 meters (13 feet) tall. And because Stonehenge was built by a culture that didn't leave any written records, we still have no idea why they built it. The audio guide is a must so you can get some historical context (it's free to download here). Admission ranges from 22.70-27.20 GBP depending on the time of year and you can book your tickets online here (though it's possible to legally visit without paying by taking the nearby pedestrian path). Day Trip to Bath Bath is named after its famous mineral baths and is home to an ancient Roman bath that is marvellously well preserved. The Romans settled here when they invaded Britain because of the hot springs that bubble up from the earth. The locals thought this place had spiritual significance, and when the Romans came, they felt the same and dedicated this site to Minerva, the goddess of wisdom. Despite being on the edge of the frontier, the city grew to become a major religious and cultural center. People came from all around to pray to Minerva and use the baths, which they believed had special healing powers. Admission costs 27-29 GBP on weekends and 24.50-27 GBP on weekdays depending on the season. Audio guides are free. For a more detailed experience, take a guided walking tour around the city with Footprints Tours. You'll learn a ton about the city and have a much more in-depth experience before you explore the baths. Day Trip to Oxford Oxford is home to one of the oldest universities in the world (it was founded in the 11th century as a hub for theological learning). Exploring all the beautiful colleges here makes for a fun day trip. The University is the main attraction here and Bodleian Libraries offers guided tours of the university, including the inside of many historic buildings. During the tour, you'll get a look at university life, the history of the school, the architecture, and more. You can take a 30-, 60-, or 90-minute tour, with costs ranging from 10-20 GBP. Other highlights include South Park, the Bridge of Sighs, the botanical gardens, and punting on the river (pushing a small boat around the River Thames or the River Cherwell with a pole). Day Trip to Cambridge Cambridge is similar to Oxford with some of the best universities, parks, museums, and theatrical productions in the country. I enjoyed the museums, wandering around the parks, and embracing the relaxed pace of life (there are only around 125,000 people here compared to the almost 10 million in London!). Visit the colleges, stroll along the Backs, visit the Fitzwilliam Museum, or go punting. Most people visit for just the day; however, I recommend staying overnight. For such a small city, there's a lot to see and do here! Take Another Walking Tour During a recent visit to London, I tried out over 25 different walking tours.

London. From the iconic British landmarks we've always seen in the movies, to the city's charming markets and sprawling gardens, London has so much to see and do, so is it really possible to cover it all in just 5 days?

Photo credit: @fhanakoo The capital city of the United Kingdom may have a lot to offer, so to make the most out of it, we've done our research and picked out the best things to do, top sights to see and must-eats in the city. Especially if you're a first-time visitor to the city, this 5-day London itinerary is made just for you! Keep reading to find out more. Complete your London experience with these activities! 5D4N London Itinerary Day 1: Soak in London's best sights at South Bank 1. Hop-on hop off bus tour Welcome to London! Since it's your first day, why not explore the city with a hop-on hop-off bus tour ? This is a popular travel mode for most first-time visitors in the city, as you'll get to see and drop by all of London's top attractions at your own pace. In fact, most of the places that we've included in Day 1's itinerary are also stops along the bus routes. With the 24-hour bus ticket that you can get from Klook, you'll get to enjoy unlimited access to the bus tour all-day long, as well as WiFi and an audio guide onboard. In summer and winter, there's even a night bus tour that you can go for in the evening instead, to escape the daytime heat. Get your 24 or 48-hour Hop-on Hop-off Bus Tour ticket here! 2. Tower Bridge & Potters Fields Park Photo credit: @sh. Gwon Start your exploration with none other than London's most famous bridge, the iconic Tower Bridge. Built across the River Thames in the 19th century to connect both the north and south banks of the city, the bridge is easily recognisable from afar with its two huge Gothic towers and blue ironwork. There's even a 43-metre high glass walkway where you can enjoy stunning views of the city from the top of the bridge! Photo credit: @joyfuladventuresuk You can cross the bridge on foot, but it's definitely best admired from the riverbank. Our favourite spot to get the best view would be from Potters Fields Park. Located immediately southwest from the bridge, this park is a popular photo spot, but also as a picnic location! Head up to the Tower Bridge Exhibition in London! 3. Brunch at Borough Market Photo credit: @boroughmarket London is home to a vibrant street food scene, with a wide variety of markets and food halls for you to choose from, but the historic Borough Market is without a doubt one of our personal favourites. You'll be spoiled for choice with the endless options of food at this market, with restaurants, pubs and stalls offering decadent sweet treats and indulgent dishes from all around the world. Note: Borough Market is closed on Mondays, so be sure to plan for a visit on other days instead. 4. The Shard Photo credit: @yana_yushchenko Just a 5-minute walk away from Borough Market is The Shard, once known as the London Bridge Tower. Standing 310 metres tall, this is the tallest building in the United Kingdom! It goes without saying that you'll get incomparable panoramic views of the city from up their observation deck, making it one of London's most popular attractions. Photo credit: Jamie Street There are also plenty of restaurants and bars in The Shard, many that offer window seats with amazing views, so you can even have your lunch here instead of Borough Market if you prefer! 5. Tate Modern Photo credit: @exploringwithmygirl Photo credit: @exploringwithmygirl If you're an art lover, do consider dropping by Tate Modern ! Inside, you'll be presented with innovative contemporary exhibitions and works of art by renowned modern artists of the world. In fact, it is the largest museum of modern art in the United Kingdom, with a permanent collection that includes works by Picasso and Warhol. The best part is that entry into the gallery and most of its exhibitions are free! 6. The London Eye & Jubilee Gardens Photo credit: @jaymicadacquil As the sun sets on your first day in the city, why not take a ride up the majestic London Eye ? Standing at 135-metres tall, this is Europe's tallest ferris wheel and definitely a fun way to enjoy 360-degree views of the London skyline and the River Thames. The whole experience will take about 30 minutes, and do remember to book your spot in advance! Photo credit: @priscindrayadi Situated adjacent to the London Eye is the Jubilee Gardens, where you'll get one of the best photo spots with the iconic ferris wheel in your background. This beautiful landscaped park is always abuzz with pop up events and food stalls, so if you decide not to head up the London Eye, we would recommend hanging out here instead in the evening. Book your slot and tickets for a ride up the London Eye here! 7. Dinner at Waterloo There's no better place for dinner than Waterloo, a busy district that is home to not only a shining theatre scene, but also to many dining options. We'll just name drop a few restaurants that you should definitely check out - the casual Crust Bros or Pizza Pilgrims for pizza, Rosa's Thai or Gogo Pocha if you're craving for Asian flavours, or The Archduke for a good steak. If you've still got some extra energy for the rest of the night, we'd recommend exploring the vibrant nightlife scene here. From elegant rooftop bars to lively pubs, why not pay one or two of them a visit to end your first day in London? Day 2: Discover historical landmarks in Westminster 1. Breakfast in Westminster Photo credit: Ugur Akdemir There's no way better to wake up in London than with an English big breakfast. Start your second day's journey from Westminster, where you can easily find staple British fare. Popular spots you can try include Regency Cafe, Cafe Nuvo, Bill's Victoria Restaurant or Astral Cafe, all of which serve full English breakfasts. 2. Buckingham Palace Photo credit: @zoehu_tw_insuomi Photo credit: Hulki Okan Tabak A must-visit during your five days in London is none other than Buckingham Palace. All decked out in gold and boasting 775 rooms on the inside, you best believe that this royal residence will appear even grander in real life. For first-time visitors, don't miss out on the Changing of the Guard, one of the most recognisable ceremonies associated with the palace. The whole ceremony kicks off at 10.45, but we'd suggest getting here at least 20-30 minutes in advance to secure a good viewing spot, especially during the summertime. Note: The Changing of the Guard only takes place on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, so do plan your visit accordingly! Watch the changing of guards at Buckingham Palace! 3. Westminster Abbey & Big Ben Just a 15-minute walk away from Buckingham Palace is Westminster Abbey. You'd probably recognise the inside of this stunning gothic building - since almost a millennium ago, this has been the coronation church of the monarchs of England, and a stellar royal wedding venue. Go as early as you can as there will be long queues to enter, but going inside isn't completely necessary as you can already get stunning photos from the outside of the abbey due to its impressive architecture. Get your entry tickets for Westminster Abbey here! Afterwards, you should definitely snap a photo with one of London's most recognisable monuments, the Big Ben. Situated right in the heart of the city's historic centre, you'll find the famous tower with its 4 clock faces, standing proud at an impressive 96-metre height, and located inside it is the huge 13-ton bell that the name Big Ben belongs to. #KlookTip: Want a photo with the clock tower? Walk along the Great George Street/A302, where you'll find red phone booths that have become a popular location to capture the Big Ben in the background. Another option is to walk across the Westminster Bridge, where you'll eventually find nice spots to capture not only the tower, but also the Parliament and the River Thames in your photo's backdrop. 4. Trafalgar Square Photo credit: @meganxhan Photo credit: @ain._.pf Head north towards Trafalgar Square, one of London's most important public squares. This lively area is always bustling with activity, be it with public celebrations, live street performances, or even demonstrations. At the centre of it all is its iconic fountains, massive lion statues and the monumental Nelson's column. If you didn't manage to grab breakfast in the morning, there are also plenty of cafes and restaurants here at Trafalgar Square for you to grab lunch or a simple quick bite. Otherwise, you can simply sit back and just people-watch, or why not pay the National Gallery a visit? 5. Hyde Park Fancy a late afternoon stroll? Spanning across 350 acres, the massive Hyde Park is a sprawling green space in London, and a refreshing reprieve from the busy city. As one of London's eight royal parks and also the largest, you can easily spend up to two hours simply just wandering around as you explore its wetlands, gardens, playgrounds, sports facilities, historical monuments, and more. If you're travelling here in the wintertime, you're in luck! Pay the park a visit and you'd be delighted to find the exciting Winter Wonderland amusement park, the annual Christmas market, and even the largest ice rink in the UK, all of which are held here in the colder season. 6. Kensington Gardens & Kensington Palace Photo credit: @muslihainlondon Beyond Hyde Park's west end, you'll find yourself at another stunning park, Kensington Gardens. It is also another one of London's royal parks, and takes up a space of 265 acres, with tons of green space for you to explore. Drop by the Serpentine Galleries for some art, take pictures of the Albert Memorial and Peter Pan Statue, or bring the little ones for playtime at the Diana Memorial Playground. Photo credit: @__utsukushiiiii__ The massive park was once the private gardens of Kensington Palace, which you would find nestled within. The palace is currently the official royal residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and their children, so you can expect nothing less than an impressive structure and lavish rooms housed within. 7. Dinner in Kensington Upscale and packed with energy, the neighbourhood of Kensington may be known for its museums and lively shopping scene, but it also has plenty of cafes and restaurants for you to have your dinner at. Some of our favourite stops are Maggie Jones's, Dishoom, and Da Mario, but you can also check out Publiq or Stick & Bowl for more affordable options. Day 3: Revisit childhood memories in North London 1. Breakfast at King's Cross Photo credit: Andrei Ianovskii There's going to be a bit of walking today, so start your day right with a hearty breakfast! Head to King's Cross, where you can find many breakfast options in the area. You can never go wrong with a cup of coffee and a sandwich from Pret A Manger, but other spots in the area include Giraffe, Caravan King's Cross Restaurant, and Le Pain Quotidien. Photo credit: Sarah Ehlers Opened in 1852, London's King's Cross Station isone of England's most important historic buildings, but it's also a famous stop for a whole other reason. If you're a Harry Potter fan, a visit to the iconic Platform 9 3/4 is a must! While the actual platform does not exist in real life, there's a makeshift Platform 9 3/4 on the wall in the station concourse for you to take photos at, and get yourself official merchandise at the Harry Potter Shop. Interested in a full day tour of Harry Potter filming locations instead? Visit Harry Potter filming locations in London with this tour! 2. Camden Town Spend the rest of your morning and afternoon in Camden Town ! This trendy neighbourhood is known for its massive market and an eclectic mix of great street food, gift and souvenir stops, a diverse selection of stores, as well as live music venues. A must-visit is the Camden Lock Market. With over a 1000 unique stores, stalls and dining outlets, this is probably the largest streetmarket that you can findin the city. You can easily spend hours wandering around here, shopping for handcrafted items, vintage goods, clothing, accessories and more, as well as sampling all of the food. If you're hungry, there's a stretch of street food from all around the world along Regent's Canal. 3. Regent's Park & London Zoo Photo credit: @kananchawla_ Photo credit: @vandanasahni_ Just a 10-minute walk away from Camden Town is the beautiful Regent's Park, another one of the city's royal parks. This massive green space of 410 acres has stunning flower beds, playgrounds for the little ones, a large boating lake, dining outlets, sports fields, and most importantly, lovely paths and alleys for you to go on a quiet stroll through the lush greens. We'd recommend allocating at least 2 hours just to explore this massive park. Did you know that Regent's Park also houses the London Zoo ? Experience a world of wildlife right in the heart of London! A top place to visit for family travellers in the city, the zoo is actually one of the world's oldest scientific zoos, making it more than just your regular zoo. Over 20,000 animals from all over the world call it their home, including sloths, penguins, camels and alpacas. Come by and say hi to these furry friends! Get your tickets for entry to the London Zoo here! 4. Sherlock Holmes Museum Photo credit: @thesherlockholmesmuseum Any fans of the world's greatest detective out there? After your afternoon stroll through the park, head to the nearby 221B Baker Street (yes, the actual one in London!) and pay a visit to none other than the Sherlock Holmes Museum. Paid entry into the museum is required, but you can feel free to drop by their gift shop for free and bring home memorabilia to prove that you've been to Sherlock Holmes' house. 5. Dinner at Baker Street Whether or not you decided to drop by the museum, Baker Street itself, as well as its surrounding area, has many great options for dinner. Our personal recommendation would be to get wholesome burgers at Chicken Shop or comfort stir-fried food at Wok to Walk, but Bill's Baker Street Restaurant, Kitchen at Holmes or Royal China for more refined dining options. 6. Monopoly Lifesized Photo credit: @eattravelyogarepeat Fancy a game of Monopoly after dinner? And not just any Monopoly - in London, take this classic board game to a whole other level with a visit to Monopoly Lifesized ! Opened recently in 2021, this immersive attraction allows you to step into their larger-than-life world of Monopoly, with you being your own lifesized monopoly piece! There are even 4 lifesized boards for you to choose from, in which you can move around completing challenges to buy properties and compete against your friends and family. Day 4: Explore the City of London 1. Breakfast at Ludgate Hill Before a visit to the iconic St. Paul's Cathedral, make sure to get some breakfast to start your day! Ludgate Hill and its surrounding areas offer quick breakfast stops at its various eateries, some of which include Côte St. Paul's, Pret A Manger, Poppins Cafe and Carter Lane Coffee House. 2. St. Paul's Cathedral Kick off your exploration of the City of London district with a visit to the magnificent St. Paul's Cathedral. Built in the late 17th century, you may recognise this stunning Baroque building due to royal events such as the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana. After visiting its historic crypts and viewing the artworks on display downstairs, we'd highly recommend climbing up the building's 528 steps to the top to enjoy stunning views of London along the way, and then visiting the Whispering Gallery and Golden Gallery. Enjoy skip-the-the line admission into St. Paul's Cathedral! 3. Leadenhall Market Photo credit: @applechuaa Take a 15-minute walk to Leadenhall Market, probably one of the most stunning markets and building interiors that you'd find in the city. Built in the 14th century, this building is rich with 700 years of history, and is home to a selection of independent boutique stores, high-end retailers, elegant restaurants and cafes, as well as bars. It's the perfect lunch spot and some of our favourites include Tortilla, Giorgio, Pizza Express, as well as the upscale Bob Bob Ricard City. 4. Sky Garden Enjoy another stunning vantage point of the city from the Sky Garden, London's highest public garden. This leafy oasis is located on top of the walkie talkie skyscraper, treating you to not only a 360-degree view of the capital, but also lush landscaped gardens, refined restaurants, as well as two elegant bars for a midday drink. The best part is that entry is free, but spaces are limited, so do remember to book your slot in advance! 5. St. Dunstan in the East Church Garden If you're not a fan of touristy spots, then St. Dunstan in the East is the perfect hidden gem in the city for you. Once a parish church of England, it was largely destroyed during the Second World War, and now the ruins of this abandoned church have become a public garden space. This green oasis is a lovely retreat from the busy city outside of it, with a fountain, all sorts of trees growing within, and vines flourishing the historic walls. 6. Tower of London Built close to a thousand years ago, the famous Tower of London is an ancient fortress that has served as a royal palace, a prison, as well as a place of execution. It's no doubt that this is a must-visit, especially if you're a history buff, and you can easily spend more than an hour exploring the grounds. One of the highlights include the Crown Jewels, a mesmerising display of jewel-studded crowns and sceptres, but we personally also enjoy going on a stroll through the lush outdoor gardens. #KlookTip: Many would recommend visiting and queueing early in the morning to avoid the crowds, but we personally like visiting it towards the end of the day because the largest crowds will generally start to thin out after 3 in the afternoon. Join this guided half-day tour of landmarks in the City of London! 7. River Thames Dinner Cruise It's your last night in London, so why not treat yourself to a memorable dinner cruise along the River Thames ? As the sun sets over the city, hop onto a luxurious showboat and get ready to indulge in a delicious four-course dinner with your loved ones. You'll even get to enjoy fun performances onboard, as well as stunning views of the city lit up at night! Book a dinner cruise in London here! Day 5: Go shopping at Covent Garden, Mayfair & Soho 1. Breakfast at Covent Garden Photo credit: @olichka_art Photo credit: @thefairywoods Boasting a fantastic collection of shops, cafes, restaurants, and market stalls, Covent Garden and its Italian-style arcades are a shopper's paradise! There are three different markets in this district, including the famous Apple Market where you can find a range of unique handmade crafts, jewellery, antiques and more. There are also plenty of artist workshops and street performances that you can find in the area. But before you begin shopping, why not grab a quick brekkie at one of Covent Garden's many restaurants? A few of our personal favourite spots are Bill's Covent Garden, Fernando's, 26 Grains, and Lilly's Cafe. 2. British Museum Photo credit: Nicolas Lysandrou Photo credit: @fhanakoo Probably the most famous museum in the city, the British Museum holds an impressive collection of exhibits from all over the world, with over 100,000 antiquities that date back thousands of years. You can easily lose yourself in this museum's maze-like corridors and spend hours inside as you admire one exhibit after another, so to save some time, here are a few of our favourite ones that we'd recommend - the Parthenon Sculptures in Room 18, the Rosetta Stone in Room 4, and the Aztec Serpent in Room 27. Want to take your time to enjoy the museum the entire day? Don't worry as there are various restaurants and cafes located inside, to refuel yourself whenever you feel like it.

When I sat down to plan how I was going to spend 4 days in London, I knew I had my work cut out for me. After all - when you think of European countries with must-see architecture and landmarks, London is definitely one of the first that comes to mind. Let's start with the facts: London has a LOT of tourist attractions. A LOT of must-see architecture. And a LOT of famous locations. Numerous scenes from Harry Potter and Game of Thrones were filmed here, and let's not forget Abbey Road and Kings Cross Station. The downside? All these things aren't exactly close to each other. Figuring out how to spend 4 days in London in order to do all the sightseeing required a LOT of Google maps and strategic planning. To save you the time and trouble, I'm sharing my entire itinerary with you here! It's important to know that the culture in London is a lot different than you might expect. For cultural tips, where to stay, and how to get around, check out my other post - London Travel Tips (For Your First Visit!). This blog post is part of a series of 3 destination posts that encompasses my 2022 Eurotrip to Paris, London, and Madrid. I planned all 3 destinations for me and my friend Kelly, who accompanied me on this journey! To view the Paris post, click here To view the Madrid post, click here Trafalgar Square London Tours and Attractions from Get Your Guide I have some of these tours linked in individual sections below. To browse all London tours from Get Your Guide, click this link: Website Disclaimer: I visited London in July 2022. Although everything is accurate as of the publication of this post, it is important to keep in mind that prices, attractions, and other things may change with time. 4 Days in London: The Itinerary Table of Contents Day 1 - Tower Bridge, King's Cross Station, St. Pancras Hotel, Authentic British Pubs Day 2 - House of Parliament/Big Ben, The London Eye, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, Afternoon Tea, Jack the Ripper Tour, The Shard Day 3 - Oxford + Warner Bros Studios Day Trip, The Chocolate Cocktail Club Day 4 - Abbey Rd, Piccadilly Circus/SoHo, Selfridges & Co, British Pub Crawl 4 Days in London - The Itinerary Day 1: Travel Day - Tower Bridge, King's Cross Station, St. Pancras Hotel, & Authentic British Pubs Our flight landed in London from Paris at around 10:30am the morning of our arrival. By time we got to our hotel, it was around noon, so we set off to find lunch and do some exploring. FYI: It should be noted that two of the attractions in this section, Tower Bridge and King's Cross Station, are a bit far from each other. However, doing them both in the same day was the best way to fit these 2 things into the itinerary overall. 1. Tower Bridge Like I previously mentioned, the aesthetic of London is NYC meets medieval times. The construction of Tower Bridge definitely falls into the medieval times category. It is massive, gorgeous, and unlike any bridge I've ever seen. You can even purchase tickets to tour the bridge and walk across the glass at the top! The road that spans Tower Bridge also opens up in a drawbridge-type fashion to allow boats and other vessels to pass through the Thames River. Fun Fact: Tower Bridge is NOT considered a drawbridge due to the mechanism by which the roads are pulled up. Tower Bridge is actually a \"bascule bridge,\" because it doesn't require ropes or chains for the roads to come up the way a true drawbridge would. Tower Bridge is one of London's most iconic and recognizable landmarks. It is built near the Tower of London, which is a historic castle that you are also able to tour. You can purchase tickets to go inside the Tower of London and see the crown jewels, walk through the different towers, see the fortress, and more. 2. King's Cross Station (For The Harry Potter Fans!) From Tower Bridge, we decided to go to King's Cross Station and St. Pancras Hotel. These locations were a must-see for us (for 2 very important reasons!), but they were also a good bit out of the way from some of the other tourist things we wanted to do. In terms of time, it made the most sense to fit them in on our travel day. If you are a Harry Potter fan, you've definitely heard of King's Cross station. The train station made famous in the series for Platform 9 3/4, which Harry crosses to board the Hogwarts Express, actually does exist. Well... kind of. Going to Hogwarts! In between Platforms 9 & 10, they have a trolley half hidden in the wall, as if it were crossing through into the wizarding world. Right next to the trolley is a Harry Potter store. You are allowed to get your photo taken with the trolley, which the Harry Potter employees help facilitate. You are even allowed to pick out which color scarf you want for your respective House (and if you don't know your House, you can take this quiz on Wizarding World - previously known as Pottermore - to find out!). Fun fact: I am a Slytherin, and we're not all bad ;) (Another) Fun Fact: the Harry Potter scenes were actually filmed between Platforms 4 & 5, but they placed the trolley in its rightful theatrical place for photos. 3. St. Pancras Hotel (For the Spice Girls Fans!) Right next to King's Cross station is St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel, an absolutely huge, gorgeous hotel that is 100% worth seeing. In fact, it is so stunningly beautiful that the King's Cross exterior shots were filmed here for the Harry Potter movies, instead of at the actual train station. St. Pancras Hotel in London, England Aside from Harry Potter, the main reason I wanted to visit this hotel is because the Spice Girls filmed the video for \" Wannabe \" on the steps inside. You are able to go in and take your photo on these steps and, well, spice up your life. If you grew up in the 90's, you know what a huge deal this is. I spent countless hours singing and dancing to the music video for this song when it came on TV, and now I was standing on the actual steps it was filmed on. Wild. When you come in the main hotel entrance, you can find the steps by going off to your left out of the main room once you leave the entryway. If you're unsure, one of the hotel employees will be able to show you.... And for the record, my favorite Spice Girl is Posh Spice! 4. And Finally... Hit Up an Authentic British Pub We ended our travel day/first day by trying fish & chips at an authentic British pub. But how do you know which pubs are authentic? From a local: \"the corner pubs are the most authentic.\" Traditional pubs will typically have a painted wooden sign outside with the pub name in fancy old English script. We took this advice, found a corner pub bestowed with an old yet authentic looking sign, and had the best fish & chips of our life. The pub we found was called The Marquis Cornwallis, but I'm sure any authentic pub can give you incredible London food! It is worth mentioning that there is a certain \"etiquette\" when it comes to ordering a beer at an English pub, and unfortunately, Kelly and I learned this the hard way. To save yourself the embarrassment, read the \"Pub Etiquette\" section of my other London post. Day 2: Full Day - House of Parliament & Big Ben, The London Eye, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, Afternoon Tea, Jack the Ripper Tour & The Shard If you just read that and thought, \"phew, that's a lot!\"...well, you're right. I tend to take the \"I'll sleep when I'm dead\" approach when I'm on vacation. If you find that this is too much for you to fit in one day, my suggestion would be to move either the Jack the Ripper tour and/or the Shard to Day 4 of this post. 1. House of Parliament/Big Ben Seeing the House of Parliament and Big Ben is, of course, a must do when you go to London. Big Ben is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world, and was every bit as beautiful in person as I imagined it would be. Big Ben is attached to the House of Parliament, the oldest royal palace in London. The architecture, not to mention the gold on the outside, is absolutely stunning. To arrive here by Tube, you will exit at the Westminster tube station - but be warned, this station, not to mention entire area, is crowded. Watch for pickpockets! House of Parliament/Big Ben 2. Ride The London Eye From Big Ben, you can walk across the Westminster Bridge to the London Eye. Not only is the bridge itself beautiful, but you will be able to get some stunning photos from the bridge as well! The London Eye The London Eye is a huge ferris wheel with massive pods that you are able to ride to get top-notch views of the city. You can book tickets in advance, or you can also book when you get there (but tickets will be more expensive). They also have a skip-the-line option (but, let's be honest, there will still be a line. It might just move faster if you choose that ticket). You will be able to get views of the House of Parliament/Big Ben, The Shard, different palaces, the Thames River, and more. This is a super relaxing activity and a perfect way to rest your feet after all that walking! Views from the London Eye - The Shard and the city center Views from the London Eye - Big Ben/House of Parliament, Westminster Bridge, and the Thames River 3. Tour Westminster Abbey After riding the London Eye, you will have roughly a 13 minute walk to Westminster Abbey. I had every intention of touring Westminster Abbey, but unfortunately did not get to. The day I was there, they were having an event and you weren't able to go inside. However, Westminster Abbey is going to be one building that I absolutely recommend you tour. I have been told by numerous people that it is a must-do, and judging by photos of the inside, they aren't wrong. Westminister Abbey You can choose any of these activities from Get Your Guide to tour Westminster Abbey: 4. Admire Buckingham Palace From Westminster Abbey, it is about a 15 minute walk to Buckingham Palace. You are able to tour the palace as well, but there are more restrictions. Buckingham Palace only has tours in the summer months, and since the royals still live and work there, it is limited on what all you get to see. You are able to watch the Changing of the Guards at Buckingham Palace every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday at 10:45am. If this is on your bucket list, you may want to restructure this part of the itinerary and come earlier in the day before you see Big Ben/House of Parliament. If you desire to see this, you can book this Buckingham Palace with Changing of the Guards ticket from Get Your Guide here! Buckingham Palace 5. Trafalgar Square and Afternoon Tea From Buckingham Palace, it's about an 18 minute walk to Trafalgar Square. This is a lively square with a picturesque fountain that is surrounded by restaurants and pubs, statues, and historic buildings. By now, you must be exhausted, so this is also a great place to stop for some afternoon tea, a popular British tradition. Taking a break by one of the fountains at Trafalgar Square Getting afternoon tea is one of those cultural must-do's when you come to London, even if you're someone who, like me, hates hot tea. /shrug After seeing Trafalgar Square, we decided on a restaurant called The Admiralty that served afternoon tea with a small scone. You could also get lunch here if you wanted, along with your tea. A lot of places will advertise that they do afternoon tea on their signs outside, so no matter where you are, it's easy to get your tea fix. I wouldn't go out of your way to plan for this! 6. Jack the Ripper Tour Who doesn't love a good serial killer tour? A local guide takes you through the streets in a (rather sketchy) part of London and shows you where Jack the Ripper killed his victims, along with teaching you about the history of the city during the late 1800's. I booked this tour through the official website, and would absolutely recommend it. Our tour guide was extremely knowledgable, funny, and very entertaining. We also saw parts of London that we would never have gone to on our own through this tour. Pro Tip: If one serial killer experience is not enough for you, they also have the Jack the Ripper Museum in London as well! 7. The Shard - View From the Top The Shard The Shard is the tallest building in the UK and one of the most recognizable buildings in London. It is unique in that it houses a variety of different things, from offices to hotel rooms to a public viewing gallery and more. There are also 7 different restaurants and bars to choose from. We ended our night by having drinks from Aqua Shard - a bar on the 31st floor of the building. From here, we were able to unwind from our long day with breathtaking views of the city! Pro Tip: Make a reservation, just in case! View of the city from the Aqua Shard Day 3: Full Day - Oxford + Warner Bros Studios Day Trip, and The Chocolate Cocktail Club 1. Oxford + Warner Bros Studios - The Making of Harry Potter I booked a day trip for us through Get Your Guide to visit Oxford, England, as well as tour Warner Bros. Studios - The Making of Harry Potter. You are able to see the sets, props, costumes, and more that were used when filming all 8 Harry Potter movies. You can book JUST the studio tour if you want, but Get Your Guide also has an option where you spend the morning exploring Oxford and then go to Warner Bros Studios after. Oxford University Overall, I 10/10 recommend doing the Warner Bros Studio tour with the Oxford add-on if you can. If you are a Harry Potter fan, this will be life-changing. At the end of our Eurotrip, Kelly and I both agreed it was our favorite thing that we did the entire 2 weeks we were in Europe. 2. The Chocolate Cocktail Club In a country that is essentially known for its beer and pubs, finding out that there was a bar dedicated to chocolate cocktails in London was a dream. I chose to make a reservation here after coming back from the Oxford/Harry Potter tour because it sounded like the perfect way to relax after a long day... and it was. The Chocotini The Chocolate Cocktail Club has an extensive drink menu dedicated to (what else?) chocolate themed cocktails. You are able to buy a ticket (in the form of a reservation) that includes one free drink of your choice. You are able to choose between 3 different cocktails, including their signature cocktail, the Chocotini. My 2nd drink - the \"Nutty for Chocolate\" They also have a food menu that includes small bites to go along with your drinks. We got the charcuterie board and it was amazing! The (chocolate themed) charcuterie board You are also able to get your afternoon tea fix here! The Chocolate Cocktail Club offers a selection of sandwiches, scones, and cakes that are deliciously paired with hot chocolate, tea, or coffee. You can also get a Chocotini cocktail or Prosecco for an up-charge. If there are any chocolate haters in your group, they have a completely separate menu of regular drinks including wine, beer, gin, and soft drinks. Day 4: Last Full Day - Abbey Road, Piccadilly Circus/SoHo, Selfridges & Co., and a Pub Crawl 1. Walk the Abbey Road Crosswalk Even if you aren't a Beatles fan, getting your photo taken in the iconic Abbey Road crosswalk is, in my opinion, a must-do when you go to London. After all - it's not every day that you have the opportunity to walk in the literal footsteps of the most influential band of all time! Abbey Road Crosswalk Abbey Road is a bit out of the way from the rest of the tourist attractions we were going to do, which is why we decided to save this for our last day. However, finding the right crosswalk can be a bit confusing. How to Find The Abbey Road Crosswalk When searching for the location, it is important to type in \" The Beatles crosswalk \" into your Google maps, and NOT \"Abbey Road.\" Typing in \"Abbey Road\" will take you near a crosswalk, but it is NOT the correct one. Want to know the worst part? If you type in \"Abbey Road,\" Google maps will label it as \"Road seen on the iconic Beatles album.\" (See photo below on the left). This is wrong!! What you want to see is the roads coming together to form a triangular shape, and the red location marker is ACTUALLY on a crosswalk. (See photo on the right). You will also know you are at the right location because there will be groups of people waiting to take their iconic photo. This location is NOT CORRECT This location IS CORRECT 2. Explore Piccadilly Circus From Abbey Rd, it is about a 30 minute Tube ride to Piccadilly Circus and SoHo. GETTING HERE: Walk to the ST. JOHN'S WOOD station and get on the JUBILEE line towards STRATFORD on Platform 2. Exit at the GREEN PARK station. Walk ~12 minutes. Some of the buildings and decor of Piccadilly Circus Piccadilly Circus is a popular tourist destination and the most famous square in the West End of London. It serves as a junction that connects 6 very busy streets, and is one of the notable Harry Potter filming locations. There are giant, \"Times Square\" looking screens showing advertisements on the buildings, and the whole area is buzzing with people. For the Harry Potter fans, the scene where Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape the Death Eaters at Bill and Fleur's wedding from Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows was filmed here! This is a really fun area to walk around and explore. The architecture is beautiful, there are great restaurants, and the Eros Fountain is a sight to behold. I did not get a good photo of it, but it is a large fountain with essentially what looks like a statue of Cupid on top. I later learned that in Roman mythology, Cupid is equivalent to Eros, the Greek god of carnal love! In fact, this is where the word \"erotic\" comes from. Fun Fact: Even though the fountain is called Eros Fountain, the \"cupid\" on top is actually supposed to be Anteros, Eros's brother! 3. Walk Through the Colorful Streets of SoHo SoHo in the daytime SoHo at night SoHo is a lively, fun neighborhood with tons of bars, restaurants, and shops within walking distance from Piccadilly Circus. Kelly and I stumbled upon SoHo as we were exploring Piccadilly Circus, so I grouped them together for the sake of this post. In SoHo amidst the restaurants and shops, there are neon string lights hanging from the buildings that adds to the already \" this is the place to be! \" vibe once it gets dark. If you haven't already guessed, this was my favorite neighborhood. SoHo at night SoHo shopping suggestion: astrid & miyu In SoHo, they have a store called Astrid & Miyu where you can hop on the welded jewelry trend and get a bracelet permanently welded onto your wrist. The chains are made from high quality metal, and they also have charms you can choose from. I thought it would be the perfect way for me to always remember my 2022 Eurotrip, so I opted to get a rose gold bracelet with a matching rose gold charm. Astrid & Miyu accepts walk-ins, but due to this being a popular trend, it's best to make an appointment. I actually first learned about this trend (and got my first bracelet!) in Nashville, which you can read about in my Nashville blog post. SoHo Pub suggestion: shakespeare's Head We also stumbled upon this pub called Shakespeare's Head, which was founded by 2 men who were distant relatives of William Shakespeare. It's a very picturesque, traditional Old English pub with a good beer selection. Located in the heart of SoHo, it's a great place to grab a pint and people watch! Shakespeare's Head in SoHo 3. Walk Through Selfridges & Co. Pro Tip: If you aren't much of a shopper, Selfridge's isn't a must-do. If you are, you should definitely walk through it! Selfridges is with out a doubt the largest, boujee-est department store I have ever set foot in. It is located in a massive building right near SoHo. Think of every upscale department store you have ever frequented and multiply it by 50, then add wine, food, chocolates, charcuterie, and even flowers and plants. Yes, it is expensive. But if you are in the mood to treat yo'self, or even just want somewhere to walk around and admire all the pretty things, Selfridge's is the way to go. If you aren't much of a shopper, you will probably be overwhelmed. If you are a shopper, this will likely be your paradise. 4. And Finally... Do a Pub Crawl If you read my Paris Itinerary Post, you knew this was coming. Kelly and I did a \"crawl\" in every city that we visited, and the crawl was based around the drink that was most popular in that particular city. In London, doing a pub crawl around SoHo was the perfect way to end our last day. I would tell you all the pubs that we went to, but if I'm being honest, I don't remember them all. The London beer will do that to you. But here's the thing - you really can't go wrong. There are hundreds upon hundreds of pubs, and they will all give you your beer fix. I tended to navigate towards the corner pubs that were painted black with colorful flowers on the outside, because, well... aesthetics. If you don't know what I'm talking about yet, you will. They're everywhere. Pro Tip: don't forget that the bar etiquette in London is somewhat different than in the United States. In order to be prepared, and for other tips that I didn't know (but wish I would have), check out my other London post: London Travel Tips (For Your First Visit!)"}]}

It's one of my favorite destinations in the entire world and a city that would take a lifetime to see. I've been to the city more times than I remember -- I even moved there for a while -- yet I've barely scratched its surface. Understandably, planning a trip to Paris is hard. Just when you think you've seen everything the city has to offer, you find new attractions, new cafés, or new markets to explore (not to mention visiting Disneyland Paris). There are layers to this city -- which is partially why I love it so much. Most travelers seem to visit Paris for around three days before moving on. They see the highlights, snap some photos, and move on. While three days is better than nothing, I think you need more time than that. Ideally, I think you should plan on spending at least five days in Paris in order to see the bare minimum of what the City of Lights has to offer. There's just too much to do. To help you plan your trip to Paris and figure out what to see, what to do, where to stay, and where to eat, here's my suggested itinerary for a five-day visit (and some other suggestions in case you decide to spend longer there!) Paris Itinerary Highlights Day 1: Champs-Élysées, Arc de Triomphe, the Latin Quarter, & more! Day 2: Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, Musée de l'Orangerie, & more! Day 3: The Palace of Versailles, Père Lachaise Cemetery, & more! Day 4: Eiffel Tower, Les Invalides, Holocaust Museum, & more! Day 5: Paris Catacombs, Rue Mouffetard, Musée de Cluny, & more! Where to Eat: My Favorite Restaurants in Paris What to See in Paris: Day 1 Spend your first day walking around Paris. There's a lot to see, and you can spend a good half day (or whole day) wandering the cobblestone streets, parks, and neighborhoods of the city. If you want to orient yourself with a free walking tour, New Europe runs regular walking tours that cover the highlights. Just make sure to tip your guide at the end. For paid tours, check out Take Walks. They are my go-to walking tour company when I want something more in-depth and informative. They have all kinds of walking tours (as well as museum and food tours). There's something for every interest! However, if you want to follow my own walking tour, here's my suggested route for an \"orientation walk\" around Paris: Start at the Champs-Élysées and see the Arc de Triomphe. There isn't usually a line, and you'll get sweeping views of the city to start your day. Stroll down the Champs-Élysées and through Place de la Concorde, where you will see the Luxor Obelisk, which the French stole from the Egyptians. It's over 3,000 years old and stands 75-meters (246 feet) tall. This square was also where they guillotined people during the French Revolution (1789-1799). Walk down the Champs-Élysées through the Jardin des Tuileries, a beautiful garden that was once home to a palace that burned down in the 1800s. Stop and admire the Louvre before continuing down Rue Rivoli and crossing into the original section of the city on the Île de la Cité. This is where the Romans built their original settlement, (called Lutetia, which was the basis for the modern-day city of Paris. Enjoy the Pont Neuf and the statue of Henry IV. This stone bridge, the first in Paris, was built in 1578. Stroll to my favorite church of all time, Sainte Chapelle, with its incredible 12th-century stained glass. There's usually a line, so book tickets in advance. You'll skip the huge line (sometimes the wait is over an hour). After that, head to the underground Roman ruins and then visit Notre Dame, the world's most famous Gothic church. It was damaged in a fire in 2019 and is still closed, however, you can still admire the building as it's still being repaired. Next, head south toward the Latin Quarter. This area is rather touristy but if you get off the main drag, you'll find yourself in a labyrinth of alleys and café-lined squares that are far away from the local tourist hangouts. Visit the Pantheon and honor France's most famous dead citizens before heading west toward the Jardin du Luxembourg, where you can relax and watch life go by. There's great people-watching here, and it's one of the best parks in the city. After that, head north to see Saint Sulpice. If you're into The Da Vinci Code, you'll be looking for symbols and hidden meanings throughout this church. If symbols don't interest you, just marvel at how grandiose this place is. By this time, it should be late in the afternoon and a perfect time to stop in a café, order some wine, and relax the Parisian way. What to See in Paris: Day 2 The Louvre With over a million pieces of art, you could spend a whole month in the Louvre and still not see everything. I don't particularly enjoy medieval art; it's too religious for me, and I can only see so many pictures of Mary and Jesus before I get bored. If that's not your thing, there are plenty of impressionist period gems like Monet, Renoir, Cézanne, and other masters. Nevertheless, the museum is worth seeing, and I spent about five hours exploring all the masterpieces and marveling at the old royal palace. You could easily spend more time if you're an art buff too. If you'd just like to see the highlights, expect to spend a couple of hours. Timed skip-the-line tickets cost 17 EUR. Post-Covid, you definitely want to get these as they often run out of tickets as, to deal with the crowds, they have started limited the number of visitors per day. You can also take a guided tour around the Louvre (which also skips the line) if you really want to dive into the incredible art in this museum. You'll learn much, much more this way. Musée du Louvre, 1st arrondissement, +33 1 40 20 53 17, louvre. Fr. Open Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and weekends from 9am-6pm, and Fridays from 9am-9:45pm. Closed Tuesdays. Admission is 17 EUR. They also offer free admission for all visitors on the first Sunday of each month October-March and on Bastille Day (14 July). Admission is also free for EU residents under 26. To avoid the massive lines, enter via the Carrousel du Louvre entrance and you'll get right to the ticket counter. You can also skip the lines if you have a Paris Museum Pass. Musée d'Orsay The Musée d'Orsay, located in close proximity to the Louvre, houses the best impressionist and post-impressionist work in Paris. It's one of the largest museums in Europe and my favorite museum in Paris. I always go when I'm in town. The museum sees over 3 million visitors each year and is home to masterpieces by all the great artists of the world, including Degas, Monet, Manet, and Van Gogh, to name a few. I could spend hours here and never get bored. 1 Rue de la Légion d'Honneur, 7th arrondissement, +33 1 40 49 48 14, musee-orsay. Fr. Open Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday-Sunday from 9:30am-6pm and Thursdays from 9:30am-9:45pm. Closed Mondays. Admission is 17 EUR (or 9 EUR after 4:30pm every day but Thursday). It's free on the first Sunday of the month. Be sure to buy tickets in advance so you can skip the long line. Musée de l'Orangerie Finish off a wild museum day with this Monet showcase. The museum displays eight tapestry-sized Nymphéas (water lilies), housed in two plain oval rooms. Monet painted these images later in his life, and each one represents a different time of day and season. There's a bottom floor that shows other works too. It's a beautiful museum. Jardin des Tuileries, Place de la Concorde, 1st arrondissement, +33 1 44 50 43 00, musee-orangerie. Fr. Open Wednesday-Monday from 9am-6pm; last entry at 5:15pm. Closed Tuesdays. Admission is 12.50 EUR and is free on the first Sunday of the month. Budget travel tip: Get the Paris Museum Pass. This pass covers over 50 museums and attractions in Paris. It covers all the museums above, so getting this pass and using it to see all the attractions listed in this article will save you a ton of money. A two-day pass costs 55 EUR, a four-day pass costs 70 EUR, and a six-day pass costs 85 EUR. Plus, it will let you skip all the long lines that these attractions have. NOTE: People will say \"That's too much to do in a day! Those museums take a day each!\" And they are right. These museums can actually take DAYS to see. But, if you're short on time, you can see the highlights of each in a very long day. Or don't and take your time in each museum. This itinerary is just a mere suggestion anyways!

Get the free guide What to See in Paris: Day 3 The Palace of Versailles Located just outside of Paris, the Palace of Versailles was a hunting lodge before becoming the primary residence of the Kings of France until the French Revolution. A decadent symbol of royal power, the palace sees over 10 million visitors each year. It takes a full day to really enjoy a trip here. Spend the day exploring the château, get lost in the surrounding gardens, and soak up the extravagant lifestyle of France's former monarchy. Make sure you see the estate of Trianon (known as Marie Antoinette's estate) as well, which includes a fake peasant village created to provide scenic views and fresh milk and eggs for the Queen. Versailles is massive and beautiful so don't rush your visit. Most people see the Palace first, then the gardens, and then Marie-Antoinette's estate. If you do everything in reverse, you'll be able to avoid the crowds. Additionally, go on a weekday to avoid the worst of the crowds. If you really want a deep dive, take a guided tour of Versailles with Walks. You'll not only skip the line (which will save you a ton of time) but you'll get an expert local guide who can really bring the history to life. Here's a video tour of the Palace of Versailles to whet your appetite: Place d'Armes, Versailles, +33 1 30 83 78 00, en. Chateauversailles. Fr. Open Tuesday-Sunday 9am-5:30pm with the last entry at 5pm. Closed Mondays. \"The Passport\" ticket gives you admission to all the palace tours (grounds, Trianon Palaces, and Marie Antoinette's estate), the Musical Fountain Show, the Musical Gardens, and the exhibitions for 28.50 EUR (21.50 EUR during the low season). Guided tours with GYG that skip-the-line cost 55 EUR. I highly recommend a guided tour because there's not a lot of signage in the building so you don't really get any context around what you are seeing. Père Lachaise Cemetery Finish off the day with a train ride east of the city center to visit Paris's most famous graveyard, where you'll see the graves of celebrities like Antonio de La Gandara, Honoré de Balzac, Sarah Bernhardt, Frédéric Chopin, Jim Morrison, Édith Piaf, Camille Pissarro, Gertrude Stein, and Oscar Wilde. Built in 1804, it's named after Louis XIV's confessor, Père François de la Chaise (1624-1709), who lived in a house near the cemetery. Initially, the locals considered the cemetery too far from the city so administrators devised a plan. They moved the remains of Jean de La Fontaine (fabulist) and Molière (playwright), two of Paris's most famous artists, to Père Lachaise, hoping that people would want to be buried near France's famous heroes. It worked, and today it's the city's most iconic graveyard -- and the most visited cemetery in the world. Just make sure you're out before it closes at 5:30pm. Guided tours cost 20 EUR and last three hours. I recommend taking a tour if you can. There's not a lot of signage here so you don't really get any information about the cemetery without a tour. What to See in Paris: Day 4 Eiffel Tower The Eiffel Tower is Paris' most iconic monument. Built in the 1880s for the 1889 World Fair, it was actually disliked by many people when it was first built. Today, the locals love it; it's a symbol of the city and one of the most recognized buildings in the world. Standing 324 meters (1,062 feet) tall, it offers the best views of the entire city. To beat the crowds, get here early in the morning. If you wait until the afternoon, you'll find yourself waiting in line for hours. Afterward, have a picnic on the grass and enjoy the sunshine and the views. It's one of my favorite things to do in the city. Champ de Mars, 7th arrondissement, +33 8 92 70 12 39, toureiffel.paris. Open daily (9am-midnight) during the summer, with slightly shorter hours during the rest of the year. Admission is 18.10-28.30 EUR per person, depending on how high you go. You can also pay for direct access to an elevator that takes you to the top for 35 EUR. Wander Rue Cler Located near the Eiffel Tower, this street is filled with good Parisian eateries. You'll find cheese, meat, bread, vegetable, and chocolate stores to explore. I never walk away from this street without a pile of food and wine. Whenever I'm here, I eat my way through this street and then buy more for later. It's one of my favorite streets in Paris. Paris Sewer Museum This tour is definitely an off-the-beaten-path attraction and isn't too far away from the Eiffel Tower. You'll learn about the interesting history of Paris's sewer system. You may be put off by the idea of a \"sewer tour,\" but don't be. It doesn't smell down there and you'll learn how modern Paris came to be. Before there was a suitable drainage system, waste from the city just ended up in the river. It then spread disease and polluted the entire area, putting the entire city at risk. It wasn't until the city developed a complex sewer system that it was able to overcome diseases, boost trade, and develop into the world-class city that it is today. Pont de l'Alma, Left Bank, opposite 93 Quai d'Orsay, 7th arrondissement, +33 1 53 68 27 81, musee-egouts.paris. Fr/en/. Open Tuesday to Sunday from 10am-5pm. Admission is 9 EUR. Les Invalides (The Tomb of Napoleon) Also known as Hôtel National des Invalides, this enormous complex was built in 1670 by Louis XIV as a hospital for wounded soldiers. Nowadays, it's home to several museums and monuments, including the Musée de l'Armée (the Military Museum of the Army of France) and Napoleon's tomb. It is one of the most comprehensive history museums I've ever visited, and you'll need at least three hours to see it properly. While military history may seem boring, this museum is really a history of France, the Revolution, and Napoleon. It is fascinating and incredible in its depth. I cannot recommend it enough. Place des Invalides, Musée de l'Armée, 129 Rue de Grenelle, 7th arrondissement, +33 810 11 33 99. Open daily from April through October (10am-6pm; Tuesdays until 9pm), and 10am-5pm from November through March. Admission is 14 EUR. The Museum of the Shoah (The Holocaust Museum) Despite having an excellent exhibit on France, anti-Semitism, and the Holocaust, the Museum of the Shoah never draws a lot of people. It's a real shame, as the information and collection here is really great and in-depth. I've been to many Holocaust museums, and this is one of the best and most detailed in the world. I highly recommend it. 17 Rue Geoffroy l'Asnier, 4th arrondissement, +33 1 42 77 44 72, memorialdelashoah.org. Open Sunday-Friday 10am-6pm and Thursdays from 10am-10pm. Closed Saturdays. Admission is free and a free guided tour is given at 3pm (in English) on the second Sunday of every month. What to See in Paris: Day 5 Paris Catacombs The Catacombs of Paris are a fascinating but grim tourist attraction. They go on for miles (no one really knows how far) and the endless winding tunnels house thousands of bones. Only a small section of the tunnels is open, and there's a ton of history and information about the growth of Paris. The Catacombs themselves are actually old stone quarries that were located far outside the edge of the city during medieval times. There's always a long line, so book your skip-the-line tickets online beforehand and don't wait outside. Because that line can take hours! 1 Avenue du Colonel Henri Rol-Tanguy, 14th arrondissement, +33 1 43 22 47 63, catacombes.paris. Fr. Open Tuesday-Sunday 9:45am-8:30pm; last admission at 7:30pm. Closed Mondays. Check the website before you go -- the Catacombs are sometimes closed without warning or explanation. Admission is 18 EUR for last-minute tickets sold the day of. The audio guide is 5 EUR. Advanced tickets are 29 EUR (including the audio guide). Rue Mouffetard This pedestrian street is filled with cafés and shops and has an outdoor market. It's great to just wander down or for sitting in front of a café and watch Parisian life go by. Make sure to stop by the nearby Place de la Contrescarpe too. There are some good and inexpensive restaurants in the area, making it a nice place to stop for a while and watch life go by. Musée de Cluny The Cluny Museum, also known as the National Museum of the Middle Ages, is the finest surviving example of medieval architecture in Paris. Built in the 15th century, it was the former home of the abbots of Cluny and now houses Roman and medieval art, including many architectural fragments found during excavations around the city. The museum also contains the adjoining rooms of a Roman bath, which the abbey was built over. It is by far one of the most interesting history museums in the city and worth every euro of the admission fee! 6 Place Paul Painlevé, 5th arrondissement, +33 1 53 73 78 16, musee-moyenage. Fr. Open Tuesday to Sunday 9:30am-6:15pm. Closed Mondays. Admission is 12 EUR and free on the first Sunday of every month. Bibliothèque Nationale de France One of the grandest libraries in the world, the Bibliothèque Nationale de France was founded in 1368 by Charles V. Stop in for a quick visit and be sure to take a peek at the old rotunda of the art library and the 20-foot globes in the permanent collection. The collection is massive at over 40 million items, including some 15 million books and over 5,000 manuscripts from Ancient Greece. Quai François Mauriac, 13th arrondissement, +33 1 53 79 59 59, bnf. Fr. Open Monday from 2pm-8pm), Tuesday-Saturday from 9am-8pm, and Sundays from 1pm-7pm. Admission is free. Montmartre Another artistic center of Paris, this is where artists and writers like Hemingway spent their time. There's still a lot of art, and you'll find galleries and artists throughout the area. The streets are quiet and beautiful to wander around. Sacré-Cœur (the church here) offers a superb view of the city and is a great place to have lunch. You can also see the famous \"sinking house\" here too (an Insta-famous house that, from the right angle, looks like it's sinking into the hill). It's a great area to take a food tour too. In the evening, the stairs near the church fill up with people watching the sunset, chatting, and drinking. There are usually lots of buskers here too making it one of the best places in the city to soak up the city in the evening. Where to Eat in Paris I have eaten in so many places in Paris. My Google maps is just filled with saved restaurants and bars! Here's a list of a few places to get you started: Café Père & Fils -- Café Père & Fils is a Parisian brasserie and coffee shop with outdoor seating for lunch and drinks. Florence Kahn -- This perfect little shop has a blue mosaic shopfront. They make really delicious sandwiches -- try the pastrami. ISTR -- ISTR is extremely trendy and usually busy for dinner, but I highly recommend its happy hour, when the wine and oysters are cheap. King Falafel Place -- Some of the best falafel in Paris. There's usually a line but it moves quickly. La Crêperie des Artes -- This tiny to-go crêperie is the best in all of Paris (in my opinion). Cheap, delicious, and large portions -- you can't go wrong here. Le Dit Vin -- The prices are reasonable, there is a large wine selection, and the menu changes daily depending on what's fresh. It's one of my absolute favorite spots in the city Pizzeria Popolare -- Some of the best pizza in Paris. Get there early. The line is LONG. Juveniles -- An awesome bistro near the Louvre with a rotating menu in a compact space. Robert et Louise -- This place serves lots of meat and roasts from an open fire. It's a hearty meal. Great wine selection too!

How to Spend 3 Perfect Days in Paris: A First Timers Guide and Itinerary Where to Stay in Paris If this is your first trip to Paris, one of the biggest questions you probably have is where to stay in Paris. Paris isn't THAT big, but the main sights are sort of spread out, so it's important to be somewhat central if you only have 3 days in Paris. The city of Paris is organized into 20 Arrondissements (otherwise known as neighborhoods). They are ordered from 1-20 and spiralize around the city - check out the map below to see what I mean! If this is your first visit to Paris, I highly recommend staying in either the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh arrondissement to be as central as possible. These are the neighborhoods that surround the main sites like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Notre Dame, etc. When looking at hotels, I highly recommend picking one that is within walking distance of a Metro Station. I'll talk about it more in the next section, but public transportation in Paris is exceptional and will save you tons of money versus taking cabs everywhere. So, it's extremely convenient to be close to a train station! In terms of hotel options, there is truly something for everyone in Paris, from hostels to luxury stays and everything in between. Don't stress about finding the \"perfect\" hotel, unless you have something very specific in mind. For example, if you NEED a balcony with a view of the Eiffel Tower, you will have to do some researching! But if you're not super picky, you will have tons of options in Paris. The important thing is to pick a hotel within your budget, near a Metro station, and in a central neighborhood. Beyond that, don't stress too much.

Don't be intimated by it, even if you can't speak French. RATP (Régie Autonome des Transport Parisiens) is the name of the entire system, which includes trains, the metro, trams, and buses. I highly recommend downloading Google Maps for your trip, which has all the public transportation schedules built in. Just enter your location and where you need to go, and it'll show you the different options for getting there, including the easiest and the fastest. You can also purchase the Paris Visite pass for your trip, which is. A card you can pre-load that includes all public transportation within the city limits. We didn't bother with this since we were only there for 2 days, but you can read more about it here ! No matter what pass you decide on, just know taking public transportation will save you a lot of money ! If you rely solely on taxis in Paris, you will end up spending a ton of money and wasting time, so take advantage of the public transportation! For example, we were trying to get from the Arc de Triomphe to our Seine River cruise. The metro station was nearby but we would've had to walk pretty far to get to the Seine River Cruise. I found some free Wi-Fi and plugged in our current location and where were trying to go on Google Maps, and sure enough, there was a bus line right next to us that went straight to our destination! We already had RATP tickets which can be used on the bus, tram, or Metro, so all we had to do was hop on and insert our ticket! It was so easy and saved us tons of time and money.

It gets you entrance into over 35 tourist attractions in Paris, including the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, and more. There are different passes depending on the duration of your trip (1-day, 2-day, etc.). The Paris Pass also allows you to skip the normal line at most attractions and/or get early entry. But make sure to do your research and confirm if it's worth purchasing! We didn't end up getting it because a 2-day pass was about $140/day and the total for the sites we wanted to visit was less than that! Day 1: The Louvre, Gardens, Arc de Triomphe & A Dinner Cruise Visiting the Louvre Today is your first day in the City of Lights, and it is an action-packed one!! Start the day with a pastry and cappuccino from whatever café you stumble upon (there is literally one on almost every corner!). Make sure to say \"Bonjour\" and \"Merci\", but bonus points if you can order in French. Then it is time to head to the Louvre! ! Even if you don't like museums, the Louvre is just one of those things you have to do. I mean, you can't spend 3 days in Paris and NOT see the Mona Lisa, right? Make sure to reserve your tickets for the Louvre in advance. If you're visiting in the summer, I recommend booking at least a month or two in advance so you can get a morning time slot. This goes for pretty much every major site in Paris. At most places, like the Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe, there is a line for people with tickets and a line for people without tickets, and the one for people who don't have tickets is always INSANE. So, be proactive and buy in advance. Another Pro Tip: There's really no need to wait in the long line for the Mona Lisa unless you ABSOLUTELY have to have a perfect picture right in front of it! Just walk to the left or right of the line and you will still be able to see it! Do NOT wait until you get to Paris to purchase tickets. Grab your Louvre tickets now and get the time slot you want! Wander on Foot After you're done at the Louvre, follow the exit signs for the Jardin de Tuileries. This is a gorgeous garden right outside the grounds of the Louvre! You can grab a quick bite to eat from one of the vendors in the park, or venture a few blocks away to a local café. If the weather is nice, spend some time exploring the garden! From there, you can also walk around the River Seine and see some of the famous bridges like Pont Alexandre III, Pont des Arts, and Pont Neuf. As you make your way back towards Pont des Arts and Pont Neuf, you'll discover the famous Île de la Cité, which translates to the Island in the Seine. This is where the Notre Dame Cathedral and the Sainte-Chapelle church are located! Spend some time admiring both churches and taking in the views from the Île de la Cité. Whether choose to go inside one, both, or neither, that's up to you! It's a quick 3 minute walk between the two. Visiting the Arc de Triomphe Once you've had your fill of churches and bridges, head back to your hotel and change for the evening. Tonight you are embarking on a dinner cruise along the Seine, so I recommend dressing up a little. However, before the dinner cruise, you will be heading to another famous site: the Arc de Triomphe ! You can absolutely just go and see it from the ground, but I highly recommend going to the top!! I didn't even realize this was possible until recently, but it was one of my favorite parts from our trip this past summer. Going to the top costs about ~ 15 euros, and I recommend buying tickets in advance. (It is covered by the Paris Pass if you decide to go that route!) When you book online, you will select a time to visit - they have slots in 15-minute increments. For this itinerary, I recommend booking at slot about 2 hours before your dinner cruise (this will vary depending on the time of year!). GREAT TO KNOW: The Arc De Triomphe is in the middle of a major intersection at the end of the famous Champs-Élysées street! To get to the monument, you actually have to go underground through a tunnel! We spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out how to cross through the crazy traffic before asking a policeman how to get across... he pointed to the signs for the tunnel (stupid American moment!) When you get through the tunnel, you might see a HUGE line.. if you already have a ticket keep walking to the front and up the little stairs until you're outside. There should be a separate (and much shorter) line for people with advanced reservations. This is you. You're welcome. We only waited about 5 minutes to start climbing the stairs!! There are elevators but I believe they are reserved for those who are physically incapable of climbing, have small children, etc. Once you finish the climb, you will be rewarded with epic views of the entire city, including the Eiffel Tower! Spend some time walking around and taking it all in - there is a lot to see! You can also learn more about the history of the Arc de Triomphe inside - did you know it was built to honor those who fought and died in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars? DON'T WAIT! Grab your ticket to the Arc de Triomphe NOW in order to skip the long lines and get the time slot you want! Dinner Cruise Along the Seine After you're finished at the Arc de Triomphe, it's time to make your way towards the river for your dinner cruise! If your cruise leaves from Pont de l'Alma Bridge, you can hop right on the #92 bus to the Alma - Marceau stop! We booked our dinner cruise through Bateaux Mouches, and I highly recommend them!! They operate a few different dinner cruises, but I highly recommend the Romantic Dinner Cruise that leaves later in the evening. We almost booked the \"early bird\" one because it was much cheaper, but then I realized how late the sun sets in the summer in Paris! Our boat left around 8pm, and the sunset was around 9pm. Trust me, you don't want to miss the sunset from the boat!! To start, they give you a little card that shows all the historic sites you will see along the way. The boat cruises along the Seine, first south towards Notre Dame and the Louvre. Then, you'll get to see the sunset from the river and get the fabulous golden hour lighting, but that's not even the highlight! The boat is timed perfectly so that you are right in front of the Eiffel Tower when the lights turn on at dusk, followed shortly after by its first sparkling light show on the hour. We took our drinks and went to the roof at this point and got to watch the Eiffel Tower sparkle right in front of our eyes. It was seriously magical. You can read more about different cruises available and which is the best option for you in my full Paris Dinner Cruises Guide here ! The boat docks back around 10:30pm-11:00pm. If you still have energy, I highly recommend strolling towards the Eiffel Tower along the Seine. This area completely comes alive at night, and you can catch a few more sparkling shows! If you make it until 1am, you're rewarded with a unique viewing where all the lights on the Tower turn off and the entire thing is covered in sparkles!! A sight not to miss! Day 2: Day trip Outside the City + Dinner show If you have 3 days in Paris, I highly recommend spending a half day getting out of the city and visiting one of the many famous sites right outside! We chose Versailles, which is what I will dive into in this itinerary. However, here are some other awesome options for day trips outside of Paris ! 1. GIVERNY, WHERE MONET LIVED AND PAINTED 2. CHAMPAGNE, NEED I SAY MORE? 3. NORMANDY, IF YOU LIKE HISTORY 4. BRUGES, THE VENICE OF BELGIUM! 5. MONT SAINT-MICHEL, AN INCREDIBLE ISLAND VILLAGE Day Trip to Versailles Versailles is another famous site that you absolutely need to reserve tickets for in advance ! Again, I highly recommend looking at least a month before your trip. You will need to select a time slot for entry - I recommend grabbing the earliest option so you can avoid the crowds and crazy lines. We booked our tickets very close to our trip and got an 11am time slot, and the lines were already crazy by the time we arrived. So.. the earlier the better! Getting to Versailles is actually very easy, even for tourists! To get there, you can take one of the \"RER\" trains. These are basically commuter trains that run from the middle of Paris to the outskirts. The RER C train (yellow line) runs directly from Paris to Versailles, which makes it impossible to mess up! You can get on the RER C train from multiple different spots throughout Paris, like the Champ de Mars station next to the Eiffel Tower or the Saint-Michel Notre Dame station! You can read my full guide on taking a Day Trip from Paris to Versailles to learn more about transportation options, ticket options, and how to spend your day! Once you arrive at the Versailles Train Station (River-Gauche), just follow the crowds! Nearly everyone will be headed to the same place. There is a small little town outside the palace with shops to grab breakfast at as well. We found some delicious crepes here before heading inside! Between the gardens and the palace, Versailles can easily fill your entire day. Below is a map of Versailles so you can get a feel for all there is (it's not just a palace!) The grounds are absolutely massive. Some top things to see include the inside of the Palace (based on your timed-entry), Marie Antoinette's estate, and the vibrant gardens. If I could go back and do it again, I think I would book an organized tour of Versailles since there is SO much to see and do here. We kind of wandered around and definitely weren't as prepared as we should've been!! Guided tours are also a great way to skip the lines! Another great option is to rent bikes at Versailles. The grounds are MASSIVE (part of the reason it's impossible to do it all in one day), so bikes allow you to get around faster and see more! You can also book a guided bike tour of Versailles - best of both worlds! Dinner Show in the City Once you're finished at Versailles, it's time to head back into the city for another evening of fun! If you want to eat dinner before heading back to Paris, there are some great restaurants right outside the palace. We ate at Le Saint Claire and it was yummy! Once you're back in the city, I recommend spending the evening bar hopping in the Latin Quarter. This is a super fun neighborhood with different cocktail and wine bars. Or if you are looking for something more exciting, you can't go wrong with seeing a burlesque show like Moulin Rouge, Lido or Crazy Horse! Because what's more iconic than seeing a French cabaret show in Paris?! Make sure to check out my list of 19 things to do in Paris at night for even more ideas! Day 3: Montmartre & Picnic at the Eiffel Tower Exploring Montmartre Today is your last day in Paris, and I recommend heading to the quaint little neighborhood of Montmartre. If you went to the top of the Arc de Triomphe, you probably saw the most famous Montmartre landmark, the Sacré-Coeur Basilica. It stands out high on a hill above Paris, and it is totally worth a visit! In addition to the Basilica, you'll find adorable cobblestone streets and fabulous eateries in Montmartre. It's the perfect place to spend your morning wandering around, and it actually feels totally different from the rest of Paris. If you're looking for something fun to do in Montmartre, consider booking this Montmartre Food Walking Tour ! On this 3 hour tour, you'll get to experience the best of Paris's culinary delights, everything from crepes, cheese, cured meats to wine and macarons! Sounds like heaven to me!! Book it here! Picnic at the Champs de Mars Once you've had your fill of Montmartre, head back into the city center and spend time exploring any other areas that you missed!This is the perfect time to explore some Paris hidden gems like Place des Vosges or Parc de Belleville. And to finish your last day in Paris, of course we are going to spend the evening at the Eiffel Tower! First, head to the nearest market or grocery store and pick up some fruit, cheese, bread, wine, and whatever else tickles your fancy!! Bring a blanket or kimono from home so you don't have to buy one, then make your way to the Champs de Mars! The Champs de Mars is a large grassy area right in front of the Eiffel Tower where people sit and picnic (it's linked on the map at the beginning of this post!). Find an empty spot on the lawn and enjoy! I recommend trying to arrive around an hour before sunset so you can see all the different views of the Eiffel Tower. First at golden hour right before sunset, then the sunset itself, then blue hour, then darkness!! They are all magic in their own way. Note: The sunset time will depend on what time of year you are visiting! When we were visiting in late May, the sunset wasn't until 9:45pm!! And of course the Eiffel Tower will change too. Around dusk, the Eiffel Tower automatically lights up with golden lighting. Then, on the first hour after dusk (9:00pm, 10:00pm, etc.) the Tower sparkles for 5 minutes. It is pure magic. That view will be totally different from the one an hour later, as the next one will be completely dark outside!! So I highly recommend staying for a few hours so you get all of the experiences!! There really is no better way to end your 3 days in Paris then to watch the Eiffel Tower sparkle. Final Thoughts Well that wraps up my 3 Day itinerary for Paris! I hope this guide helped you plan your trip. In my opinion, 3 days in Paris is the perfect amount of time to see the best parts of the city. If you only have 2 days, I would cut out the trip to Versailles and focus on the main parts of the city!! And if you only have one day, that is not enough and you need to extend your trip!

However, it's also worth remembering that Paris is a BIG city - something we'll reiterate multiple times throughout the guide below - not some fairytale small town. Mismatched expectations - the contrast between the idea that Paris is some romantic riverfront village and the reality that it's a massive city - is what we think is at the core of the \"Parisians are cold and rude\" sentiment that you've almost certainly heard from someone in your life (usually someone that hasn't been to Paris in a while). In our experience, which is based on three trips (spanning just under a month) in the past three years - with the most recent in November 2024 - that stereotype is simply not true anymore. Are Parisians particular about greeting with \"bonjour\" before getting down to business (e. G. ordering coffee)? Yep. And as long as you know those nuances going in, you're going to have a great time (which is exactly what this guide is for!). We absolutely love Paris, and we're pretty sure you will too (especially if you're armed with this guide). We have put all of our tips, tricks, and discoveries into this guide to help you plan an amazing trip, especially if it's your first time. In this guide to planning your trip to Paris, you'll find a detailed 4 day Paris itinerary, complete with things to do, see, eat, and drink, along with the important details you need to know like how to see the Eiffel Tower and the best way to tackle the beast that is the Louvre. You'll also find logistics - like how to get around and some useful tips and tricks for visiting Paris - that are important for planning your trip. We hope you enjoy this guide, that you find it helpful for planning your trip, and we help you discover something new and exciting, whether it's your first time, or tenth. Sound good to you?

The biggest realization from my recent trip is that Paris is somehow simultaneously massive and compact. Let me explain. If you look at it on a map, the area that you're going to be spending your time in as a visitor is relatively small when you think about it as a piece of the broader city (it's basically just the part of the city that's along the river, with a few deviations to places like Montmartre). However, Paris is a BIG city, and even that little chunk of the city is pretty big - it takes an hour and a half to walk from the Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Bastille (which is roughly the furthest west/east you're going to go). And that doesn't take into account the fact that the city is PACKED with things to do, see, eat, and drink. The point is, we think that four days is the absolute minimum you should spend in Paris. Anything less will have you jetting around from sight to sight with no time to relax and experience what truly makes Paris special. A long, wine-filled lunch. The cobblestone streets in Montmartre. Wandering Le Marais. Relaxing on the banks of the Seine or under the Eiffel Tower. With four days, you'll comfortably be able to fit in the two big museums (the Louvre and Musée d'Orsay), the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe, and a day trip to Versailles. This itinerary is meant to help you see the best of the city without needing a vacation from your vacation. If you have more time, we have recommendations below in the \"more time\" section on how to spend it. However, you could also just pick a neighborhood and spend a day wandering from shop to shop, coffee to coffee, wine bar to wine bar. That sounds like a perfect day in Paris to us. Where to Stay in Paris The first thing you need to know here is that there are a nearly unlimited number of places you could stay in Paris. Paris is divided into neighborhoods called arrondissements - each has its own history and personality. If you look at the city map, imagine a snail's shell coming out from the very center and circling clockwise and you'll get the logic behind the numbers. We have an entire guide dedicated to choosing a place to stay in Paris, which you should read for far more detail than we have in this summary. Here's a quick summary of that guide if you're short on time (though we'd recommend reading the section of the place you end up staying for tips and places to add to your list!). If it's your first time in Paris, our recommendation is that you stay in Le Marais, the heart of medieval Paris. This is Paris at its best, we think, and it's about as central as it gets. You have excellent walkability to basically every main site in Paris, the best transit connections in the city (including to the airport), and many of Paris' best places to eat, drink, and shop right outside your front door. Plus, a bunch of hotels (though, as you might imagine, it's not cheap!). In Le Marais, stay at the (relatively) affordable Hôtel National Des Arts et Métiers, or Hôtel Jules & Jim if you're looking for one of the best hotels in Paris. If you're looking for a cool neighborhood with lots of food and drinks, stay in the 2nd Arrondissement, a new personal favorite after one of our recent trips. If we were moving to Paris, we'd move to Sentier, a slice of the 2nd near all of our favorites in the neighborhood. The 2nd is adjacent to Le Marais, and offers many of the same benefits with a slightly lower price tag (generally speaking). Stay at Le 123 Sébastopol, which might just be the best value in the entire city of Paris, or at CitizenM Opéra (CitizenM is one of our favorite hotel chains in the world, and we've stayed at multiple locations across multiple countries - highly recommend!). If you're on a budget and looking for a blend of affordability and convenience, stay in the 9th Arrondissement, which is central and affordable with great nightlife. For what it's worth, we stayed in the 9th on two recent trips (first at the super affordable Hotel Joyce, then at the excellent Maison Mère), and it was a great home base for exploring the city. Plus, a bunch of our favorite wine bars / coffee shops / restaurants in Paris turned out to be in the 9th (or on the border), which is another major pro for staying here. If you're looking for a romantic getaway, you should absolutely stay in Montmartre (the 18th Arr.), where you'll find cobblestone streets and a former village - home to many of the most famous artists in history like Van Gogh, Renoir, and Picasso - on a hill above Paris that has since been swallowed up by the ever-expanding city. It has all the charm of a medieval village straight out of a fairy tale, but the location up on the hill is a little further out than some people might prefer (especially if it's a shorter trip). I splurged at Terrass on my latest trip in one of their Eiffel Tower view rooms, and it was MAGICAL (but not cheap). For a more budget-friendly option, look at Hôtel Monsieur Aristide or Hôtel des Arts Montmartre. The view from my room at Terrass in Montmartre! Read More: Where to Stay in Paris (Complete Guide for First Timers) Important Tips for Visiting Paris During your trip to Paris, you'll come across some of the clichés about Parisians, as well as some specific French lifestyle elements that are worth knowing about. Set Your Expectations Here's the thing about Paris. Paris is very, very polarizing. Some people rave about it and can't get enough of it. Some people come back from their first trip to Paris and say it was underwhelming and that French people are surly and mean. I think it all comes down to expectations. Paris is not a city in a fairytale, which I think is what many first-time visitors build it up to be. They have this romantic ideal in their head, where they're strolling by the Seine with a red beret on their head, hand in hand with their lover on their way to a cozy bistro for dinner. While that can certainly exist in Paris, it's leaving out the part where there are cars honking, you just stepped in dog poop and are frantically trying to wipe it off on a leaf or the curb, and you're running late because the metro was delayed. The romantic ideal of Paris is forgetting that Paris is a real city, a city full of tourists, and a big city, which means it has its fair share of problems. It's a little dirty (not as clean as Seville or Madrid, not as dirty as Rome), it's a little crowded (especially on the metro at peak times), and it's true that sometimes, Parisians can come off as unfriendly. But on the other hand, it's also an amazing city full of world-class art museums, a pretty great food scene, romantic neighborhoods full of narrow cobblestone streets like Montmartre, and tons of history and culture to dive into and learn more about. If there are two things I want you to know before you go to Paris, it's these two. First, remember that Paris is a real city, and that the people living there are real people. There are great things about Paris, and there are annoying things about Paris. We'll do our best to help you see the great things and minimize the annoying things. Or at least be aware of them going in. Second, don't try to fit it all in. Trust me, I've done that trip. I've run around from museum to museum, and seen it all, but absorbed almost none of it. Instead, focus on a couple of main attractions (we think they're the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Musée d'Orsay, and the Rodin Museum) and save some time to connect with locals on a walking tour, food tour, or cooking class to learn more about what makes Paris tick. Learn Some French - A Little Goes a Long Way! Don't be put off by the myth that Parisians are rude and unaccommodating to tourists. Generally speaking, it's an outdated idea, and it usually comes from someone who hasn't been to Paris in a decade or two. The reality is that it basically comes down to a mismatch of expectations (again) around manners. Specifically, greetings. You need to make sure to greet everyone before you get into the interaction! For example, saying bonjour before ordering coffee from a barista. As long as you greet everyone with a smile and a Bonjour - which is perhaps the most important part! - and make sure to be polite, most locals we've encountered have been absolutely lovely. It will help if you learn a few important French phrases. In our experience, people are always happier when you make an effort to use their own language. Not just in France, but just about everywhere in the world. Here are some useful phrases to learn, and my attempt at phonetic spelling. Bonjour (bone - jure) - hello / good day S'il vous plaît (seal voo play) - please (\"if you please\", literally) Merci (mare - see) - thank you Je voudrais (jeuh voo - dray) - I would like (this is the polite way of saying it, I think) Pardon - (par - do) - excuse me Excusez-moi (excuse - ay mwah) - excuse me (different way to say it) Désolée (dez - oh - lay) - sorry Here's a more comprehensive guide to French phrases to learn, or you could pick up a small French phrasebook to help you learn French as you go. The Crowds Are Going to Be Intense (There's No Real \"Low\" Season) After a recent trip to Paris in November, I talked to multiple guides, restaurant owners, and baristas, and they all said some version of the same thing: \"there is no low or shoulder season anymore.\" This is true of most of the main cities in Europe, and certainly applies to Paris: the age of shoulder seasons that have meaningfully lower crowds is a thing of the past. However, the one thing I would say is that the makeup of the crowds changes by the season (for example, you see more kids and families in the spring and summer, and more young people and retirees in the fall). I wouldn't expect to show up in Paris at any time and find it quiet (except, ironically, during the Olympics, which almost every Parisian I talked to said was relatively quiet, in a bad way for tourist-centric businesses). My point is that there is no time when you can visit the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, or the Arc de Triomphe and have them to yourself. It's just not going to happen. Even in November, the lines to access the Louvre were wild (though less wild than, say, July). I talked to multiple people in the tourist industry, and generally the lowest seasons are November (when it's likely to be gray and drizzly, which I can personally confirm) and January/February (when it's more likely to be colder, but you also tend to get more blue skies). March to October (and December for Christmas)? Busy busy busy. Now, here are three things you can do to avoid crowds, to the extent that it is possible. Walk around key spots - like Montmartre or along the Seine - before 8am or after 10pm (ish) Pre-book main attractions to avoid missing out on experiences. Book tours that offer off peak times (early morning or night tours) Book Your Big Attractions in Advance One thing that can be confusing, especially if it's your first time in Paris or in a big European city, is that there are often two separate lines at most main tourist attractions: the line for the ticket office, and the line for security. A pro-tip here is that you can completely bypass the line for the ticket office at most major tourist attractions by booking a timed entry slot in advance. However, there are two considerations to keep in mind here. One, booking in advance obviously means you're sacrificing flexibility, which may or may not be something you care about. But think about it this way: by booking a Louvre timeslot in advance, you're likely saving yourself a couple of hours of waiting in line at the ticket office. Which seems worth it if your time is limited! This is really only important when it's weather-related, I think. You might not want to go to Versailles on a gray, rainy day if you know it might be sunny on a different day. Two, some popular attractions - like the Louvre and Musée d'Orsay - have a limited number of slots available on a given day, and they will sell out online in advance. If that's the case for your dates, then you have two options: book a tour that includes entry, or show up on the day of and wait in line at the ticket office (they usually have tickets set aside for walk up, but the lines can be long). Here are the attractions I would put in that \"book in advance\" category: The Louvre Musée d'Orsay The Arc de Triomphe Notre Dame The Orangerie The Picasso Museum Sainte Chappelle Other attractions, like the Pantheon or Rodin Museum, can generally be booked online a few days in advance (which will save you time by avoiding the ticket office line), or on the day of. Other Things to Know About Visiting Paris Here are some other things to know going in that we jotted down on our latest trip. Some are useful, some are funny, some are good to know, and we hope that all of them will help you have a more enjoyable trip. Many shops and convenience stores are closed on Sundays so check hours in advance. Even grocery stores and other places you'd expect to be open if you're coming from the US or Canada. Similarly, museums and places of interest typically have a day a week when they're closed, but it's not always the same. Check before you go. Paris is MASSIVE. We spent the first day or two trying to walk everywhere, and after multiple 30,000 step days decided to use the metro. With limited time, get acquainted with the metro and bus system, which will allow you to get around much more efficiently. We used this app for navigating the metro. It's well worth investing in a Visite Pass, which gives you unlimited bus and metro rides (you only need zones 1-3, really). You're still going to be doing a lot of walking on this itinerary, and you'll need to watch where you step because there is dog poop everywhere. Wear comfortable shoes, and leave the heels at home. There's a lot of cobblestones and uneven footing in Paris, and if you're doing a lot of walking, you'll want your feet to be comfortable. Everybody in Paris smokes. Or it seems that way to us. It has to be at least 50% of adults. Anytime you're eating or drinking outside, there is almost guaranteed to be someone smoking nearby. Good to know going in. Tipping isn't as much of a thing. Servers in Paris get paid a living wage - something we should probably consider in the US (don't @ me with \"but small businesses\") - and tipping is more about rewarding good service than a requirement so the server can pay rent. It's still nice to give a 5-10% tip at sit-down restaurants with good service, and you won't get a receipt with a tip line - either tip in cash, or tell them the final amount you want to pay before they run your card (e. G. if the bill is 50 Euros and you want to tip 5, tell them \"55 Euros, s'il vous plaît\"). Read More: Essential Paris Travel Tips for First Timers (coming soon) 4 Days in Paris: A Perfect Itinerary for First Timers And now, let's get into the meat of this itinerary. We have a secret for you. And it's a lesson that it took us years of traveling to finally learn on our three month European extravaganza a few years ago. Travel is better - and by better, we mean more rewarding, interesting, and fun - when you try your best to connect with locals to see the place through their eyes. I (Matt here!) took that to heart on my last visit to Paris in an effort to better understand what makes the city special, and came away with a much richer understanding of Paris' unique culture and point of view on life. Particularly on that latest trip, I did a bunch of different tours and experiences (I've included the ones that I thought were particularly special in the guide below) that opened my eyes to a new side of the city, culture, and people. Our biggest tip for Paris (or any city, really) is to prioritize tours that connect you with locals and allow you to get a unique perspective on the city (which is what you're going to see in this itinerary). In terms of structure, we always do our best to anchor the days in our itineraries around a main experience, with time on either side for things like coffee, cocktails, and good old fashioned wandering around a neighborhood. And we never, ever do multiple museums in a single day. Trust us and learn from our mistakes - you WILL be exhausted by the time you get to the second one, and will get a lot less out of it. With so much to experience in Paris, it's definitely tempting to try to pack in all the sights, but then you'll find you don't have much time to \"live like a Parisian\". And that would be a shame. To make the most out of Paris, plan to do one or two major sights a day, and dedicate the rest to walking around the neighborhoods while leaving yourself energy to go out for a drink and some dancing or live entertainment in the evenings. What to Book in Advance: In general, to make sure you're actually able to make it to some of the top sights in Paris, we'd recommend booking 2-3 months in advance for the Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, the Eiffel Tower (if you want to go to the top), and Versailles. This is particularly important if you're visiting over the summer, when we've seen crazy lines for some of Paris' top sights, and it's less important in the off-season (though we'd still book the Louvre in advance). Here's an overview of the 4 day itinerary you'll find below: Day 1: The Left Bank, Saint-Germain, and the Eiffel Tower Day 2: Gothic Churches, the Louvre, and the Arc de Triomphe Day 3: The Coolest Neighborhoods in Paris and a Foodie Experience Day 4: A Day Trip to Versailles Below the detailed itinerary, you'll find some suggestions on what to do with more or less time on your trip to Paris, including options for compressing this itinerary into one, two, or three days. A few things to note about the itinerary we're about to get into. We believe pretty strongly that you should skip going to the top of the Eiffel Tower, and have a few different places where you can get a better (we think) view of Paris for far less hassle. Instead, picnic at the base and walk across the river to Trocadero for nice views of the tower. We also believe that the Champs-Élysées, while a beautiful wide boulevard that is emblematic of Paris, is just about the least \"Parisian\" place imaginable. It's full of multinational chains that you could find in literally any big European city. Don't spend more than 30 minutes on the Champs-Élysées. The Arc de Triomphe, however, is great! Many museums and attractions have a day that they are closed (for example, the Louvre is closed on Tuesdays), so plan accordingly. Many museums have a night where they are open late, which allows for locals to enjoy them after work. This is a great time to visit, but it depends on what else you have going on in your itinerary. Another note here at the top: This itinerary is jam-packed! There's a ton to do and see (and eat, and drink) in Paris, and fitting it all into four days is impossible. To that end, we've made some hard choices (like the choice not to bother going up the Eiffel Tower) that are based on our own experiences in Paris in an effort to help you maximize your time and enjoyment. One of those choices is to include Versailles in the itinerary, rather than in the \"more time\" section. To be honest, we could go either way. We'd prefer adding Versailles only if you have five days or more, but we think you can fit it into four if you're willing to skip some other things, like a walking tour about the French revolution or a visit to an additional museum. Last, but certainly not least, we're not going to give specific recommendations on places to eat for two reasons. One, Matt has Celiac Disease and French food is absolutely TERRIBLE if you need to eat gluten free (there's flour or bread in everything!), so we're not really the right people to give that advice (except for the best gluten free restaurants in Paris, which we have plenty of opinions about). Two, it depends so much on your tastes and budget. So we'll let you figure that out on your own, for the most part. Day 1: Exploring the Left Bank On your first full day in Paris, we'd skip the Louvre (save it for a day when you're less jetlagged) and get oriented to the city by exploring the \"Left Bank\" of the Seine, which refers to the south side of the river (and is a very common way that you'll hear people talk about Paris). A quick side note on the two banks. The names, which can be confusing if you don't know this already, are derived from which side of the river they're on if you're looking downriver (or, put another way, in the direction that the river flows). The Seine flows through Paris from east to west, so if you're looking west down the river, the 5th, 6th, and 7th Arrondissements are on the left side, while the 1st - 4th Arrondissements are on the right side. Historically speaking, the left bank has been known as the more creative, philosophical side of the river, where artists, writers, and revolutionaries hung out, while the right bank is the more aristocratic side, where the royal palace and the associated court was located. Today, that stereotype is less true than a couple hundred years ago, and we'd almost say that it's flipped if you look at the 6th and 7th Arr., where housing is basically occupied by rich foreigners at this point. Anyway, the first day is focused on the Left Bank, where you'll work your way from east to west, starting in the Latin Quarter (the 5th Arr.), hitting our favorite museum in Paris, and ending in the 7th Arr. at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. The Latin Quarter The Latin Quarter is our favorite part of Paris' Left Bank (at least of the arrondissements along the river). While the 6th and 7th feel very stuffy and, for lack of a better word, aristocratic, the 5th (which is the Latin Quarter) is a little more lived in. I stayed here on my latest trip for almost a week, and was surprised at how often I encountered people that actually lived in the neighborhood while I was out and about (which is certainly less true in just about every other arrondissement in the single digits). Having a neighborhood that is \"more local\" is a little bit of a stereotype, and I did some thinking while I was wandering around Paris solo about what this really means. To me, it means that people actually live there and so you have a range of businesses catering to those locals rather than a string of souvenir shops geared towards tourists with the exact same Eiffel Tower snowglobes that they imported from elsewhere. That means you're swapping those souvenir shops for a boulangerie, fromagerie, coffee shop, wine bar, bistro, and other places that I - and people like me - would actually want to hang out. Which is great! The 5th has that in droves, along with two key spots that you definitely shouldn't miss. The first, and your first stop on the trip, is the Jardin du Luxembourg, which is our personal favorite of the many green spaces in central Paris (and it was created in the 17th century!). We have been known to stop by a (gluten free) bakery nearby to pick up some pastries and head over to the gardens to bask in the warm sun, surrounded by greenery, fountains, sculptures, and people with a similar idea (including the old men playing Pétanque, which is kind of like bocce ball). Technically, it's in the 6th, but as you walk to the eastern side of the park you'll be in the perfect position to wander up towards your next stop. That next stop? The Panthéon. Which, unlike the Panthéon that you'll find in Rome, is not a pagan or Catholic religious site (it was at one point, but not today!), but is the burial site of \"great men,\" whatever that means. Originally, this was set to be a church, which is fairly obvious from the structure of the building from the outside. But as it was completed, the French Revolution had descended on Paris. One of the tenets of the French Revolution was breaking away from the Catholic Church as the ultimate power source (e. G. the divine right of kings), and so the church was rebranded into a mausoleum. Victor Hugo, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Voltaire are examples of said \"great men\" buried here. While the interior is cool, the real reason that the Panthéon is on this itinerary - and why it is specifically in the morning - is that the dome offers a great view out over the rest of Paris. And it's best in the morning, when the sun is at your back and not directly overhead or behind the Eiffel Tower in the distance. The Panthéon opens at 10am, so our recommendation is to take a nice morning walk through the gardens (maybe with a pastry and some coffee from a bakery nearby), and then walk up to Panthéon to be there around opening, when the light will be best for photos. You should know, however, that the dome of the Panthéon closes during the winter (I know because it closed a couple of days before I tried to go in mid-November!). We probably wouldn't go inside if this is the case, but it's up to you and your interests. There will be plenty of other church-like buildings on the rest of this itinerary. Another note: It's an extra few Euros to include the dome in your ticket. We'd do it, because the view from the dome is a big part of the reason it's on this itinerary. From there, make your way west through Saint-Germain, the 6th Arrondissement, out to the river for your next stop. A Crash Course in Impressionism at the Musée d'Orsay While the Louvre is the most impressive museum in Paris in terms of its size and scope, the award for our favorite museum in the city has to go to the Musée d'Orsay (although the Rodin Museum is a close second!). Now, we're definitely not saying that the Louvre isn't worth seeing (you'll find it on day two of this itinerary). But we ARE saying that it's a somewhat overwhelming and intimidating collection. And I just really love the impressionists, who were very much the bad boys (and a few ladies, too!) of the art world in their heyday. Funny enough, the two museums are very much related - the collection that lives at the Musée d'Orsay today was originally housed at the Louvre before it was moved here when the train station was decommissioned (the building used to be a train station before Paris outgrew it). I'm a sucker for landscapes and bright colors, which puts me right in the bullseye for the target audience of the Impressionists. I had been to the Musée d'Orsay twice before my most recent trip to Paris, but it had been a decade since my last visit and I felt like it was time to revisit what I remembered as my favorite museum in Paris. One of the biggest learnings about myself over the past few years of traveling is that I'm really bad at doing art museums by myself. I really need the context and storytelling to capture my interest and help me understand what exactly I'm looking at. Which is why I decided to do Carine's tour of the museum, which I had tried to set up on my previous solo trip to Paris, but our availability didn't overlap. Carine was GREAT. She studied art history at the École du Louvre, which seems like the perfect person to teach about Impressionism and its rise in France. Over a couple of hours, she weaved a story that truly captured my attention. She positioned the impressionists as the bad boys of their era who challenged norms and expectations in the Parisian art world, which was ruled by stuffy salons, to forge their own path and do what they wanted rather than what was expected of them. Important note: Her tour DOES NOT include a ticket, so you will have to book a timed entry ticket for the time of the tour (she'll give you more information on this). As you make your way through the museum, you'll get to enjoy some of the best impressionist art ever created. You'll feast your eyes on Cézanne, Degas, Monet, Van Gogh, and many others. If you visit on your own, make sure not to miss the Bal du Moulin de la Galette by Pierre-August Renoir with its energetic, lively atmosphere of a ball in Montmartre, Edouard Manet's quizzical Olympia, Vincent Van Gogh's Starry Night (if it's on display), and Claude Monet's Blue Water Lilies. Though my favorite discovery was Pissarro, whose use of color captured my eye from across the room. And the incredible use of light in Monet's early La Pie (The Magpie), which depicts a winter landscape with sunlight poking through the bare trees and dancing across the snowy landscape. If you don't do the tour with Carine, I highly recommend the audio guide to give you at least a little bit of the context and history. And book your tickets in advance to skip the ticket line! How to Visit: As usual with the main attractions in Paris, it's worth booking your visit in advance so that you can skip the ticket line (you'll still have to wait in the security line). Make your reservation here. The museum is closed on Mondays. If you want a quieter visit, go on Thursday evening, when the museum is open until 9:45pm. See the Eiffel Tower Up Close Look, if we're being completely honest, we don't really think you should go to the top of the Eiffel Tower. It reminds us a lot of the Space Needle in Matt's hometown of Seattle in the sense that it's expensive - in this case, both in terms of money and time - and it's missing a key element of the skyline...the Eiffel Tower! We have a couple of other suggestions for views of Paris that include the Eiffel Tower, and we would recommend skipping going to the top, instead focusing on the park at the base and the many views of the tower you can find from vantage points nearby. There are two things we think you should do at the Eiffel Tower that are completely free. The first is a picnic in the Champs de Mars, which is the park that's at the base of the tower. After the museum, stop by the best grocery store on the Left Bank - La Grande Épicerie de Paris ( here on Google Maps) - for some fresh bread, cheese and charcuterie, and perhaps a bottle of wine or some beer. Seriously, that grocery store is, yes, very fancy, but it's a JOY to shop in and discover some new, interesting foods to try. From there, it's a short walk to the Eiffel Tower. At the park at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, you'll find a huge group of people enjoying the view on warm sunny days in Paris. There's some great people watching to be had here, including the people selling buckets of booze who have an intricate system designed to help them evade the police, who show up every once in a while. This is probably in the top 3 in terms of experiences in Paris. The second thing we think you should do is walk over to the other side of the Seine, where you'll find two worthwhile spots with excellent views of the Eiffel Tower. First is the view from slightly above at the Jardins du Trocadéro ( here on Google Maps). Second is the view of the Eiffel tower from the water level from here. As you're walking around the Champs de Mars, be aware of your surroundings. Pickpockets are common in this part of the city, and you want to keep an eye on your belongings (no phones or wallets in back pockets, people!). The other thing to be aware of is the scams that are shell games and other informal gambling. As you're walking around, you're likely to see multiple iterations of this phenomenon, and you should know that the games are rigged against you, and that there are more people involved in the scam than you think (including many of the other players. In the grand scheme of things, we don't think you need to spend that much time at the Eiffel Tower itself, and you'd be better off spending your time elsewhere. We will say that it is worth seeing the light show that the Eiffel Tower puts on for five minutes at the top of every hour after dark (until 11pm, usually). The start times change with the season - obviously, there are more hours after dark in the winter than in the summer - and this is a good reference to read. You'll need to know what time the sun sets. We'd watch it from the platform at the Jardins du Trocadéro just across the river, and you'll want to be there a bit early to snag a spot. But what if you want to go to the top? Well, you have a few options to get to the top - you can take elevators to the second floor viewing deck or all the way to the top, or tackle it on foot up to the second floor platform, which involves more than 1,500 steps in total (and saves about 30% on tickets). You'll need to get tickets either way and we recommend booking tickets online to avoid huge lines at the ticket office. Be prepared for long security lines at basically all times - \"skip the line\" means you skip the ticket line, but everyone has to go through the security line. If you want to go all the way to the top, we'd book several weeks in advance because they do sell out. Dive into the World of French Wine (with Erwan) This is an important one for wine lovers. For a combination of many reasons, French wine just hits differently than wine from the new world. My somewhat educated opinion is that it's roughly equal parts centuries of farming and winemaking expertise and the fact that you're on vacation, so everything just tastes a little bit better. However, on my latest trip, I had a bit of a realization about wine in France. It has to do with how wine lists are organized differently than we're used to here in the U.S., and it means that many Americans on their first trip to Paris end up extremely confused when they sit down at their first dinner and try to order wine. The reason? There is not a single mention of wine varietals on a French wine list. In the U.S., when you go to order wine, you're generally ordering it by varietal, like Cabernet Sauvignon or Sauvignon Blanc. In France, things are organized by region and even city, without a single mention of what grape you're ordering. In fact, if you look at a typical French wine list, you will not see a single mention of a grape varietal. The reason is actually fairly simple (though I still think it would be helpful to know the grape varietals too!): The French believe in the concept of terroir. The idea that the soil, elevation, and climate of the place imparts inherent characteristics on the wine, and that a grape varietal grown in, say, Australia is going to taste different from the same varietal grown in France. The idea of place is the most important thing that creates the wine in the bottle, so that's what they lead with. However, if you're coming from our American paradigm and approach, it's extremely confusing, because how the heck am I supposed to know what the wine in Sancerre or Bourgogne is like? Well, you have to taste them! If you care about finding what kinds of French wine you like (and what you don't) and aren't already familiar with French wine, I highly recommend investing in a wine tasting experience where an expert walks you through the main wine regions in France, and guides you through a tasting of them. If you want to make sure to drink great wine during your trip, I'd highly recommend scheduling one of those experiences for your first night to set you up for success for the rest of your trip. I know this, because I did two on my latest trip, and despite being generally familiar with a couple of regions, I learned that I like wines from Sancerre (sauvignon blanc), other whites from the Loire Valley (like the chenin blanc from Saumur), and that I can get on board with reds from Languedoc. I did two tastings, and they turned out to be fairly different approaches to the same thing. The first was this tasting at a wine bar in the 1st, which was led by a sommelier and was a little more heavy on the educational piece (though still very interesting and engaging!). They also have an earlier time slot if you want a lunchtime wine extravaganza. The second was a wine and cheese tasting in the 7th with Erwan, which was much more casual and low key (and I really enjoyed Erwan's story and approach!). He pairs five wines with five French cheeses, all of which were excellent. I enjoyed both (and the wines were all great), and it comes down to what kind of approach you're looking for. For the purposes of this itinerary, though, I'd highly recommend Erwan's session because it is right near the Eiffel Tower, making it an easy addition to your first evening either before or after the tower (it depends on the time of year). Day 2: Île de la Cité and the Right Bank On your second day, when you'll ideally be a little more well rested, bright eyed, and bushy tailed, head to the right bank for an action-packed day. But First, Coffee The area near Île de la Cité is home to a couple of my favorite coffee shops in Paris, but Motors Coffee would be my top choice for starting your day off with good coffee and a delicious homemade pastry. It's a five minute walk or so to Notre Dame and Sainte-Chappelle, and they bring in some of the best coffees from around the world to brew at their compact shop on the border of Le Marais and the 1st Arrondissement. I came here multiple times on my latest trip to Paris, and I was sitting at the seat next to the stairs, where cinnamon and other baking spices were wafting up from the kitchen below. Grab a coffee, a pastry, and a seat on their terrace out front to set yourself up for an action-packed day ahead. Île de la Cité and a Tale of Two Churches The relatively small island in the middle of the Seine - which is a natural island, it isn't man made - is where you'll find two of Paris' best and most well known churches. One is the religious center of the city, and the other is the former royal chapel that, today, is my personal favorite church in the world (aside from la Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, which is a masterpiece). Notre Dame de Paris Let's start with the former - Notre Dame Cathedral - which is arguably one of the most famous churches in the world. Construction on Notre Dame began in the 12th century, and it has gone through several iterations to get to where it is today. It's an example of Gothic architecture (French Gothic, to be specific), and it's worth walking along the river on either side to see the grandeur of the building from the outside (and those beautiful flying buttresses!). Now, you might know that Notre Dame suffered a terrible fire in 2019 (you may remember all the social media posts showing their love for the church), and has been closed ever since as it was restored. I'm here in Paris in the weeks before it opens back up, and every local I've talked to has expressed excitement. It's a magnificent church, with great stained glass (though, sadly, it will be mostly replicas as a result of the fire), and I would recommend going up to the bell towers if you can for the views over Paris AND the excellent views of the gargoyles, which play an important role in the Disney masterpiece The Hunchback of Notre Dame (the song \"Hellfire\" is still a banger). How to Visit: Great news, it's FREE to visit Notre Dame and go inside. However, you will have to make a timed reservation, which will almost certainly be competitive. More information here. Sainte-Chapelle Until I revisited Sainte-Chapelle on this past visit to Paris, I forgot just how impressive the main chapel really is, with its 1,000+ colorful stained glass panels depicting scenes from the bible (don't miss the helpful visual guide that's inside the chapel, which will help you decode what you're looking at). What is Sainte-Chapelle, you ask? It's the Royal Chapel that sat within the Palais de la Cité, the medieval palace that resided on the island in the middle of the Seine for a few hundred years until the kings decided to move elsewhere (somewhere safer after a few close calls with rebellions, something the French love to do!). The most impressive part about the story of the Chapel, at least to me, is the fact that it went from an idea to finished in less than a decade (while Notre Dame, which is of course much bigger, took more than a century). It's a relatively quick visit - there's basically only one room to see here - but it's well worth braving the crowds, I think. I've done it three times now, and I will probably do it again in a few years. It's absolutely best on a sunny day around midday, when the sun reaches over the walls of the building surrounding the chapel and lights up the stained glass, but I was here on a dreary November morning when the chandeliers had to be lit because it was so dark, and I still enjoyed it. How to Visit: This one is not free, and I HIGHLY recommend making a timed entry reservation in advance (usually a week or two in advance is fine - it does sell out). Like many attractions in Paris, there are two lines to get into Sainte-Chapelle: the security line, and the ticket office line. By buying tickets in advance, you get to skip the second one, and you'll just have to line up for the security check (no big bags or luggage allowed, and nowhere to leave it). You can pay a few extra Euros for an audio guide, but I didn't think it was worth it here (and I usually love audio guides). Make your reservation here. Lunch and Coffee in the 1st After exploring the two churches, head over to the 1st Arrondissement, near the Louvre, for lunch and a little caffeine boost before you tackle the hefty museum that the district gets its name from. The reason to head here, specifically, for lunch is the fact that the area just north of the Louvre is known for its Japanese food, which I only realized and looked into after walking along Rue Sainte Anne ( here on Google Maps) on my way to the coffee shop below. I asked a guide about this, and he had a few recommendations in the area. First is Kintaro for ramen. Second is Udon Jube. Last is You. I need to eat gluten free, so Japanese food is very difficult, generally speaking. However, there's a 100% gluten free Japanese lunch spot called Cococo that I absolutely adore. For coffee, head straight to Télescope Cafe where you'll find a compact space and excellent coffee featuring coffee from Scandinavian roasters (mostly). Télescope is one of the OG specialty coffee shops in Paris - an oasis of light, bright coffees in a city where that was exceedingly rare a decade ago - and its location on a relatively quiet alley a short walk from the hustle and bustle of the Louvre only accentuates the \"oasis\" idea. I've been here many times now, and it was actually the first place that made me realize you could brew great coffee using an Aeropress. One other thing to note here: It's a very small space, and they have strict rules about laptops (no laptops), where you should sit, and about how many drinks you need to order (at least one per person) to maximize the amount of people they can serve. Also, they prefer cash under €5, and will add an upcharge for cards under that limit. The Louvre Before we get into the main part of this section, let's take a step back and talk about the Louvre as a tourist attraction. It might be the most famous tourist attraction in Paris (maybe second after the Eiffel Tower), but our feelings on the Louvre are slightly mixed. On one hand, this is one of the most impressive art collections on the planet, with an incredible breadth and depth of art - and by extension, important moments in art history - within its walls. On the other hand, it's a MASSIVE museum that would take days, if not weeks, to fully see. But as you likely already know, you don't have days or weeks, you have a portion of one day. Our recommendation is to spend no more than three to four hours in the Louvre. That gives you enough time to see the highlights (more on this in a second) and wander a bit, but doesn't have you spending a whole day inside the vast museum. Of course, this is all going to depend on your appetite for museums and how much of your precious time in Paris you want to spend wandering around the Louvre. If you want to spend a full day doing that, by all means go for it! You'll probably have to make a few cuts and changes to the rest of your itinerary. Now, let's talk about the museum itself. The building that the Louvre currently lives in was originally a military building (though it was called a palace) to protect Paris' western flank, and later became a royal palace. It was turned into a museum for the people during the French Revolution in the late 18th century, and has been open to the public ever since. In the basement of the Louvre you can actually still see the restored sections of the walls of the original building, which looks very much like the walls of a castle. The Louvre's collection is MASSIVE, with representation from basically every corner of the globe. The most famous is, of course, Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, but you should absolutely set your expectations when it comes to viewing her. The room where the (surprisingly small) painting lives is almost always unbearably crowded, with people essentially crowd surfing to get to the front to take their precious picture (what the heck are you even going to do with that picture? You're never going to look at it again!). Definitely be sure to look at the other paintings in that room, because there are some good ones at the backs of all the people trying to get a closer look at the Mona Lisa. Here are some other highlights that we would make sure not to miss: The Winged Victory (which is supposedly the inspiration for the famous Nike swoosh), the French paintings (like Liberty Leading the People and the Raft of Medusa, Crowning of Napoleon) and the iconic Venus de Milo. There are, of course, thousands of other \"highlights\" that we could list here, but those are the ones that stand out to us. A Note on Timing: The afternoon is generally the best time to visit the Louvre for slightly more manageable crowds. The late afternoon / early evening will give you a marginally more peaceful experience, which is why we've organized the itinerary in this particular way. Another important note: The museum is closed on Tuesdays, so plan accordingly. Make sure to review their bag policies (which you can find on their FAQ's) because big bags are not allowed in the museum. Visiting the Louvre on a Guided Tour On our three month European adventure that took us to Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Paris, we had the chance to see multiple famous art museums. We quickly realized that we're just not really art museum people. But after a tour of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, I had an epiphany as to why. Walking around an art museum and looking at pretty paintings is cool and all, but the real pleasure is when you actually understand the story behind each work of art, and the role they played in history and the progression of art history. Which, as two normal people, is something we don't really have in our repertoire. We highly, highly recommend investing in a guided tour of the Louvre. We've both done it independently - Matt multiple times - and have come to realize that unless you're an art historian, it's really, really hard to visit a huge art museum independently and come away with much else than \"well that was pretty\" or \"whoa, they have so much art!\" A guided tour with an art historian is going to give you the context and stories behind each work of art, which are the things that really bring the experience to life. Plus, arguably more importantly, they're going to help you understand the important pieces and periods to focus on. I, Matt, have now done the Louvre three times, twice without a guide and once with a guide, and my experience with a guide brought a level of richness and understanding that I absolutely would have never gotten on my own. If you've only got the time or budget for a single guided tour in Paris, this should be your choice. I (Matt again) recently did this tour of the Louvre at closing time with Walks - a company I've done six or seven tours in Europe with, and really loved it. You can read more about my experience here. I truly think this tour was worth the time and money for the multiple reasons I listed above. Visiting the Louvre Independently If a tour isn't in the budget (or doesn't fit with your timing), we have a few thoughts on how to maximize your time and pleasure at the Louvre. First, absolutely book your tickets well in advance for a timed entry slot, which will allow you to skip the ticket office line and head straight to the security line, which everyone has to wait in (but at least you don't have to wait in two long lines!). You'll want to book your tickets a few months in advance. You can book tickets here. Second, if you have pre-booked tickets, you can enter through a \"secret\" entrance (but how secret can it be if it's listed on the Louvre's website?) that sees far less crowds called \"Porte des Lions.\" You can find it here on Google Maps. This does mean that you don't go through the iconic entrance in the glass pyramid, but could literally save you an hour of your precious time. 2024/2025 Note: The entrance at Porte des Lions is temporarily closed in late 2024, with no timeline for reopening. We'd still skip the pyramid line and instead enter at Carrousel, here on Google Maps, which is a secondary entrance through a mall. Third, we'd recommend either an afternoon visit (2pm or so), or taking advantage of the late night openings (currently Wednesday and Friday at the time of writing), when the museum is open late (until 9pm) and the crowds are much, much thinner. It will require a bit of rearranging, but it will be well worth it. Last, we think the audio guide is worth it, and is a good alternative to a guided tour that will give you a little bit more context and history around the works of art you're looking at. Make sure to review their bag policies (which you can find on their FAQ's) because big bags are not allowed in the museum. A Post-Museum Walk Through the Gardens After a few hours at the Louvre, clear your head a little bit with a nice walk through the Tuileries with a couple of quick detours en route to the famous Champs-Élysées, the ultimate example of the grand Parisian boulevards of Napoleon III's dreams. The Champs-Élysées are pretty \"meh\" for us - it's lined with the exact same kinds of shops and stores you'd see anywhere else in the world, and it really isn't all that charming or interesting. If you want to go to a Zara, Five Guys, or an H&M, we'd do it at home and save your precious time in Paris for something else. Anyway, from the Louvre, walk west and you'll immediately be in the Tuileries, passing under one of two triumphal arches built by Napoleon that you'll see this afternoon (you'll go to the top of the second!). Here are our favorite stops on your walk along the Right Bank, which as you'll see was the home of the nobility and aristocracy in Paris for centuries. Take a detour out of the gardens to the Jardin du Palais Royal - another beautiful garden in the heart of the city, built around the 17 th century Royal Palace. A great place to stop and smell the roses (literally!). This is the palace that King Louis XIV abandoned (and gave to his little brother) when he moved out of the city to Versailles. Continue the detour over to Place de la Vendôme, where you'll find another Napoleonic relic in the center, surrounded by storefronts for many of the most famous French fashion brands in the world (Dior and Chanel have locations here, for example). The column in the center is dedicated to Napoleon, who is depicted as a Roman emperor at the top, and has depictions of many of his accomplishments winding around all the way to the top. Fun fact: it's made up of melted down cannons from the Austrians that Napoleon beat at Austerlitz, one of his most famous military victories in his illustrious military career. Head back out towards the rivers back to the Tuileries Gardens, where Parisians enjoy sitting on the lounge chairs by the fountains (there are pairs of lounge chairs that are welded together facing each other, which I thought was kind of cute) or taking walks with their friends. Cross it from the Louvre to the Place de la Concorde to end up in the wide square with the Obelisk (it is 3,300 years old and engraved with Egyptian hieroglyphics). Carrying on along the Seine you'll find the Grand Palais - built for the 1900 World's Fair, it is home to several exhibitions. Check out the amazing 8.5-ton art nouveau glass roof! Finish your walk on the Champs-Élysées, strolling towards the Arc de Triomphe. Here's a map of a route that hits the stops above. Climb the Arc de Triomphe Close out your day in Paris with a trip to the top of the Arc de Triomphe, which was built by Napoleon in the early 19 th century to commemorate a victory at Austerlitz. Napoleon LOVED his triumphal arches. A quick side note: If you're interested in Napoleonic history, I have a recommendation for you. At the beginning of our latest three month trip to Europe that took us to Spain, Portugal, and Italy, we heard Napoleon's name over and over, and to be honest, the only things I really knew about him were that he was short (which isn't true) and spoke French in a funny way (because he wasn't a native speaker - he was Corsican). So, to learn about the man who shaped modern Europe in many ways, I started listening to this podcast about Napoleon, and I love it. It's a deep dive into Napoleon's life and impact on Europe during his brief stint at the top. Now back to your regularly scheduled programming. Continue all the way up to the Place de l'Étoile, where you'll be looking up at the Arc from below. The Arc de Triomphe can be reached through an underpass from the northern side of the Champs-Élysées, bringing you to just underneath the arch. Go around sunset for soft golden light washing over the sprawling city, and stay for a bit when the lights come on, and you'll understand how Paris got the nickname \"City of Lights.\" This is hands down my favorite view in Paris, and I'd say it's a must-visit on just about every version of an itinerary. Particularly if you come around sunset and stay until the city lights up, which is what I did (although it's easier to do in November, when I was last in Paris, when the sun was setting around 5pm). You'll then climb 284 stairs en route to the terrace and viewing platform at the top (there are a couple of additional interior stops on the way up with information about the arc and its construction). From the terrace, you have a 360 degree view of Paris, including down the Champs-Élysées, towards the Eiffel Tower, and over towards Sacré-Cœur and Montmartre. It's a special view, and is well worth the price of admission (we think). How to Visit: Again, it's worth booking your visit in advance so that you can skip the ticket line (you'll still have to wait in the security line). Make your reservation here. You're going to have to climb a winding staircase (with 284 steps) to get up to the terrace with the views (there is an elevator, but it should only be used by people who need it). Along the way, there is an interior floor with a nice display about the history and construction of the Arc. Leave bags bigger than a small backpack at home, because they're not allowed. Day 3: Le Marais, A Foodie Adventure, and Montmartre On your third day in Paris, spend your time exploring two of our favorite neighborhoods in Paris - Le Marais and Montmartre - sandwiched around a food experience where you can dive deeper into French food culture. Explore Le Marais Le Marais, the 3rd and 4th Arrondissements, are just east of the Louvre, and are one of the few places in Paris where you can still find the narrow alleyways that existed prior to Napoleon III's leveling of 60% of the city to make way for the grand boulevards you see today. This is our favorite part of Paris, both to visit and to stay (it's our top recommendation in our guide to where to stay in Paris). In particular, we really enjoy the north end of the neighborhood - a little triangle bordered by Place de la République, Arts et Métiers, and Square du Temple - where you'll find several of our highlights listed below. This part of the city is a great place to eat, drink, and shop, and is worth a couple of hours of your time to absorb the architecture and vibes as you walk around and explore. Here are a few of our favorite spots in Le Marais. The Marché des Enfants Rouges: This is an open air market that is full of bars and restaurants and is packed full of people around lunchtime basically everyday. Is it firmly on the tourist radar? Absolutely. Does that mean you shouldn't go? Absolutely not. If you have the time, you should definitely swing by for lunch on one of your days in Paris. Kawa: This coffee is so good, I've ordered it to be shipped to me here in the States. Multiple times. Last time I was in Paris, I found myself here a couple of different times, and it didn't disappoint. If you're a coffee nerd, they have different coffee options prepared as either filter or espresso, along with a huge selection of both beans to take home, and brewing equipment. Place De La République: A bustling square with an important metro station and a big monument in the center. A corner turns into a skatepark in the afternoon, which makes for some really good people watching. Square du Temple - Elie Wiesel: We're big fans of this green space, which is a bit of an oasis in the middle of the most bustling part of the neighborhood. Place de Vosges: Another of our favorite green spaces in Paris, this one is right in the heart of all the action, and was planned in the 17th Century (and still has basically the same footprint today). Good fountain, good architecture on the perimeter, and Victor Hugo lived in a house on the square! Inside the Marché des Enfants Rouges Choose Your Own Foodie Adventure Diving into the food culture in places we're visiting is one of our favorite aspects of traveling, and we try to include a food tour, cooking class, or market tour in most places we visit. Unfortunately, the reality is that because Matt has Celiac Disease and can't have even a speck of gluten without being sick for days, a food tour or cooking class wasn't in the cards for us in Paris. HOWEVER. That does NOT mean it shouldn't be for you! We'd highly recommend it because it gives you a local's perspective on the city's food scene - what and where to eat and drink - and you get to connect with fellow travelers and try some amazing food. Here are some options for you, split between food tours and cooking classes. Our bias is to do a cooking class, because we LOVE to cook, but we also enjoy a good food tour. Option 1: Dive Into French Cuisine in a Cooking Class We've done all sorts of cooking classes around the world (read about our cooking class in Mexico City here), and while the gluten-filled nature of most French food made it nearly impossible to find one in Paris that meets our needs, that doesn't mean you shouldn't. After all, haven't you always wondered how to make the perfect croissant? Spoiler: you're probably not going to want to do it more than once. Here are a few cooking classes that would definitely be on our list if, you know, Matt could eat gluten. All three of them are baking classes - because Paris is known for pastries - with Matthieu, a French chef who has a nice space in the heart of Saint-Germain (the 6th Arrondissement). Learn to Make Macarons: Exactly what the title sounds like - learn how to bake macarons from start to finish, and walk away with your very own box of 15-18 to devour later. The class is gluten free, but the equipment is used in other classes (like the croissant class), so it's not suitable for Celiacs (I asked because I wanted to do it, and they advised against it). Learn to Make Croissants: Croissants might be the most iconic French pastry... and also the biggest headache to make. Where better to learn to make croissants than with the help of a real chef? Learn to Make Éclairs: Strap on your apron and get down to making éclairs, including learning the ins and outs of choux pastry (a unique kind of pastry dough that doesn't use rising agents, but employs steam to get fluffy) and get to make multiple versions of the famous éclair. Which you of course get to devour at the end. Option 2: Learn About Food Culture Through a Food Tour Here are some food tours that caught our eye though, sadly, we also skipped these because of the whole gluten and cross-contact issue. Mingle at the Market - Taste Paris: This is part market tour, part tasting. You'll meet at a local market over in the 11th Arrondissement and learn about Parisian food culture through experiencing the market and tasting a selection of foods at different stalls. It's a small group with a maximum of six guests, so you'll have plenty of time and space to ask questions and really learn about Paris through the eyes of Natasha, the host, and her team. NO DIET CLUB: First of all, their website starts with \"Bye Boring Food Tours\" and has a hilarious logo of a woman in a bikini riding a hot dog with a stein of beer and her middle finger up. But what about their tours? They have several tours in Paris where they take you around to their favorite spots in a specific neighborhood, which is the style we'd recommend. The tours last between three and four hours, and you need to show up hungry otherwise you'll lose steam halfway through. They have lunchtime tours in le Marais and Canal St. Martin, and an evening tour in Montmartre. If we had to choose, Canal St. Martin would be our pick. An Afternoon / Evening in Montmartre Montmartre, until the 19th century, was actually a completely separate town (though, it was adjacent to the borders of Paris). It was a small village on the hill with some shadier parts, some green open spaces, and a bunch of windmills that were used to grind flour for the population of the city. In the mid-to-late 19th century, it was famous for the soirees that were thrown on weekends, when wealthy Parisians would escape the city and amble up the hill to drink and dance in the gardens that provided a much-needed escape from the urban environment a few blocks away. If you go to the Musée d'Orsay (and you should!) and learn about impressionism, you'll see multiple depictions of this phenomenon, most famously Renoir's Bal du moulin de la Galette. It has also gained the reputation for being the home of the artists in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh, Renoir, many other artists in the impressionist movement, and even Pablo Picasso having lived in Montmartre for some period of time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Similar to Le Marais, Montmartre escaped the redevelopment projects that came with Napoleon III (again, not THAT Napoleon, but his nephew) that leveled huge swaths of the city to modernize it and turn it into the city you see today, with grand boulevards and wide open spaces (rather than narrow cobblestone streets). Mostly, that's because it was outside the boundaries of the city at that time. The result is an uber charming neighborhood full of cobblestones, narrow winding streets, and excellent views out over Paris (which only get better the further up the hill you venture). It's charming. It's romantic (especially before or after the bulk of the tourists arrive or leave). And it's easy to see why it has become a staple of many itineraries. Here are a few of our favorite spots in Montmartre. Sacré-Cœur: At the top of the hill is the white church on the hill - Sacré-Cœur - which boasts one of my favorite views in Paris. At the top, you'll have an up close and personal view of both Sacré-Cœur itself, and the view from the platform just below it, which looks back towards the Seine and the center of Paris. You can also climb the dome of Sacré-Cœur for even better views - it's 200+ steps, and like most church towers, they're narrow and claustrophobic. Montmartre Walking Tour: As mentioned above, I did this tour on my recent trip and it was a great dive into what makes Montmartre special (beyond the Moulin Rouge). All sorts of incredible personalities lived in Montmartre, which was originally a village on the hill outside of Paris' city limits, including many of the impressionists (including Van Gogh) and Pablo Picasso. This tour is a great deep dive into the history and culture of Montmartre, and takes a people-first approach to history that I liked. Clove: Tucked away on a side street a block away from Sacré-Cœur, you'll find one of our favorite cafes in the city. I spent part of a morning here chatting with the owners (one of whom is American) and getting to know their philosophy around coffee. They work with various European roasters that change every so often, and one of the things I noticed was the beautiful ceramics. When I asked the barista about them (and complimented the beautiful drinkware), she informed me that she had made all of them herself, which I think is a lovely touch. If you're a coffee nerd like me, go here and have them help you explore some new coffees! La Manufacture de Sans Gluten: This tiny gluten free bakery makes, hands down, one of the top three gluten free croissants I've ever eaten (they keep them in a warming case, which helps a lot). Flaky, buttery, and light - which is hard to come by when we're talking about gluten free pastries. They're pricey, but they're pretty clearly the best gluten free pastries in Paris, so...worth it! Pain Pain: If you're not gluten free, this bakery came highly recommended by the tour guide of the aforementioned walking tour (and a couple who I met on a different tour who was rating their favorite bakeries in Paris). I stopped by to check out the selection, and was drooling at all the options, sweet and savory, on display. There are two restaurants in Montmartre that came highly recommended by two locals I met over the course of my most recent trip (neither are great for Celiacs, unfortunately). They are Bouillon Pigalle, which is very popular (especially with tourists) but is still a good value and serves authentic French food (but be prepared to wait in line during peak times), and Crêperie Brocéliande, which is the place to go to try gallettes, a savory buckwheat crepe hailing from Brittany that is generally served with cider. The view from just below Sacré-Cœur Espresso at Clove Day 4: A Day Trip to Versailles As we mentioned at the beginning of this itinerary, the choice to include Versailles here might be a bit controversial. We would absolutely not spend time in Versailles with anything less than four full days in town, and even that is pushing it we'd say. However, it does tell an important story about the French Monarchy, and Versailles is, by far, the most incredible royal palace I've ever seen (and I've been to quite a few at this point). The amount of gold on display rivals St. Peter's Basilica (and serves the same purpose; the projection of power), and it's hard to believe that someone actually lived here. Which brings us to a key question: What was this place? Basically, King Louis XIV was getting sick of living in Paris amongst the peasants and decided to commission his own royal palace (on the site of an existing hunting lodge) outside the city, removed from the squalor of his people. Which, OOPS, sort of continued the French monarchy on a path to ruin because it showed that the king wasn't a man of the people AND the monarchy was broke and couldn't really afford a new royal palace. The former royal palaces are the Louvre, which was turned into a museum, and the Palais-Royal, which was given to a previous king (and Louis XIV abandoned it, giving it to his somewhat debaucherous younger brother). Anyway, Versailles is worth the better part of a day of your time to wander its halls marveling at the architecture, art, and, well, gold. Definitely don't miss the gardens either, which are equally as impressive (we think) when things are in bloom and the fountains are fountaining. I should say here that we're generally not a fan of the palaces of rich people because they're usually not particularly interesting, and we don't need to see some old king's fancy art collection. Which at least partially applies to Versailles. The other thing to know about Versailles is that it's a short (90 ish minutes each way) train ride outside of Paris, which means that you're going to spend a bit of time in transit to get here. Last, but certainly not least, is that Versailles is going to be crowded AF, and there's basically no way to get around it. Especially mid-morning when all the tour buses rock up. The point here is that it's very much not worth it if you either: a) don't care about a decommissioned royal palaces that are just one big obscene display of wealth b) you have less than four or five days to spend on Paris (with less than that, we'd argue you're better off staying in Paris) c) you're not interested in being one of 200 people in a room with a capacity of 50 people looking at a painting of the aforementioned rich guy We're not saying we hate Versailles at all - it's actually an interesting place from a historical and cultural perspective because it was one domino on the road to the French Revolution - but it is very much a busy tourist attraction, and you should set expectations accordingly. Whether or not to do a tour here is somewhat more complicated than museums in Paris. A tour means you're going to be on a strict timeline and, unlike a museum tour that ends inside and affords you the ability to continue exploring, a tour here likely includes transportation from Paris. On the other hand, the security lines at Versailles are LONG, and guided tours with a licensed guide get to use a separate entrance with shorter security lines. I have a couple of recommendations for tours of Versailles that I had bookmarked for my recent trip to Paris (I ended up cutting Versailles because I had done it multiple times before and it was November, which means the gardens are gray, drizzly, and dead). I think they offer a somewhat unique approach to visiting Versailles. The first is this full day bike tour, which spends a full day out at Versailles and includes some time exploring the less-visited nearby sights, including the town of Versailles itself. Being on a bike makes it a little more feasible to cover this much ground (you're only on a bike outside the palace and gardens, if you're wondering). For what it's worth, that would be my top choice if I were going to do a tour of Versailles tomorrow because I think it's a unique approach to visiting one of the most popular tourist attractions in France. The second is this more traditional tour of Versailles with a Parisian tour company (which I appreciate). It includes transportation to and from Paris, but it does end at the palace (which gives you more time to explore if you want) and spends a fair amount of time (three hours or so) on the palace and gardens. Some tours try to do it all - palace and gardens - in an hour and a half, which I think is madness. The palace at Versailles is closed on Mondays, so plan accordingly. Getting to Versailles To get to Versailles from Paris, the easiest route is to hop on the RER-C. The line runs along the Seine (which means it's easily accessible). Take it to the stop called \"Chateau Rive Gauche\" ( here on Google Maps). From there, it's a short walk to the entrance. This route takes roughly 90 minutes, maybe a bit shorter depending on the day and where you're riding from. However, the RER-C has some notable downsides, like the fact that it's subject to closures and delays. Another option is catching the N Train from Gare Montparnasse, which is MUCH faster but takes you to a different station (Versailles-Chantiers) that means a longer walk to the palace. There's also an L Train from Gare Saint-Lazare to Versailles Rive Droite (you need to make sure you get on the line that goes there) that gets you to the chateau in a similar manner, but is probably less convenient unless you're staying in the 9th or Montmartre. Tips for Visiting Independently Definitely book tickets in advance here and try to get either an early morning entry or, alternatively, a later afternoon entry (think 2-3pm or so), when the palace is relatively quiet. You'll still have to wait in the (sometimes long) security lines. If you want to see the gardens and it is high season, book the \"Passport\" which includes the palace, gardens, and Estate of Trianon. In the low season, from November through March, the cheaper Palace ticket actually includes the gardens (but NOT the Estate of Trianon, if you want to see that). This is another place where I highly recommend the audio guide, at least partially because it's crowded and you won't always be able to get up close to read the signage. More Paris Travel Guides Planning a trip to Paris? Matt, who speaks French \"really well for an American\" (as multiple French people have told him - it's his proudest achievement in life), loves Paris. As you get into planning your trip, you might find some of these other detailed guides we've written about Paris helpful.

I recently spent 10 full days exploring Paris and never once ran out of things to do (here's our complete guide to our favorite things to do in Paris), see, eat, or drink. However, our best advice here is to take the things above at a more leisurely pace, spending more time savoring the sights, sounds, and tastes of Paris. Go Deeper with a Walking Tour Over the past few years, we've come to the realization that walking tours are often our favorite way to get oriented in a new city for a few reasons. First, you get a crash course in history and culture, which is a valuable baseline that will make the rest of your trip more enjoyable. Second, you get to spend a few hours with a local who will give you all sorts of tips about what to eat, drink (and see), and specifically where to find the best version of said things. Last, but not least you'll discover places that you definitely would never have found on your own. We almost always start our trip with a walking tour for these reasons (and the fact that it's helpful to get outside and move to combat jet lag). Like we mentioned above, Paris is slightly too big to really cover a bunch of ground on foot, but what you can do is explore a far more targeted slice of Paris with a local to get a deeper understanding of the culture and history of a time period or neighborhood. I have done several of this type of tour over my trips to Paris. Here are three tours that I'd look at, two of which I have personally done and enjoyed. The French Revolution Tour: On a trip to Paris a few years ago, I discovered Thierry's tours near the end of our visit, and wasn't able to make the timing work with our schedule. I bookmarked them and saved them for a future trip and, on this most recent trip, ended up doing two of his tours. Thierry is a (very passionate) historian who will dive into French history's important moments - in this case, the French revolution - and spend a couple of hours teaching you the basics of what happened, who was involved, and how it affects France today. He's an engaging storyteller, and this tour in particular was a favorite because I, an American, didn't learn that much about the French Revolution in school, so this filled in a lot of gaps. I also did his Napoleon tour - I'm particularly interested in Napoleon and his impact on Europe's modernization and liberalization - and found it to be a great way to set the record straight for people who didn't learn anything other than \"short dictator\" in school. Medieval Paris Walking Tour: This tour is with Walks, one of my favorite tour companies in Europe with whom I have done multiple tours, including one in Paris (though, for transparency's sake, not this one). I had this tour on my radar for my last trip, and it ended up getting cut to do other things (mostly drink coffee, walk, and eat more gluten free pastries). It focuses on the medieval core of Paris, which is Île de la Cité and the area around it, and includes entry to both Notre Dame and Sainte-Chappelle, two must-see churches in Paris (I think). It will give you a nice baseline for understanding the city, its layout, and its history. Montmartre Walking Tour: I did this great tour on my recent trip, where I actually stayed in Montmartre for half of my time in Paris, and it was an informative dive into what makes Montmartre special (beyond the Moulin Rouge). All sorts of incredible personalities lived in Montmartre, which was originally a village on the hill outside of Paris' city limits, including many of the impressionists (including Van Gogh) and Pablo Picasso. This tour offers a fascinating deep dive into the history and culture of Montmartre, and takes a people-first approach to history that I liked. The Rodin Museum This might actually be our favorite museum in Paris! The reason we like it is that, rather than being a huge collection of art cobbled together by some rich family centuries ago, it follows the life of the famous sculptor Auguste Rodin, and shows his progression throughout his life from his first official works to world-famous pieces like the Thinker and the Gates of Hell. The garden (really, it's a sculpture garden) is gorgeous too, and well worth walking around. Get the audio guide - it's excellent! It's in the 7th Arrondissement. More information like hours and costs here. Take a Seine River Cruise To be completely honest, we've never actually done this ourselves. The reason it shows up here is twofold. One, I did a canal cruise in Amsterdam on a recent trip that turned out to be one of my favorite things to do in Amsterdam, and offered a completely different perspective of the city than I had previously gotten. Second, I have heard from both readers and fellow travelers that this is consistently one of their favorite things to do. There are hundreds of versions of this cruise, and my advice would be to choose one with a smaller company and, ideally, a smaller boat where you get live commentary or a live guide where you can ask questions and actually learn about the city. What To Do with Less Time in Paris With less time in Paris, we'd recommend cutting the number of things you're trying to fit in. The alternative - trying to fit the same number of attractions into a shorter time - will leave you needing a vacation from your vacation. I'm speaking from experience here. The first thing to cut is the day trip to Versailles. It's cool, sure, but at the end of the day it's just a rich person's palace with some beautiful gardens. We love the Jardins du Luxembourg in the 6 th Arrondissement (included in the itinerary above), which are a little less manicured, but are a good substitute. 3 Days in Paris With three days, cut the day trip to Versailles and follow the itinerary as written above for days 1-3. This is an easy one. 2 Days in Paris / A Weekend in Paris If you've only got a couple of days in Paris, the first thing we'd do is choose between the Louvre and Musée d'Orsay. There's so much to see in Paris that, with only a couple of days, we don't think it makes sense to spend 3-4 hours on each museum, which is the amount of time you'd need to do them both justice. The second thing we'd recommend is to pick two of the neighborhoods on day 3, and we'd recommend that you choose Montmartre and Le Marais (sorry, Canal St. Martin!). Here's what two days in Paris could look like. Day 1: Montmartre, Le Marais, and the Eiffel Tower Day 2: The Gothic Cathedrals, a Foodie Adventure, the Louvre, and the Arc de Triomphe You can still use the relevant sections of the detailed 4 day itinerary above to plan out the specifics of your weekend in Paris. One Day in Paris Our first tip for spending a day in Paris is to book a second (or third). Joking aside, trying to see it all in a day just isn't going to happen, which means you'll need to prioritize and make some hard choices on what to save for next time. One big assumption we're going to make here is that you want to see the Louvre. If that's true, that's going to eat up a significant chunk of time that you're going to have to plan around. You could easily swap the Louvre for the Musée d'Orsay, if you've already done the Louvre before, or want something a little different. We'd also highly recommend investing in a 24 hour Metro Pass to make getting around Paris more efficient. Here are the things we think you should focus on with one day in Paris: The Louvre OR the Musée d'Orsay The Gothic Cathedrals and Le Marais The Eiffel Tower We'd start with the Louvre when they open (go to Telescope Coffee, some of the best coffee in Paris, nearby for coffee and pastries beforehand!) and spend the morning exploring their extensive collection, preferably on this guided tour, which we recently did and loved. Then, make your way east through Le Marais, stopping at the Marche des Enfants Rouge for lunch and exploring the 3 rd and 4 th Arrondissements en route to the two Gothic Cathedrals, Notre Dame (the interior and bell tower are closed indefinitely, but it's worth admiring the twin towering bell towers from outside) and Sainte-Chappelle. To end your day, take the metro over to the 7 th Arrondissement to end your day in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. Relax there for a bit, then walk under the tower (go up to the top if you want - make sure to book tickets in advance) and take in the view from Trocadéro, which is across the river to the west and has our favorite views of the tower.

to a Longtime Francophile Destinations Europe France Paris How to Spend 3 Days in Paris -- Luxury Hotels, Natural Wine Spots, and Under-the-radar Museums Included From picturesque walks to souvenir shopping, a longtime Francophile shares her ideal three-day Paris itinerary. By Sophie Dodd Sophie Dodd Sophie Dodd is a travel, wine and lifestyle writer. Travel + Leisure Editorial Guidelines Updated on June 18, 2024 In This Article View All In This Article Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Paris in One Day Paris in One Week Close Photo: Sophie Dodd/Travel + Leisure On a recent layover in Paris, I spent 15 minutes weeping outside a boulangerie, hands clutching my croissant like a stress ball as I spiraled into decision-paralysis mode. How do I make the most of 24 hours here? I asked myself, my mind racing over how to fit a week's worth of explorations into one day. The answer ended up being: Stop stressing. Walk around. Eat the crushed croissant, and drink a glass of wine with lunch. Paris provides endless temptations: art and architecture, Michelin-star restaurants, unrivaled vintage shopping, fantastic hotels, and four-euro wine. There's no way to do it all, so allowing yourself some grace to wander aimlessly -- the French call it flânerie --is key to making the most of your trip. To that end, I suggest basing yourself around the incredibly walkable Marais, which marries classic Parisian architecture with hip restaurants and shops. I'd spring for the new cool-kid hideaway, Le Grand Mazarin, a maximalist hotel that boasts an indoor pool and hammam to revive you after a long day. Here, I've curated a jam-packed three-day itinerary for a quick trip to Paris, in a bid to prevent myself and everyone else from ever ruining a perfectly good croissant out of choice-anxiety again. Pick what works for you, skip what doesn't (but not Musée Bourdelle). Keep in mind that many of the city's attractions and restaurants close on Sunday and/or Monday, so be sure to check their hours in advance. Whatever you do, I hope you people-watch at a cafe somewhere, lingering long enough to convince yourself you might be picking up French by osmosis. I hope you notice how the limestone avenues absorb the light, and maybe a little piece of you, too. Sophie Dodd/Travel + Leisure Day 1 After an overnight flight, I always start my day with my favorite French comfort food: a galette complète from Breizh Café, which has several outposts around the city that whip up some of the best buckwheat crepes in Paris. Tucking into their famous complète oignons -- layers of ham and Comté cheese topped with a sunny-side up egg and onions decadently caramelized in cider from Brittany -- is the warmest welcome you'll find in the French capital. Walk off your breakfast with a stroll through the Marais, making your way toward beloved concept store Merci to satisfy all your souvenir needs, from stationery to expertly curated home goods, clothing, and beyond. If jet lag is setting in, grab a coffee at their Used Book Café, or down the road at the oft-Instagrammed Boot Café. Mosey over to Place des Vosges, the oldest square in the city. In the warmer months, it's a lively picnic destination for locals and tourists alike. The manicured trees, stone fountains, and red brick archways surrounding the leafy square are stunning from any angle, but if you're looking to experience the square's royal history from a whole new perspective, consider splurging on a room at Cour des Vosges. The refined five-star hotel offers luxuriously intimate accommodations without fuss or ostentation -- plus, exclusive views onto the square from the comfort of your bed. Hidden just beyond the square are the courtyard and gardens of the Hôtel de Sully, a quieter green space offering a wonderful respite from the bustling Rue Saint-Antoine. From there, walk down to the Seine and cross over to Île Saint-Louis, a jewel-sized island where you can admire the elegant 17th-century architecture and stop by L'Étiquette, a beloved natural wine spot that offers takeaway bottles and wine tastings with the owner, Hervé. While the Notre-Dame cathedral is still under renovation (it's set to reopen in December 2024),you can still admire its striking Gothic facade before walking to nearby Shakespeare and Company, the city's famous English-language bookstore. Post up at the counter of L'Avant Comptoir de la Terre for a light lunch of Basque-style tapas (don't skip the seared foie gras) and, oui, more wine. Afterward, wander around the chic side streets of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, home to Paris institutions like Les Deux Magots and Café de Flore, plus a bevy of art galleries and upscale shops that are better to visit here than on the over-crowded Champs-Élysées; some favorites for window shopping include Le Bon Marché (the Left Bank's grand dame department store), the fabulously decorated Hermès store, and Officine Universelle Buly, which crafts spectacular candles that make for ultra-chic souvenirs. If you're up for it, pause to people-watch at the always-bustling Bar du Marché before heading back to your hotel to rest up before dinner. To finish the day, book a table in the bustling 11th arrondissement at Le Bistrot Paul Bert, which serves elevated comfort food -- think steak frites, seafood, and epic desserts --that's earned a devout fan base. Sophie Dodd/Travel + Leisure Day 2 Today's the day to pack in your museum visits and sightseeing. Wake up early and grab breakfast at your hotel, or treat yourself to a top-notch coffee and croissant at a cafe. Walk over to the Louvre, where you should arrive 30 minutes before opening if you're hoping to snap a selfie with the Mona Lisa. Frankly, if you only have three days, I'd skip it in favor of visiting some of the city's other world-class museums -- but be sure to at least stroll around the iconic I. M. Pei-designed glass pyramid and the historic courtyard. While you could head straight to the Tuileries Garden from here, I love to detour to the Palais-Royal Garden first, an oasis that's home to a picture-perfect fountain rimmed by those iconic green Sénat chairs. Pass through the palace's inner courtyard on your way there, where you can scramble around Daniel Buren's famous black-and-white Colonnes de Buren installation. Just beyond the garden is Galerie Vivienne, a breathtaking 19th-century covered passage with mosaic floors, antique glass ceilings, and a delightful bookshop. When I think about some of the places that first sparked my love of Paris more than a decade ago, these are what come to mind. Make your way back to the Tuileries Garden and on to your next museum. Impressionist lovers who are short on time should prioritize the Musée de l'Orangerie to bask in the beauty of Monet's \"Water Lilies,\" or plan to linger a little longer across the river at the expansive Musée d'Orsay, which is housed in a former Beaux-Arts train station. Sculpture fans should check out the nearby Musée Rodin, or consider the worthwhile trek into Montparnasse to be blown away by the works and former studio of sculptor Antoine Bourdelle at the lesser-known Musée Bourdelle. Whichever museums you choose to visit, be sure to book your ticket in advance to avoid massive lines. For lunch, book the three-course tasting menu at Substance, a sleek and modern Michelin-starred restaurant in the 16th arrondissement that boasts one of the finest Champagne lists in all of Paris. It's right around the corner from Place du Trocadéro, an elevated (but typically tourist-swarmed) plaza that offers sweeping views of the Eiffel Tower. From there, hop on the metro line 6 (or in a taxi, if you prefer) to the Arc de Triomphe. The panoramic view from the top is both fantastic and incredibly crowded; I'd rather enjoy the cityscape later on with a drink in hand at Bonnie, SO/Paris hotel's trendy terrace restaurant that's back over in the fourth arrondissement. But first, take your time wandering the iconic Champs-Élysées, making your way toward the storied Place de la Concorde -- the famous site of Marie Antoinette's beheading by guillotine. Chances are, you might need a drink after that; duck into Hôtel de Crillon, A Rosewood Hotel, to check out the opulent Bar Les Ambassadeurs. (Pro tip: Be sure to snap a selfie in the marble bathroom.) Stick around the area for dinner. Try to nab a table at the ultra-trendy Hotel Costes -- reservations are hard to come by, but the red-lit atmosphere is glamorous, and the legendary DJ sets continue late into the night. Sophie Dodd/Travel + Leisure Day 3 For a new perspective on the city, take yourself up the steep steps of Montmartre, Paris' longtime artist haven. You'll beat the crowds if you arrive early in the morning, and the best place to start is Place Dalida, where you'll be rewarded with a bucolic view of Sacré-Coeur Basilica. Climbing the cobbled slope of Rue de l'Abreuvoir is a chance to travel back in time, bearing witness to a nostalgic snapshot of what this neighborhood used to feel like. Whatever the season, this street is utterly charming -- bursting with wisteria in summer and framed by red and golden leaves in autumn. Pass by the pink facade of La Maison Rose to snap some classic shots on your way up to Le Clos Montmartre, Paris' only vineyard. (It's privately owned, but guided tours are organized a few times per year.) This part of the city feels like walking through a film set -- it's all steep stone steps framed by vintage street lamps, with a sprinkling of bistros thrown in. To that end, peek around Place du Tertre, a definitively touristy but still-charming square (if you get there ahead of the crowds, that is), which is filled with artists who will ask to paint your portrait. (Note: This area is known for pickpocketing, so keep your belongings secure.) Next, ogle the majesty of Sacré-Coeur, which offers one of the most spectacular views of Paris spread out below. If it's still early enough, head over to the Musée de la Vie Romantique (Museum of Romantic Life) for a coffee and pastry at the Rose Bakery tearoom, tucked into their unsurprisingly romantic courtyard and greenhouse. But don't spoil your appetite -- you won't want to miss the inventive small plates and next-level wine list at Mokonuts, an intimate lunch spot run by a Japanese-Lebanese couple serving up what has consistently ranked among my favorite meals in Paris. The food is fantastic, the 11th arrondissement space is unfussy, and the reservations are hard to come by (call and hope for a cancellation --it happens more often than you'd think). Order the entire menu (it's small), including at least two desserts. Trust me. If it's warm out, go lounge along Canal Saint-Martin or the banks of the Seine, where locals picnic, read, smoke, and smooch -- take your pick. On colder days, round off your museum visits with a trip to the Centre Pompidou for modern art or Musée Carnavalet (housed in two fabulous mansions) to delve into the history of Paris. For dinner, few restaurants charm so instantly as Le Clown Bar -- famous for their veal brains and sweetbreads, I choose to go for the delightfully kitschy Belle Époque clown decor. On a recent trip, I skipped the brains and went for the Japanese-inspired beef tartare --few days have passed that I haven't thought about it. There's an abundance of natural wine that will appeal to a range of palates, including those who think natural wine is \"too funky.\" If you're looking for a nightcap (it's your last night in Paris!), Little Red Door serves up exceptional and inventive cocktails around the corner. Taylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure Paris in One Day If you've only got one day in Paris -- perhaps you're on a long layover -- you'll need to remind yourself from the beginning: You can't do it all. I've nearly ruined several brief trips by thinking about all the things I should have packed in, rather than feeling present in the few that I was able to manage. If it's your first time, I'd combine the itineraries for days one and two. Base yourself a bit more central to the main attractions -- for a night of absolute pampering, treat yourself to a stay at Hôtel de Crillon, A Rosewood Hotel, or Le Meurice -- two luxury properties just off the Tuileries Garden. Wake up early and indulge in room service or grab a fresh croissant from a boulangerie near your hotel, and savor every second of that interaction -- the greasy bag, the warm dough, the flaky mess of it all. Start at the Palais-Royal Garden and Galerie Vivienne before ducking over to see Notre-Dame. Unless you're a serious art history buff, I'd avoid spending your one day inside a museum, but you should still wander around the Louvre courtyard and Tuileries Garden -- Le Cafe Marly is a pricey lunch, but offers classic French dishes served with iconic views of the pyramid. Grab the metro over to Place du Trocadero for some Eiffel Tower time, wander the Champs-Élysées, then stop back at the hotel to freshen up before taking yourself a bit further afield for dinner -- go for Bistrot des Tournelles, another excellent spot for homemade pork terrine, steak frites, chocolate mousse, and other French comforts. Page Light Studios/Getty Images Paris in One Week La chance! (What luck!) You can take your days a bit easier than the itinerary suggested here, lingering a little longer at cafes perhaps and spreading out more museum visits (you really shouldn't miss Musée Bourdelle in this case). While you could easily spend the whole week in Paris, you might want to plan an overnight to Versailles, where you should book a royally exceptional stay at the opulent Airelles Château de Versailles, Le Grand Contrôle, the only hotel on the palace grounds. If you're visiting Paris in winter, you'll want to make time for the festive holiday markets, while in summer, the Seine beckons with its faux beach. Whatever the season, the best thing you can do with your extra time is allow yourself to wander aimlessly, letting the city reveal its magic to you.

We put together this 3-day Paris itinerary to help you have the best experience. About this Itinerary Paris is one of Europe's most popular destinations and with that, lines can be long to visit the more popular sites. The last thing you want to do on vacation is to wait in line after line after line. What fun would that be? We put a lot of research into how to skip the lines at these attractions. You will have to book some tickets in advance but it will save you hours once you are in Paris. All of the links to book your tickets are included in this post. To avoid museum fatigue, I didn't put too many museums in one day. Yes, the art museums in Paris are amazing, but most people can't handle more than two museums per day. I know I can't! Finally, all of the times in the daily schedule are rough estimates, just to give you an idea about timing throughout the day. Your times may differ, based on queues and how much time you decide to spend at each place. I did my best to anticipate waiting times and visiting times, but on very busy days (or very quiet days) these times can differ. I do my best to keep the hours of operation and pricing up to date for each attraction, however, these can change at any time. I recommend getting updated hours and pricing for your dates of travel.

The line to visit the Eiffel Tower can be epic (I'm talking 2 to 3 hours wait on the busiest days). You can avoid this nightmare by booking your tickets in advance or taking a skip-the-line tour. The cheapest way to visit the Eiffel Tower is to purchase your tickets online in advance on the official website, but these tend to sell out almost as soon as they become available (60 days in advance). If they are sold out, we recommend this skip the line tour, which costs just slightly more than the ticket cost. We took this same tour and had a great experience. There are two ways up the Eiffel Tower. You can take an elevator or you can walk up the stairs. The queues for the elevators are very long and the queue for the stairs is much shorter. The choice is yours. If you take the stairs, you get to eat more chocolate and crepes later! If you plan to take the elevator, I highly recommend that you book your tickets in advance. PRO TRAVEL TIP: Online tickets go on sale 60 days in advance for the elevator, 14 days in advance for the stairs.

On our first visit to Paris, Tim and I did this and it was one of many favorite memories from Paris. There's something about sitting in the park, eating cheese and chocolate, and enjoying the view of the Eiffel Tower. It was such a great experience that we did it again several years later with Tyler, Kara, and our mothers. From the Eiffel Tower, it's another very pretty walk to Rue Cler. On this short shopping street, go shopping in the patisseries (pastry shops), boulangeries (bread shops), fromageries (cheese shops), and shops selling fruit and chocolate. Places to visit on Rue Cler: Le Chocolat Alain Ducasse for gourmet chocolate La Fromagerie for cheese There are other small markets where you can purchase fruit, bread, crackers, meat and cheese Les Grandes Caves for a bottle of wine Take your food and find a nice spot on Champ de Mars and enjoy the view. Champ de Mars 1 pm: The Louvre The Louvre is the world's largest art museum. This building was once the home to French Kings, including Louis XIV. During the French Revolution in the 18th century, the Louvre was converted to a museum. This place is massive and you literally could spend days here. My favorite part about visiting the Louvre is just taking in the grandeur of the building. The sheer size of this place is impressive. Several rooms, like the Apollo Gallery (where the crown jewels are kept), are gorgeous. The Louvre Apollo Gallery If you are an art lover, take several hours and enjoy this spectacular place. However, if you just want to visit the highlights, you can do so in about an hour. The main sites to visit in the Louvre are the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory. How to Visit the Louvre There are several ways to avoid waiting in a long line to get into the Louvre. Purchase the Museum Pass. This allows you to skip the ticket line but you may still have to wait in a much shorter security line. With the Museum Pass, you must book a time slot in order to guarantee access into the museum. You must provide the serial number of your Museum Pass, so you cannot do this until you are in possession of the Museum Pass. Learn more here. Book your tickets online in advance.

From the Louvre, walk through the Tuileries Garden and cross Rue de Rivoli to Angelina. Angelina serves decadent hot chocolate and delicious French pastries. Enjoy! Hot Chocolate at Angelina's 4:30 pm: Place de la Concorde From Angelina, stroll through Tuileries Garden or along the Rue de Rivoli to Place de la Concorde. This famous square is full of French history. This was the spot during the French Revolution where King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and Robespierre were executed by guillotine. From mid-November to early May a giant Ferris wheel sits in Place de la Concorde. If the line is short and you want a nice view of Paris, consider taking a ride. 5 pm: Champs-Élysées The Champs-Élysées is one of the most recognizable streets in the world. It is famous as being the finish of the Tour de France and the location of the Bastille Day military parade. Restaurants, shops, the theaters line the Champs-Élysées. It has a touristy feel but it's still worth the stroll. Champs-Élysées | 3 Days in Paris Itinerary Along the way, if you want another French treat, consider stopping into Laduree for macarons. From Place de la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe, it is a 2.3 km (1.4 mile) walk. You can walk the entire length of the Champs-Élysées or shorten the walk by taking line 1 on the metro from Concorde to Franklin D. Roosevelt or George V. 6:30 pm: Arc de Triomphe It's time to take in the view from the mighty Arc de Triomphe. This is my favorite view of Paris. There's just something about looking down the Champs-Élysées to the Louvre, out to La Defense, and of course, having the wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower. While on top of the Arc, look straight down. You are standing at one of the world's largest round-abouts, where twelve avenues come together. Watching the cars navigate this circle is very entertaining. View from the Arc de Triomphe Champs-Élysées from the Arc de Triomphe Fun Fact: Did you know that the Arc de Triomphe was almost a statue of a giant elephant? 45 years before the Arc was built, French architect Ribart proposed to build a 3-level elephant at the same site. The French government shot down this proposal. Could you imagine a giant elephant in the center of Paris?

Closest metro station: Charles de Gaulle Etoile lines 1, 2 and 6 Powered by GetYourGuide Dinner, Drinks & a Seine River Cruise End the day with dinner and drinks. For dinner, your options are endless. Paris is filled with rooftop bars and restaurants with a view of the city, quaint sidewalk cafes, and fine dining restaurants. For recommendations on where to eat and drink, check out our guides to the Rooftop Restaurants and Bars in Paris and 10 Foods to Eat in Paris (and where to get them). Some of our favorite places to eat are Les Ombres (an upscale French restaurant with an incredible view of the Eiffel Tower), Langosteria (an upscale Italian restaurant with a view of Pont Neuf and the Seine River), and if you want the experience of dining on the Eiffel Tower, Madame Brasserie or Le Jules Verne. L'Oiseau Blanc For an amazing culinary experience with a view of Paris, take a look at L'Oiseau Blanc, a 2-star Michelin restaurant with a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower. If you are looking for a very cool dinner/drink spot, go to the Buddha Bar. We loved it here. The lower level is a restaurant and along the second level are lounge areas with views over the restaurant. It feels like you have left Paris and entered Asia. Buddha Bar You also have the option to take a Seine River cruise. There are sunset cruises, dinner cruises, and nighttime cruises along the Seine River. These typically last 1 to 2 hours and some cruises include drinks and/or a meal. This evening dinner cruise gets rave reviews and starts at 8:30 pm, so you have plenty of time to visit the Arc de Triomphe and get to the meeting point for the cruise. Day 2 The Historic Center of Paris, Musee d'Orsay & Montmartre 8:00 am: Île de la Cité Our day starts with a visit to Sainte-Chapelle. You can take the metro to Cité, the closest station, but I recommend a more scenic route with just a little more walking. Île de la Cité is the small island in the center of Paris that is home to Sainte-Chapelle and Notre Dame. It is the historic heart of Paris. Approaching it from the Right Bank and crossing Pont Neuf onto Île de la Cité (the oldest bridge in Paris) is a very scenic way to start the day. For a scenic walk to Île de la Cité, I recommend taking the metro to Louvre-Rivoli or Pont Neuf, walking towards the Seine, and then walking along the river to Pont Neuf. Pont Neuf is the stone bridge that crosses the Seine on the western edge of the island. From Pont Neuf, enjoy the view along the Seine, to the next bridge, Pont des Arts, and to the Eiffel Tower off in the distance. 9 am: Sainte-Chapelle Sainte-Chapelle is home to one of the world's best displays of stained glass. It is gorgeous inside, much prettier than the inside of Notre Dame Cathedral. Sainte Chapelle This is another location that is notorious for having long lines so, for the best experience, purchase your ticket in advance (on the official website, you will book a time slot for your visit). Hours: April 1 to September 30: 9 am to 7 pm; October 1 to March 31: 9 am to 5 pm; closed January 1, May 1, December 25 Cost: €13; included with the Museum Pass Combo Ticket with Conciergerie: €0 Metro Station: Line 4, Cite Website: Sainte-Chapelle can close on other days during the year. Check their website to confirm hours before your visit. Skip-the-Line Tickets: On GetYourGuide, you can get a skip-the-line-ticket combination ticket for both Sainte-Chapelle and the Conciergerie. The Conciergerie This is optional, but for those with an interest in French history, you can visit the Conciergerie. This is where people were imprisoned before taken to Place de la Concorde to be executed. Marie Antoinette is the most famous prisoner. The Conciergerie is located next to Sainte-Chapelle. Hours: Open every day 9:30 am to 6 pm Cost: €13; Combination ticket with Sainte-Chapelle €0; included with the Museum Pass 10:30 am: Notre Dame Cathedral From Sainte-Chapelle it's a very short walk to Notre Dame Cathedral. In front of Notre Dame Cathedral a small plaque marks Point Zero (Point Zero des Routes de France), the historic center of Paris. In 2019, Notre Dame closed after a devastating fire destroyed parts of the cathedral. The cathedral underwent a massive restoration project, partially reopening in December 2024. Visitors can now enter Notre Dame Cathedral. To do this, you can either book a time slot in advance (this is free to do on the official website) or get in line at the entrance to the cathedral. Making a reservation in advance can save a lot of time, as there is generally a queue to enter Notre Dame Cathedral. The towers are still closed indefinitely, although you can get updates about their reopening on the official website. Once finished at Notre Dame, walk through Île de la Cité. It is a quick walk to one of the prettiest storefronts in Paris, Au Vieux d'Arcole. This is a small cafe so you can eat an early lunch here. Au Vieux Paris 11:30 am: Île Saint-Louis From Île de la Cité, cross Pont Saint-Louis to Île Saint-Louis. This island gets fewer visitors than Île de la Cité and it is a good place to go shopping and have lunch. A good lunch spot is Pom' Canelle, a restaurant that serves French and European food at reasonable prices (location: 27 Rue des 2 Ponts). For an amazing ice cream shop, it is just a one minute walk to Bertillon Glacier. This place is world famous for its ice cream and sorbet. In fact, you could skip lunch and just eat here instead (we did!). Note: There are several ice cream shops with name Berthillon in the area. You want to visit the one in this photo with the address 29-31 Rue Saint-Louis en l'Ile. 1 pm: Walk along the Seine Cross Pont de la Tournelle to the Left Bank. Walk along the Seine. As you approach Pont de l'Archeveche you get a beautiful view of Notre Dame. Pont de l'Archeveche makes a great photo spot of Notre Dame. Note: Currently, the back of Notre Dame is covered with elaborate scaffolding. It's still a sight to see, the amazing amount of work that is going into restoring this landmark. Pont de L'Archeveche As you continue your walk along the river you will notice stands set up selling books. These booksellers, or \"bouquinistes\" sell used books, magazines, and posters. Bouquinistes You will also pass Shakespeare & Company. This bookstore opened in 1919 and was a gathering place for Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, and Ezra Pound. Continue the stroll along the Seine until you reach Musee d'Orsay. 2 pm: Musée d'Orsay I will admit it, I am not an art museum lover. But I do love Musée d'Orsay. This museum is simply fabulous. If you arrive here at 2 pm, you have 4 hours to tour the museum, more than enough time to really enjoy the main exhibits. Musée d'Orsay houses the largest collection of Impressionist art in the world. It is here that you can see Monet, Manet, Degas, Cezanne, Renoir, Van Gogh, Gaugin and more. It's literally a collection of the who's who in the Impressionist art world. But this museum is more than just Impressionist art. The building is also a work of art. Musée d'Orsay was once Gare d'Orsay, an old train station, that was renovated and became this art museum. It is beautiful inside. Musée D'Orsay | 3 Days in Paris Itinerary On the top floor, look for the giant clock windows that give you a very unique view of Paris and make a creative photographic spot. Hours: Daily 9:30 am to 6 pm; open until 9:45 on Thursday; closed Mondays, May 1, and December 25 Cost: €16, included with the Museum Pass. You can purchase an advanced ticket on the official website. Website: Get updated hours and pricing on the official website. Optional: Musée de l'Orangerie This is a small museum that features Impressionist artwork. The highlights of this museum are the eight Water Lilies murals painted by Claude Monet. You can also see art by Picasso, Sisley, Cezanne, Matisse, and more. Musée de l'Orangerie If you are doing good on time and like the idea of visiting another Impressionist art museum, it's easy to add Musée de l'Orangerie onto today. This museum is much smaller than Musee d'Orsay, so it doesn't take up much of your time. You could simply see the Water Lilies Murals or tour the entire museum. Getting Here: From Musée d'Orsay, cross the Seine River to the Tuileries Garden. Musée de l'Orangerie is located on the southwest corner of Tuileries Garden, just a 10 minute walk from Musée d'Orsay. Hours: 9 am to 6 pm, Wednesday through Monday; closed on Tuesday. Cost: €12.50, included with the Museum Pass Website: Get updated hours and pricing on the official website. 6 pm: Sacre-Coeur and Montmartre Spend the rest of the afternoon and evening exploring Montmartre. This maze of hilly streets is one of Paris' prettiest neighborhoods to visit. I recommend getting off at the Lamarck metro station and walking towards the Sacre-Coeur Basilica. This is a very nice walk that takes you past photogenic spots such as La Maison Rose and Le Consulat Restaurant. Montmartre Montmartre Before arriving at the basilica you will walk through Place du Tertre. This small square is filled with artists. Go shopping, grab a drink at a café, or have your portrait drawn. Place du Tertre The Sacre-Coeur Basilica sits atop the highest hill in Paris. The steps in front of the Basilica are a popular spot to watch the sunset. You also have the option to climb the 300 steps to the top of the Dome for an even better view. Sacre-Coeur Hours: 6:30 am to 10:30 pm For more information, visit the official website. If you want to take a guided tour of Montmartre and the Sacre Coeur, this one hour tour gets excellent reviews. 7:00 pm: Dinner Here are a few dinner ideas for tonight. On our most recent trip to Paris, we dined at Maggie Restaurant, which is located inside of Hotel Rochechouart, within walking distance of the Sacre Coeur basilica. We had a wonderful dinner, dining on roasted turbot and seared scallops and the largest artichoke I've ever seen. On top of the hotel is a rooftop bar and terrace with a view of Sacre Coeur and the city skyline. Le Relais Gascon. We had a wonderful dinner here. This restaurant serves French food and is located in Montmartre. La Maison Rose. The photogenic café also makes a great spot for dinner. It is located in Montmartre. Le Moulin Rouge. End the day with a show at the Moulin Rouge. Dinner shows start at 7 pm and includes a 3-course dinner along with the show. The later shows (at 9 pm and 11 pm) do not include dinner. Tickets for the Moulin Rouge book up months in advance and if tickets are sold out for your visit, you can also check GetYourGuide. After dinner, Le Chat Noir is a great spot for drinks, if you aren't quite ready to end the day. It's just a short walk from the Moulin Rouge. From the Sacre-Coeur, you can walk to the Moulin Rouge or ride the metro to Pigalle. France Travel Guide See all of our articles Day 3 Versailles & More Time in Paris The Palace of Versailles Versailles is a royal chateau located on the outskirts of Paris. In 1682, King Louis XIV moved the Royal Court from the Louvre to the Palace of Versailles. For a little more than 100 years, this was the seat of government for France. That ended in 1789 with the French Revolution. The Treaty of Versailles was signed in the Hall of Mirrors, ending World War I. During your visit to Versailles you have the option to tour the palace and get to stroll through the gorgeous gardens. The Latona Basin The Hall of Mirrors | Read our guide How to Visit Versailles to learn how to take this photo without the crowds The Orangery How long does a visit last? If you're fast, it takes 3 to 4 hours to zip through the palace and walk through a portion of the gardens. Some people spend all day here, touring the entire gardens as well as the Estate of Trianon. On this itinerary, you can spend all day at Versailles or just spend the morning at Versailles, using the afternoon to visit a few more places in Paris. Plan Your Visit to Versailles In our Guide to Versailles, we cover the best things to do at Versailles, how to get here, how to avoid the crowds, and ticket and tour options. Hours: The palace is closed Mondays; the palace is open at 9 am to 5:30 pm; the gardens and the park are open every day and are free to visit. Cost: €1 to tour the palace; €8.50 for the palace, gardens, and the Musical Gardens and Musical Fountain Shows Museum Pass: The Museum Pass covers your entry into the palace, the Trianon, and the Queen's Hamlet. It does not cover the Musical Gardens. You will have to purchase this ticket separately (and you should do so in advance) for €10.50. Before you visit Versailles, you will need to book a free time slot to enter. Learn more here. Getting here: Take RER C from Paris to Versailles. This journey takes approximately 45 minutes. If you purchase the Paris Visite Pass (a transportation card) it covers the RER to and from Versailles. Powered by GetYourGuide Options for your Afternoon in Paris If you do not spend all day in Versailles and get back to Paris during the afternoon, here are several spots to visit. Take in the View from Montparnasse For one of the best views of Paris, visit the observation deck of Montparnasse Tower. There are two levels to visit, the 56th floor, which is completely enclosed by windows, and the observation terrace on the roof. This is also completely enclosed by glass panels but there are a few strategic openings in the glass for your camera. View from Montparnasse Hours & Price: www.tourmontparnasse56. Com You can also reserve a roof top ticket with GetYourGuide. Note: If you want to eat some of the best crepes in Paris, walk 5 minutes to La Creperie de Josselin (11 am -11:30 pm, closed Monday and Tuesday). Take Your Pick from 2 Museums Rodin Museum This small museum features sculptures by Rodin. It's quick and fun to visit. If you are traveling with kids, this is a museum they may actually like. Just ask them to pose like the statues. Rodin Museum Website: Get hours and pricing on the official website. RER: Invalides (line C) - perfect for taking the RER back to Paris from Versailles Metro: Varenne (line 13) and Invalides (line 8 and 13) Centre Pompidou This is the largest modern art museum in Europe. It has an interesting design, with all of its plumbing and pipes located on the exterior of the museum, color-coded in vibrant colors. It's definitely a unique sight to see. This is large museum and you could wander here for hours. From the top level of the museum you are treated to another wonderful view of Paris. Pompidou Centre Website: Get hours and pricing on the official website. Metro: Rambuteau (line 11), Hotel de Ville (line 1 and 11), Chatelet (line 1, 4, 7, 11, and 14) Visit the Catacombs Descend under the streets of Paris and tour the labyrinth of tunnels lined with human bones. In the 18th century, cemeteries around Paris were cleared and the bones were moved to these underground tunnels. Now, this is the final resting place of six million Parisians. Paris Catacombs The Catacombs can have one of the longest lines in all of Paris. Waiting times can be as long as 3 hours. Only 200 people are permitted in the Catacombs at one time, so the line moves very slowly. Booking a ticket in advance is now mandatory and you can do so on the official Catacombs website (€31) or join a skip-the-line tour. The Catacombs are open Tuesday through Sunday from 9:45 am to 8:30 pm, last admission at 7:30 pm. The least crowded time of day to visit the Catacombs is the last two hours of the day. Visit Père Lachaise Cemetery Père Lachaise Cemetery is one of the best known and most visited cemeteries in the world. A visit here may sound like a macabre way to spend an afternoon, but a stroll among the tombstones and mausoleums can be fascinating. Père Lachaise Père Lachaise is free to visit but if you want to get more out of the experience, you can take a guided tour. Hours: Daily 8:00 am to 5:30 pm; on Saturday it opens at 8:30 am Cost: Free Metro: Pere Lachaise Line 2 and 3 Dinner and Drinks in Le Marais End the day with a visit to Le Marais, one of Paris' most interesting neighborhoods. If you are looking for a budget meal, consider trying one of the falafel restaurants along Rue de Rosiers. The most famous spot is L'As du Falafel. We ate at Mi-Va-Mi, another popular spot, simply because it was the only one open during our visit. If you don't feel like eating falafel on your last night in Paris, there are many great cafes and restaurants in the area. Tips to Help You Have the Best Experience Learn a Little French Sure, you can get by with just speaking English, but being able to say a few things in French is polite and friendly. At a bare minimum, say bonjour when walking into a restaurant or shop. If it's evening, say bonsoir. In my experience, trying to speak the local language opens you up to much more meaningful interactions with people. Even if you are not perfect or you make a mistake, your effort is appreciated. I am a big fan of Fluenz, a software program that teaches several different languages and is perfect if you want to learn a little bit of conversational French. Beware of Pickpockets Paris is very safe. Your chances of being a victim of violent crime are very low. However, pickpocketing is a problem in Paris. Our hotel staff warned us of pickpockets and this article by Europe for Visitors has a lot of great tips that you should read, especially if this is your first time to Europe. Museum Closings on Mondays and Tuesdays Several museums close on either Monday or Tuesday. Take note of this when planning your trip. You may have to adjust the order of these three days if you will be in Paris on a Monday or Tuesday. Closed on Monday: Musee d'Orsay Versailles Musee Rodin Closed on Tuesday: Louvre Musee de l'Orangerie Pompidou Centre Places that are closed on Monday will have larger than normal crowds on Sunday and Tuesday. Places that are closed on Tuesday will have larger crowds on Monday and Wednesday. This is just something to be aware of when planning your time. How to Adjust this 3 Days in Paris Itinerary If day one of your three days in Paris also happens to be the day that you are arriving in the city, you will need to adjust day 1 of this Paris itinerary. Even if you arrive in the morning, there's a good chance that you will be exhausted, especially if you flew a red-eye flight from outside of Europe. Out of the big sites on day 1 (Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and the Arc de Triomphe) you may just want to plan on visiting two of them and save the third site for the afternoon of day 3. If you only have 2 days in Paris, check out our 2 Days in Paris Itinerary to learn how to plan your time. Should You Get the Museum Pass? Absolutely! The Museum Pass covers your entrance fee into almost every site in this itinerary and it allows you to skip the ticket lines. Just be aware that it does not guarantee getting into every attraction without a line. During busy times, you still may have to queue for security. The Museum Pass is only offered for 2 days (€70), 4 days (€90), and 6 days (€110). They do not have a 3-day option. I recommend getting the 4-day pass. If you visit everything I have listed (not including the optional museums on day 3), you will pay €107.50. Even though you don't use the pass all four days, you still save €17.50. If you visit another museum on the afternoon of day 3, that's an additional €13 to €14 savings. Click here for full more information and instructions on how to obtain your pass. What About the Paris Pass? You may also hear about something called the Paris Pass. The 4-day pass includes the 4-day Museum Pass but this costs €54. It includes many attractions and tours, most of which are not listed on our itinerary. Unless you also plan on taking the hop-on hop-off bus tour, a walking tour, a Seine River cruise, and visiting places like the Paris Aquarium, you will not get your money's worth. Our Recommendation Purchase the 4-day Museum Pass for €90 and a travel card that gives you unlimited rides on the metro, buses, etc.. There are several travel cards available. The Paris Visite Pass gives you unlimited rides on the metro, bus, RER, trams, and Montmarte funicular within a specific window of time. The Paris Visite pass can be purchased for 1, 2, 3, or 5 days. It includes all 5 zones, including the Paris city center, Charles de Gualle airport, Orly Airport, the Palace of Versailles, and Disneyland. A 1-day pass costs €9.90, a 2-day pass costs €44.45, and a 3-day pass costs €62.30. The Paris Navigo Pass is a travel card that is used by locals in Paris. If you will be in Paris for several days, it might be cheaper than the Paris Visite pass. The Navigo pass gives you unlimited rides on the metro, bus, RER, trams, and Montmartre funicular. It costs €5 to purchase the card and then there is a weekly fare (€31.60 for zones 1-5). The period of validity for the Paris Navigo Pass is sold in weeks (valid from Monday through Sunday). If your visit crosses over this period (for example, if you will be in Paris from Sunday through Tuesday) you will need two of these weekly fares, so the prices are similar to a Visite pass. You can purchase your Paris Visite Pass or Navigo Pass at the ticket booths in the metro stations (do this the first time you ride the metro). This will pay for your transportation on the metro, RER, bus, and the Montmartre funicular and will cover your trip to and from Versailles on the RER. Make Your Reservations in Advance Here are the attractions where we highly recommend making a reservation in advance, plus the link to the official website and GetYourGuide, just to make things a bit easier for you. GetYourGuide offers some advantages over the official websites. For some attractions, GetYourGuide tickets and tours can be cancelled up to 24 hours in advance and you get a full refund (but it's good to double check this, because there are exceptions). Any GYG tours and tickets you purchase are stored on their app, making it easier to organize your tickets in one spot. Finally, if you use GetYourGuide, you will load your credit card information into one website, rather than the long list below. We use GetYourGuide when we travel and have had nothing but positive experiences. Eiffel Tower: Official website - GetYourGuide The Louvre: Official website - GetYourGuide Arc de Triomphe: Official website - GetYourGuide Seine River Cruise: GetYourGuide Sainte-Chapelle & the Conciergerie: Official website - GetYourGuide Notre Dame Cathedral: Official website Musée d'Orsay: Official website - GetYourGuide The Palace and Gardens of Versailles: Official website - GetYourGuide If you plan to visit the Catacombs, the Pompidou Centre, or the Rodin Museum on the afternoon of day 3, we also recommend purchasing these tickets in advance. And of course, don't forget to make your dinner reservations. Check out our Paris Restaurants and Rooftop Bars for recommendations. Note: If you have the Museum Pass, you do not need to purchase tickets for the Louvre, the Arc de Triomphe, Sainte-Chapelle, the Conciergerie, Musée d'Orsay, the Palace of Versailles. However, you will need to reserve a time slot for the Louvre, Sainte-Chapelle, and the Conciergerie. Planning Your Trip In our Paris Travel guide, we cover everything you need to know to plan a trip to Paris. This includes must-see sights, more sample itineraries, where to stay, where to eat, rooftop bars with panoramic views of Paris, plus the logistics that come with planning your trip. Paris Travel Guide How to Plan a Trip to Paris: Tips & Itineraries for Your First Visit Everything you need to know to plan your dream trip to Paris. Best Time to Visit Paris In general, spring and fall are the best times of the year to visit Paris. During this time, the weather is great for sightseeing and crowds tend to be lower than the busy summer months. But here is a breakdown by season of what you can expect in Paris: WINTER: Paris is cold during the winter months, with average high's ranging from 5 to 7°C (mid-40's Fahrenheit) and the average low hovering just above freezing. Rainfall is slightly higher than most of the other seasons, with Paris getting about 8 days of rainfall per month in the winter. Skies tend to be overcast on a regular basis. SPRING: The spring brings warmer temperatures and clearer skies. In early April, the average high temperature is still on the cooler side (about 16°C or 60°F). The average high in May is 19°C (66°F) but it can be much warmer than this, on unusually warm days. April is a beautiful month to visit Paris, when the trees begin getting leaves and flowers are in bloom. SUMMER: Summers are warm with sunny skies. The average high is 24°C (76°F) but during a heat wave, it can get up to 38°C (100°F). This doesn't happen every year, but it is a possibility. Crowds are at their highest during the summer. FALL: In fall, the weather turns cooler and rain chances increase slightly over the summer months. October is another beautiful month to visit Paris, with cool weather and a hint of fall colors. VERDICT: Our favorite months to visit Paris are April and October. The weather is wonderful and crowds aren't at their peak levels. Where to Stay in Paris We have visited Paris four times. These are hotels we recommend, either because we had a great experience or because they have a prime location and an excellent review score. Hotel Brighton. This is where we stayed on our first trip to Paris and we still talk about this hotel. Over the years, we have recommended this hotel to other family, friends, and readers of this website, and they have all had very similar, memorable experiences. Located on Rue de Rivoli right across from Tuileries Garden, you will be able to see the Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral, the Eiffel Tower, and the Arc de Triomphe from your room. Request a high floor, preferably one with a balcony, for the best experience. Le Relais Saint Honoré. We stayed in this lovely, mid-range hotel on our 3rd visit to Paris. Our favorite thing about this small, boutique hotel is its excellent location. The Louvre, Tuileries Garden, Place de la Concorde, and Palais-Garnier are all within a 10-minute walk. The Tuileries and Pyramides metro stations are less than 5 minutes away. The rooms are small but tastefully decorated and the staff is friendly and speaks English. You don't get the awesome view in this hotel but we loved the friendly staff and the location. Apartments Du Louvre. If you are family, small group, or simply prefer an apartment over a hotel room, Apartments Du Louvre has several great options. This small property offers one, two, and three-bedroom apartments that come with a kitchen, air conditioning, and most rooms have city views. This property is located in the 2 nd arrondissement, just steps away from Le Marais, within walking distance of the Louvre, and a short walk to several of Paris' handiest metro stations. Hôtel Le Presbytère. This 3-star hotelhas it all: beautifully decorated rooms, a prime location, excellent review score, plus it even offers a Junior Suite that can accommodate up to 5 people, perfect for families. It is located in the southwest corner of Le Marais, just steps away from Notre Dame, the Louvre, and Châtelet, one of the best metro hubs in the city. If you are a family traveling on a budget and want to stay in the heart of Paris near the top attractions, this is a great hotel to consider.

Frequently Asked Questions How many days do you need in Paris? Ideally, plan on spending at least three days in Paris. This gives you just enough time to visit the highlights, explore a few neighborhoods, and dine at a few restaurants. If you have three days, take a look at our 3 Day Paris Itinerary. With 2 days in Paris, you can see the main highlights in two very busy days. It will be a whirlwind of a visit and booking your entrance tickets in advance will be key in maximizing your time, but what an amazing 2 days it will be! What is the best way to get around Paris? The Paris metro is cheap, fast, and very efficient. While in the city center, you are never more than a 5-minute walk from a metro station. It costs roughly €18 per day for unlimited rides on the metro, so you can travel around Paris without spending a lot of money. I recommend the Paris Metro Map and Routes app (available for free in the Apple App Store) or something similar, which gives you real-time schedules and helps plan your metro routes through the city. Is Paris expensive to visit? Yes, Paris can be expensive to visit, if you stay in 5-star hotels and dine at Michelin starred restaurants. But you can also have a great experience and visit Paris' top sights with some money saving tricks. There are plenty of highly rated hostels and budget hotels to help keep accommodation costs low. Rather than dining at restaurants, put together picnic lunches and dinners at the market. Purchase the Museum Pass to visit the attractions with a discount and skip the ticket line. Riding the metro is very budget friendly. Without splurging on meals or accommodations, it is possible to tour Paris for €100 per person per day. Happy travels!

The best Paris itineraries regardless of how long you are staying in Paris. Unlike most Paris itineraries, my Paris itinerary planner includes alternatives to consider, and how to plan a trip to Paris with children or if you have special interests. Over future posts, I'll be covering the best Paris itineraries for one, two, three, five or seven days. Regardless of your budget and how long you are spending in Paris, my Paris itinerary series will help you plan your trip to Paris to maximise your time in Paris. To kick off the series, I'm discussing visiting Paris in a day. While a one day trip to Paris is not ideal, and there is certainly little opportunity to check out all the best Paris Instagram spots it is still possible to hit a number of the big ticket items and have a fun day during a day trip in Paris. This post contains affiliate links. As an Amazon associate I earn from qualifying purchases. Click here to read my full disclosure Table Of Contents What to buy on a one day visit to Paris Where to eat when you visit Paris in one day If you prefer a guided tour, it is possible to book Paris in a day guided tours. I recommend the excellent Take Walks: Start off at Notre Dame Cathedral. While Notre Dame remains closed you can still take in its grandeur from the outside. It is also possible to do an interactive virtual visit. Depending on what time you leave Notre Dame, you can either go to Shakespeare & Co. (opens at 10.00am Monday to Friday and 11am on weekends) or Ste Chapelle (opens at 9.30am). If you are super early in starting your day, or don't want to linger long at Notre Dame you will have plenty of time to admire the river views. Turn left from the Notre Dame courtyard, then walk towards the back of the cathedral. At the end of the island (Ile de la Cité) there are some lovely views back over the Ile St Louis and the Left Bank. Then take the first bridge (more lovely views back over Notre Dame and the river) and enjoy a wander along to Shakespeare & Co. Shakespeare & Co is probably the most famous book shop in Paris. Even if books aren't your thing it's a pretty shop to enjoy from the outside. If you are looking for some cheap and easy gifts or souvenirs, the last time I visited Shakespeare & Co they were selling cute calico book bags for a few Euros each. After your visit to Shakespeare & Co continue left out of the shop (therefore heading west) towards Place St Michel, and cross the Pont St Michel where Sainte Chapelle will be right in front of you on the left. If you haven't bought your Museum Pass or skip the lines ticket you can buy a Museum Pass at the tabac at 5 bvde du Palais. It is likely you will need to queue at Ste Chapelle, regardless of what time you get there. The first queue will be for security, which you will need to queue for even with a pass. If you have a Museum Pass or skip the line ticket (you can buy Paris skip the line tickets here) you can then go in without queuing at the second queue to buy a ticket. The interior of Ste Chapelle Ste Chapelle is certainly one of my favorite places to visit in Paris, so do make sure you spend plenty of time enjoying its tiny details (both up and downstairs). The Ultimate Paris Address Book 2024 is your insider address book to Paris with 100 pages and 500 places to sleep, eat, shop and see. Listed by arrondissement, The Ultimate Paris Address Book 2024 is the perfect accompaniment to a traditional guide book to plan your trip to Paris. From where to find a charming country lane in the middle of Paris to ice cream and chocolates from a multi Michelin starred legend, The Ultimate Paris Address Book will help you say au revoir to the tourist traps and bonjour to the real Paris. Buy your copy now >> After Ste Chapelle it's a very short stroll to the Conciergerie. The Conciergerie is famous for its time as a prison during the French Revolution. While it was the final home of many aristocrats it is most famous for being where Marie Antoinette was imprisoned. I like the Conciergerie because of its starkness and austerity compared to its neighbour Ste Chapelle. There are some interesting documents and artifacts, as well as Revolution scene recreations, which makes the Conciergerie an interesting place to visit, particularly for those interested in history. Our next stop is the Louvre. To reach the Louvre from the Conciergerie, turn left out of the Conciergerie and continue left again staying on the Ile de la Cité until you come to an \"old\" looking bridge on your right. This is the Pont Neuf, or new bridge, actually one of the oldest bridges in Paris. Cross the bridge, again, taking time to enjoy the views as you cross. Then turn left and continue on. The Louvre is on your right just near the next bridge (the Pont des Arts). There are multiple entrances into the Louvre courtyards and its main entrance at the Pyramid. If there is a queue at the Pyramid (and there may well be), never fear. There are far less crowded entrances if you have a Museum Pass at the Museum Pass/Group Entrance in the Pavilion Richelieu (under the arches between the Pyramid and the rue de Rivoli) or at the underground Mall entrance (accessed via the Carrousel de Louvre shopping mall on rue de Rivoli). Unless you have a Museum or Paris Pass you must book a timed entry ticket for the Louvre. Are you planning a trip to France? My France Travel Planning Facebook group is a vibrant and friendly group where you can ask questions, learn from others and get great advice. You can join here >> It's easy to spend more than a day in the Louvre, so with only a one day visit to Paris having a plan to make the most of your visit to the Louvre is key. Study your guidebook well (there are some good choices available at the end of this post) and then grab an English language Information Guide at the information desk under the Pyramid. You will need to check your bag if it is larger than a small handbag/purse. Most visitors will spend about 2hours on a basic tour of the Louvre regardless of whether you are on a 1 day Paris itinerary or are staying longer. Adjust your time according to your level of interest (or the weather). Allow a little extra time if you choose to eat in one of the museum cafés or shop at the Louvre shop. Leave the Louvre via the Pyramid exit and cross the road to enter the Tuileries garden. The Tuileries is a perfect spot to do some people watching and enjoy a little picnic late lunch or afternoon tea (choose something to take away from one of the Louvre cafés or buy something sweet across the road at Angelina's on rue de Rivoli. From the Tuileries it's a short Metro trip to the Trocadero to enjoy the views of the Eiffel Tower before you go up. Again, avoid the worst of the queues by purchasing a skip the queue ticket. Purchase your Eiffel Tower skip the line ticket here >> What to buy on a one day visit to Paris Unless you take my Paris one day tour shopping itinerary below, you won't have much opportunity for shopping on this itinerary unfortunately. While there are plenty of souvenir shops and stands at all the places on my itinerary, I'm suggesting you pass on them. Instead, the Louvre has a lovely shop with a range of goods from a Euro or so up to thousands of Euros for some of the very special pieces. On rue de Rivoli just opposite the Tuileries you can choose from a range of food items at Angelina's (perfect for a snack on the way home at the end of the day) or just along the street from Angelina's is a large book shop with an excellent range of English books about Paris and French culture. Where to eat when you visit Paris in one day Again, there are plenty of food choices on this itinerary. Some are good, some are terrible. For reliable food at a reasonable price buy something at a bakery or patisserie and picnic, or eat at the Louvre. There are plenty of fast food options around Notre Dame and Ste Chapelle. Just don't expect them to be particularly cheap or particularly French. My Ultimate Paris Address Book ebook also features a range of restaurants in this part of Paris. You can pick up your copy here >> One day Paris itinerary with children Paris is an easy destination with little ones and my basic one day trip to Paris is easily adapted to accommodate children. Rather than starting at Notre Dame I would start at the Eiffel Tower, then take the bateaux mouches down to Notre Dame. It's a fun, relaxing way to visit Paris in a day. If your children are a little older and are interested in animals, dinosaurs and science, stay on the bateau mouche past Notre Dame and go to the Natural History Museum. There are a lot of animals preserved in jars, which younger children may find a bit confronting. We took MissG when she was six without any problems though. With this option, skip the Conciergerie and save some time by making your Ste Chapelle visit a little shorter. Then end your day with a short visit to the Louvre and a longer visit to the Tuileries for a run around Book you bateaux mouches tickets here >> One day in Paris: itinerary for the art lover This itinerary can easily be adapted for the art lover even if you only have one day to spend in Paris. Forget everything else except the Louvre and the Musée d'Orsay. Spend half a day in each. Even the building at the Musee d'Orsay is artistic Or for a really special day, visit Ste Chapelle (it really is a work of art), the Louvre and the Orsay. If you have the option of visiting Paris on a day where these are open late you can spend a very enjoyable long day indulging your passion. If more modern art is your thing, pick one out of the Orsay and the Louvre, and then spend the rest of your day at the Pompidou Centre (not far from the Louvre, so works best if you pass on the Orsay). Book your Paris Museum tickets here >> One day Paris itinerary for the garden lover Those who love gardens can still enjoy a day in Paris without spending all day travelling around town. Instead of going to the Conciergerie, after you've been to St Chapelle cross the road and head down rue de Lutece. At the end of the street on the left is the sweetest flower market and nursery (on Sundays this market is a bird market). Obviously amend your time to accommodate a nice long visit to the Tuileries, or head north from the Tuileries and visit the gardens at the Palais Royale (only about 5minutes north of the Louvre). Although they look like private gardens, they are open to the public and are truly lovely. While it works better on a two day trip to Paris, if a visit to Giverny is a must do, and you only have one day in Paris, it is possible to visit Giverny as a one day trip from Paris. Catch an early train from the Gare St Lazare to arrive at Giverny as close to opening time as possible. When you board the navette (the little bus that takes you from the station to Giverny) pick up a timetable for your return. Resist the temptation to spend ages in the gift shop (it's terribly expensive apart from anything else) and enjoy your visit to the house and gardens. Assuming the gardens are not too busy, you can possibly be back in Paris in the early to mid afternoon if you bypass the village. Then resume your visit to Paris. This itinerary works best if you travel independently rather than doing an organised trip. One day Paris itinerary for the food lover There are plenty of food options available on my one day itinerary for Paris, but not a lot of gourmet or special options. Book a table at Angelina's in advance and enjoy lunch or afternoon tea. There are other nearby restaurant options in my Ultimate Paris Address Book ebook. You can buy your copy here >> My other suggested food option is to plan the order of your day to be in the Eiffel Tower area at meal time (a late afternoon/early evening visit to the Tower, then dinner would work well for example). A few blocks away from the Eiffel Tower are plenty of good French restaurants at reasonable prices in the rue St Dominique/rue Cler neighbourhood. If you are interested in this option, I strongly suggest the Rick Steves Paris guide. Rick Steves' Paris itinerary covers the rue Cler neighbourhood in some detail: #1 best seller Rick Steves Paris (Travel Guide) Buy on Amazon Prices pulled from the Amazon Product Advertising API on: Product prices and availability are accurate as of the date/time indicated and are subject to change.

For a very special Paris meal, book a table at Jules Verne at the Eiffel Tower (needs to be booked months in advance), or try Atelier de Joel Robuchon in the nearby 6th arrondissement. While my 1 day trip to Paris itinerary is focussed on sightseeing, and there are so many places to visit in one day, I know some people will just want to shop. For a day or half day's shopping in Paris as part of a one day trip to Paris, I'm suggesting staying on the Right Bank and either hit the Grands Magasins - Au Printemps and Galeries Lafayettes or the Marais. The passages in the area north of the Louvre heading up as far as Boulevarde Haussman have some interesting small shops and make a good alternative to the Marais if it is raining. The Grands Magasins are definitely your best bet if you want to shop in Paris on a Sunday. If you are staying in Paris for longer, you can read my 3 day Paris itinerary here."}]}

Paris is one of my favourite cities in the world and I've been there many times - more than a dozen at this point! My trips have ranged from one day in Paris to two weeks, and I know the city pretty well at this point. I've used that passion and knowledge to devise an itinerary that covers the best of Paris in 4 days. With this itinerary, you'll see the most impressive Paris landmarks, admire priceless works of art, explore charming neighbourhoods - and, of course, eat delicious French cuisine. I'll also show you a few places that are off the beaten path. Read on for all the information and inspiration you need to book the perfect Paris itinerary.

Table of Contents Toggle About This Itinerary For 4 Days In Paris This is actually the second 4-day Paris itinerary I have written. I wrote one for solo travellers in this post on solo travel in Paris. There are some similarities between the two itineraries, but I wrote this one from scratch, not looking at the first one (it had been a while since I wrote it, and I've been to Paris a couple more times since), so it is different. However, feel free to check out the other one for an alternative to this one. Things to note about this itinerary for 4 days in Paris: It's pretty busy! I have assumed you'll want to make the most of only a few days in Paris, so I have created a fairly full itinerary, with several things to do in the mornings and afternoons each day. It involves a fair bit of walking. A large part of Paris's appeal, for me, is in the beauty and discovery to be found in the streets of Paris. You'll want comfortable shoes (no one wears fancy shoes in Paris anyway - that's only in movies and on TV). I do suggest you use the Metro. I don't think you can walk everywhere in Paris, so follow the tips for using the Metro that I will give you at the end of this itinerary. It's all in Paris. There are some great day trips from Paris, including to the Palace of Versailles and Reims. But with only four days in Paris, I suggest you stick to the city and leave the day trips for a longer visit. Quite a few activities are outdoors, so if your weather forecast is very rainy or cold, you might want to check my post about Paris in winter, which has ideas of things to do in Paris when the weather is bad - it might be you need to swap out some of the outdoor things in this Paris itinerary for more indoor things. Book attractions in advance: in order to guarantee you can do them, you will want to book some of the popular activities in advance. I'll circle back to what these are, with links, at the end. Itinerary For 4 Days In Paris - In A Nutshell OK, here's a very high-level overview of what I recommend in this itinerary for 4 days in Paris: Day 1: Eiffel Tower & The Sights Of The Seine - including Notre-Dame cathedral and Musée d'Orsay. Day 2: The Intellectual Left Bank - including Saint-Germain, Jardin du Luxembourg & the Latin Quarter. Day 3: Shopping, Gold Leaf & Cobble Streets - covered passages, Les Grands Magasins, Palais Garnier & Montmartre. Day 4: Grand Old Paris - Le Marais, the Louvre, Petit Palais and Arc de Triomphe for a showstopper finale. Itinerary For 4 Days In Paris - in Detail Now, let's get into the details of this epic itinerary for 4 days in Paris. Day 1 - Eiffel Tower & The Sights Of The Seine I suggest you focus on the major sights around the Seine on your first day in Paris. This does make this a rather expensive day, as there are several attractions to pay for. But the later days in this itinerary are cheaper, don't worry! Morning Trocadéro We're going to start with the Eiffel Tower, because, well, you just have to. It's the law in Paris, I think. But before actually climbing the tower, I suggest you start with a view of it. Trocadéro at dawn Start as early in the day as you can and take the Metro to Trocadéro, which is an elevated plaza, with a sweeping view of Paris, dominated by the Eiffel Tower. It's a popular, busy spot (there will likely be several amateur photo shoots happening!), but the light is just gorgeous at sunrise. Once you've had your fill of the view, take down the steps to the right of the fountains and wander down the path towards the Eiffel Tower. If you come to Paris in Spring, you'll have the added bonus of cherry blossoms in bloom in the gardens. In fact, this is one of the best places to see cherry blossoms in Paris. Trocadéro Gardens The Eiffel Tower Cross the Seine at Pont d'Iéna and head to the tower to get a closer look. The Eiffel Tower is the most recognisable and enduring icon of Paris, so it's funny to think that there was opposition to it when it was first built in 1889. One derisory commentator called it a 'truly tragic street lamp'! It was built for the 1889 World's Fair and at 330 meters high, it set a record as the world's highest monument. If you want to go up the tower, you'll want to book tickets in advance and can choose between various options including climbing the stairs, summit access and a guided tour. I've done the stair-climb to the first level and also the view from the summit, which is pretty cool (but can be chilly!). Rue de l'Université & the Eiffel Tower in the morning sun If you prefer to stay on the ground, the Champs de Mars gardens around the tower offer plenty of different vantage points. There's also a classic photo op spot on Rue de l'Université. Seine Boat Tour - Batobus Once you've had your fill of the famous iron tower, head back towards the river because your next activity is a boat ride on the Seine ! A Batobus on the Seine There are lots of different kinds of Seine River tours available, and I've done a few. The one I recommend for this itinerary is Batobus Paris - because it's good value for money and really flexible. Batobus is kind of like a river bus. The way it works is there are boats continually making a circuit of the river, stopping at various points along the way. If you have a ticket, you can hop on and hop off as many times as you like, for as long as your ticket is valid (tickets are for 1 day or 2 days). I recommend you buy a one-day Batobus pass, which you can do online via Get Your Guide, and start by taking the boat from the Eiffel Tower stop to Notre Dame. This stretch of the route takes you past some stunning landmarks along the Seine, including Pont Alexandre III, Musée d'Orsay, Institut de France and Pont Neuf. The Seine It will take about 45 minutes from the Eiffel Tower to get to Notre Dame - and heads up, there are no toilets on board. But don't worry, there is a good (though not free, it costs €) place to use the loo when you get to Notre Dame. Read more about what you can see at each of the nine Batobus Paris stops. Cathedral de Notre Dame Paris's most famous church is in the heart of the old part of Paris: Île de la Cité the largest island in the Seine. Notre Dame was built in the 12 th and 13 th centuries and renovated significantly in the 19 th Century (after it faced calls to be demolished, which thankfully were overruled). It remains one of the best examples of Gothic architecture in Paris. Recently re-opened to the public after a 5-year renovation following a fore in 2019, it's free to visit the cathedral, but you'll need to reserve a spot on their official website. You can also take guided tours. Cathedral de Notre Dame Lunch For lunch, I suggest grabbing a crêpe from one of the food stalls near Notre Dame - there's always one there and the crêpes and delicious and filling. There are plenty of restaurants just across the river on the left bank, but so many of them look like tourist traps and have bad online ratings - so I tend to avoid them. Afternoon Sainte-Chapelle There's also another Gothic church you can visit nearby on Île de la Cité: Sainte-Chapelle. This church was built in 1248 to house the relic of Christ's Crown of Thorns and is known for its spectacular stained-glass windows. If there's one church in Paris that you go inside, make it this one: the interior is just stunning! There are just two parts to the chapel, so it doesn't take long to view. The tall colourful windows and star-strewn midnight blue ceiling are really something special. Sainte-Chapelle Seine Boat Tour Continues - Batobus If you want, from here, you could wander into the Left Bank and explore more of the old Paris: the Latin Quarter. But I suggest you do that another day - and instead, make the most of your Batobus ticket by getting back on a boat. Because the Batobus route is like a very elongated circle, if you catch another boat at Notre Dame, it will continue in the direction you were going before, east toward Jardin des Plantes stop, where it will turn around, and head back down the river, this time staying close to the right bank. Along this stretch of the river, look out for Île Saint-Louis, the medieval towers of the Conciergerie and The Louvre. Conciergerie (on the left) To get to your next stop, Musée d'Orsay, you can stay on the boat even after it gets to the Eiffel Tower and turns around - and then get off right at the Musée d'Orsay stop. This stretch of the Batobus route should take about an hour and 25 minutes. Or, an alternative is you could get off at the Louvre stop, and then cross the river on Pont Royal to get to Musée d'Orsay on foot. This option takes only 40 minutes on the Batobus, plus a ten-minute walk. Musée d'Orsay This might be my favourite art gallery in Paris! I love its architecture. The Musée d'Orsay building was originally designed to be a train station - which makes sense when you see its cavernous atrium with an arched ceiling and ornate clock. The clock window on the top floor is also pretty special. And I really love the top floor collection of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings, including works by Monet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. There are so many treasures here. Musée d'Orsay Dinner After you're done at the Museum, you might be ready for some rich French food for dinner. I don't know anywhere near Musee D'Orsay, but one of the best traditional French bistros I have tried in Paris is Les Philosophes. If you're in Paris in summer, when the last river bus departs at 9:30 pm, you'll be able to get to Les Philosophes by Batobus (getting off at Hôtel de Ville stop), followed by a walk. It's a cute little place with a classic menu - perfect for ending your first day in Paris. French Onion soup at Les Philosophes I went full-on indulgence when I ate here: French onion soup to start, followed by Boeuf Bourguignon and Crème Brûlée to finish. When in France, right? Day 2 - The Intellectual Left Bank Day 2 of your itinerary for 4 days in Paris has fewer paid-for attractions and more walking, as you explore the intellectual Left Bank of Paris - 'where Paris learned to think'. Morning Jardin Du Luxembourg Start your day by having a peaceful wander in one of the nicest parks in Paris: Jardin du Luxembourg in the 6 th arrondissement. If you want a breakfast pastry to take with you, there are several options on rue de Fleuris. Luxembourg Gardens Highlights of Jardin Du Luxembourg to look out for: Luxembourg Palace, once a royal palace and home to the mother of King Louis XIII, Marie de Medici, is now used by the French government for the Senat (though you can still do tours of the palace). Medici Fountain, a monumental fountain built in 1630 (a very popular photo spot). Grand Bassin: the central pond, which has lots of metal chairs around it, which are perfect for lounging. Queens of France: many white marble statues of historical queens of France are set against the trees, facing into the basin. I really like these statues. A bandstand, that sometimes has live performances. Flower gardens, mainly in the west and south-west of the park. A miniature version of the Statue of Liberty, the original of which is in New York City Tennis courts & basketball courts. Whilst there's a lot here that is unequivocally beautiful, what I like most about this park is how it feels like part of the community. When I first came here, I sat on a bench and watched some people play tennis. And on my most recent visit to Paris, I loved seeing the people practise Tai Chi under the trees in the mornings. It has a very chill vibe. Saint-Germain-des-Prés After exploring Luxembourg Gardens, head north towards Saint-Germain-des-Prés. On the way along Rue Bonaparte, you'll pass the impressively large and oddly uneven church Église Saint-Sulpice. The non-matching towers of Église Saint-Sulpice Saint-Germain-des-Prés is known best for the intellectuals who gathered here in the 1950s and 60s. At that time, this neighbourhood became a hub for writers, filmmakers, musicians and thinkers, including philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir and filmmakers Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut. Here you'll also find Paris's oldest church, Eglise de Saint-Germain-des-Prés. It dates from the 6 th century and was once a crypt for the kings of France. The church contains the tomb of René Descartes, an important 17th-century philosopher, scientist and mathematician. Lunch Grab lunch at one of the iconic Saint-Germain cafés, where those intellectuals would meet and debate: Les Deux Magots and Café de Flore. Heads up: these cafes are pricey and you might need to queue for a table, but they're such classic Parisian cafes, I think it's worth it. Classic Parisian cafe, Les Deux Magots Afternoon Latin Quarter After lunch, wander east and into the Latin Quarter. I promised we'd come back to it, didn't it? On the way, pop your head into Cr du Commerce Saint-André, one of the oldest covered passages of Paris, where you can still see the original cobblestones - now very uneven. The Latin Quarter takes its name from the language taught in schools here in the middle ages and it is one of the oldest districts in the city. Take your time exploring this area during the afternoon, stopping in cafes as often as you need (it's the Parisian way). Odette Jardin des Plantes Take your pick from the Latin Quarter highlights, which include: Rue du Chat Qui Pêche is the narrowest street in Paris and a reminder of how Paris's streets used to be before the widespread Haussmann redesign in the 19th Century. Near the river, there are some very quaint establishments including Shakespeare & Company bookshop, Abbey Bookshop and Odette Café, which has a great view of Notre Dame. Square René Viviani is a cute square near Shakespeare & Company. Sorbonne University, which was founded in the 13th century. Panthéon - a huge, imposing church that houses the remains of author Victor Hugo. Arab World Institute - an exhibition of Arabic culture, housed in a modern building with attractive decorative windows. Grand Mosque of Paris, which you can tour to enjoy the tiled gardens. Jardin des Plantes - extensive and impressive botanical gardens near the Natural History museum (Grande galerie de l'évolution). This garden a good place to chill if your feet need a rest. It's also another good place to see cherry blossoms in Paris in April. Collège des Bernardins - a bright airy example of Gothic architecture. Rue Mouffetard - a long road that dates from Roman times, with lots of great places to eat along it. Collège des Bernardins Arab World Institute Old & New in the Latin Quarter Dinner There's a great restaurant at the end of Rue Mouffetard and I really enjoyed my food there. Cave La Bourgogne has a rustic wooden interior and a simple but delicious menu. I had salmon, served with rice - the fish was tender, sweet and delicious. Cave La Bourgogne It's a good place to have a relaxed, low-key dinner to end your second day in Paris. Day 3 - Shopping, Gold Leaf & Cobble Streets Day 3 of this itinerary for 4 days in Paris will give you a flavour of two historical ways to shop in Paris: the covered passages of early-mid the 19 th century and the grands magasins (department stores) that became popular in the late 19 th Century. We'll also visit the ostentatious Paris Opera and explore the villagey cobbled streets of Montmartre. And on the shopping thing: if you want to shop, you can. But if you're not interested, that's also fine: the main attraction for me is actually the architecture of these stores. Morning Covered Passages The covered passages of Paris are one of my favourite features of the city - so much so that I have visited every single one! I feel like this makes me qualified to recommend visiting a couple of them during your trip. In the early to mid-19 th century, covered passages were built in Paris as a more pleasant shopping experience for wealthy patrons than the dirty Paris streets. These passages couverts were pedestrian walkways with shops and cafes, protected from the elements by vaulted ceilings, typically made of iron and glass. By around 1850, there were over 150 of them, but then the ambitious Haussmann redesign of Paris came and the creation of new boulevards and mansion buildings destroyed many of them. I suggest a visit to 2-3 of my favourite covered passages: Passages Verdeau, Jouffroy and Panoramas run on from one another, so you could enjoy them one after the other. Passage des Panoramas Passage Verdeau All three have an old-world charm and contain quaint independent shops and cafes. They also each have a slight speciality: Passage Verdeau for art shops & rare books; Passage Jouffroy for rare books and prints and Passage des Panoramas for vintage stamps and other collectable shops. For more info on each of them (and all the other covered passages), check my comprehensive guide to the best covered passages of Paris. Palais Garnier It's a 10-15 minute walk from Passage des Panoramas to Palais Garnier (also called Opéra Garnier), one of the grandest, most ostentatious buildings in Paris. It's impressive from the outside, displayed proudly at the end of Avenue de l'Opéra. But the real treat, in my opinion, is the interior, which has elegant twisting staircases, ornate balconies, mosaics and an intensely opulent Grand Foyer. This long hall is festooned with painted panels, chandeliers and gold leaf. Grand Foyer Palais Garnier stairway Palais Garnier is a working opera house, so you could have the full experience by going to an opera performance. However, for less money, you can also do self-guided or guided tours of the Palais Garnier interior during the day. It's very cool to explore this historic, opera house, which was built in 1875 and is perhaps most famous for being the setting of The Phantom of the Opera. Galeries Lafayette Palais Garnier is just across the street from your next stop: another showpiece of fancy Paris architecture: Galeries Lafayette. There are several old department stores (or grands magasins) in Paris and Galeries Lafayette is the most interesting, in my opinion. There are a lot of luxury and designer brands on sale here, so you could do some shopping if that is your thing. However, the reason I have recommended a visit here is its two main attractions: the stained-glass cupola and the rooftop terrace. Galeries Lafayette's colourful and ornate cupula is just amazing - it's so extravagant! Stand in the middle of the cosmetics floor and look up to get a good view. Or find one of the balconies on the 2nd floor to appreciate the balconies that ring the atrium. And the rooftop terrace is one of the best free things to do in Paris: it has views of the Opera House, Boulevard Haussmann and, across the slate-grey rooftops, the Eiffel Tower. Galeries Lafayatte Lunch For lunch, I'm going to suggest another department store, one which neighbours Galeries Lafayette: Au Printemps. Galeries Lafayette does have a canteen on the floor below the rooftop terrace, but neither the food nor the experience is very good, in my opinion. Printemps has a couple of restaurants on the 8th floor of the menswear building with views and terrace access. I ate at La Reine Mer, which specialises in fish and seafood. Next door, there's Regain, which has a meat-focused menu. Whichever you choose, do go out onto the terrace, which wraps around the building. I love how close it is to the ornate blue and gold domes and the views down Boulevard Haussmann. Printemps view Afternoon Montmartre After lunch jump on the Metro to Anvers, to spend the afternoon in Montmartre. It's a popular place and tends to have plenty of tourists almost year-round (unless you're in Paris in winter). But there's a reason why it's so popular: it's really gorgeous! For that reason, I think it's worth a visit, even if it feels touristy in the most central areas. I suggest you stay here all afternoon, so you can take your time, stopping for drinks in cafes when you feel like it. Sacré-Cœur, Montmartre To help you explore the best of Montmartre, including some of the lesser-visited spots, I have created a free self-guided walking tour of Montmartre. This gives a manageable route that will take you to the main sights and prettiest streets, highlighting things to do along the way, plus places to eat. Montmartre highlights you'll discover on my walking tour include: Basilica of Sacré Cœur de Montmartre, the most elegant church in Paris. Place du Terte, the buzzing heart of Montmartre. La Maison Rose, arguably the most instagrammable café in Paris. Rue de l'Abreuvoir, one of the prettiest streets in Paris. Vigne du Clos Montmartre - a vineyard in Paris! Musée de Montmartre, a small museum in a historic building with lovely gardens - definitely worth a visit. Moulin de la Galette, the setting for a famous Renoir painting and home to one of the remaining Montmartre windmills (moulins). Rue Lepic, which winds around Montmartre. Le Consulat - another cute, historic cafe. Escalier du Calvaire - one of the many stairways around the butte of Montmartre (exploring Montmartre can be strenuous!) The Wall of Love, a modern monument to love. Cimetiere de Montmartre, where impressionist painter Edgar Degas, writers Emile Zola and Alexandre Dumas and the film director François Truffaut are entombed. Le Passe-Muraille Escaliers du Calvaire Rue de l'Abreuvoir Obviously, you could do a Montmartre guided tour instead of my self-guided tour of Montmartre. Don't worry, I won't take offence! Dinner For dinner, I recommend La Boite aux Lettres on Rue Lepic - this small and unpretentious bistro has an innovative menu with a focus on seasonal produce. If you can't get a table here, Moulin de la Galette has pretty good traditional French food. The menu at La Boite aux Lettres is seasonal. I ate fish with carrots three ways, which sounds like it would be awful - but it was delicious! After dinner, if you fancy it, consider catching a film at the retro Montmartre cinema, Studio 28 cinema. If you don't speak French, look for English language films marked 'VOST', which means they're in their original language, with subtitles in French. Day 4 - Grand Old Paris If you've followed this itinerary for 4 days in Paris, you will have seen a lot of Paris by now, but I've saved some goodies for the last day, including a pretty special end to your trip. You could walk between the spots I suggest for today, but many are connected by line 1 on the Metro, so you could jump on and off if your legs get tired! Morning You might have heard of Le Marais, which was once an aristocratic district of Paris and where you'll find many buildings of historic and architectural importance. These days, it's a rather chic neighbourhood, where you might find boutiques, art galleries and cocktail bars. I'm going to suggest a few spots to look out for, including one museum to visit, starting on the east side of the area and heading west. Place des Vosges Place Des Vosges is a grand square that was inaugurated in 1612 with a celebration of the engagement of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria. The square itself has fountains, lawns, trees and a statue of Louis XIII on horseback in the middle. It was originally a place for the nobility to walk and socialise - to see and be seen. These days, it's a lovely spot to picnic or playpetanque. Place des Vosges I think what makes it so attractive is the handsome buildings that surround it: all built to the same design, with red brick walls and blue slate rooves. Porticoes run all the way around, creating a cool sheltered walkway, where you'll find some restaurants and cafes, including Carette, which is known for its hot chocolate. Musée Carnavalet Musée Carnavalet is a really great museum for anyone interested in the history of Paris because its extensive collections chart the story of Paris from antiquity to this century. They have ancient relics, sumptuous room sets from the 17th and 18th centuries and detailed documentation of the French Revolution and the various republics & empires. And Carnavalet Museum is free! Musée Carnavalet I think it would be too much to try to see the entire exhibition, though. I have too much else in store for you today! So I suggest you pick a couple of areas you're interested in and spend around an hour here. Rue des Rosiers Rue des Rosiers is a charming narrow street in the heart of the Jewish Quarter and is a great place to get some low-cost but hearty falafel from one of the many vendors. Hôtel de Ville Hôtel de Ville is the City Hall of Paris and has been since 1357 (although the current building was rebuilt in the 19 th century). The architectural style is that classic French Renaissance style, inspired by the Châteaux of the Loire Valley. It has those recognisable steeply sloped rooves, a spire and fancy chimneys. Hôtel de Ville Lunch For lunch, I recommend Le Georges, a smart modern restaurant on the top of the Pompidou Centre, with southward views of Paris. I really enjoyed some icy strawberry and tomato soup, followed by pasta here on one warm September day in Paris. Afternoon The Louvre For your final afternoon in Paris, I suggest the Musée du Louvre, which you can get to by walking or grabbing the Metro from Hôtel de Ville station to Palais-Royal - Musée du Louvre. A museum since 1793, Musée du Louvre is the world's most-visited museum and home to Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. But it has so much more than that: the museum owns more than 600,000 objects over thousands of years of history and it can take hours to explore thoroughly. It's best to reserve tickets in advance, and I've heard the lines are much shorter if you go into the lower level, inside the pyramid. I haven't tested this myself, though - it's been a while since I went into the Louvre, although I visit the impressive grounds on most of my visits to Paris. The main Renaissance buildings, which were once a royal palace, are suitably grand and stately; and the glass pyramid is such an innovative contrast. Passage de Richelieu Jardin Des Tuileries And Beyond After the Louvre, or instead, if you don't fancy exploring it, carry on heading west towards your final stop the Arc De Triomphe, which you want to reach an hour before sunset. Tuileries Gardens If you have time and energy, there are a few places of interest along the way, including: Jardin des Tuileries - an extensive park with walkways, ponds and views of several iconic landmarks in Paris: the Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, the obelisk at Place de la Concord and, in the distance, the Eiffel Tower. Musée De l'Orangerie is a small art gallery primarily home to several of Monet's largest Water Lilies paintings. You can find it at the western end of Tuileries Gardens. Place de Concorde - it has fancy street lamps and an Egyptian obelisk in the centre. But it's still very busy with cars and hard to admire if I'm being honest... Petit Palais is a lovely gallery - and another free one! You won't have time to explore it thoroughly, but I feel like the romantic Beaux-Arts-style architecture is even more impressive than the art. Check out the pretty interior courtyard. Champs-Élysées - known for being the main shopping street in Paris, you might want to have a look at it before or after the Arc De Triomphe. It's not among the best places in Paris, though, in my opinion, but the view to the Arc De Triomphe is pretty cool. Petit Palais If you prefer, or if you're running out of time, you could get the Metro instead of walking this stretch - line 1 goes from the Louvre to Charles de Gaulle-Etoile station in a few stops. Arc De Triomphe The reason I say you should get here an hour before sunset is your final stop is wonderful at sunset. The final stop is the viewing platform on top of the Arc De Triomphe, that impressive monument installed by Napoleon to honour those who died for France in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Arc De Triomphe It's a great thing to do in Paris at any time, but it's extra special to see the sun go down over Paris, to watch the skies change and then to see the city lights come on. And of course, the best part is when the Eiffel Tower sparkles, which it does for 5 minutes every hour. Sunset skies Eiffel Tower sparkles Sunset views from the Arc De Triomphe roof terrace What a great way to end this itinerary for 4 days in Paris! Dinner But we're not finished: you still need to eat! The only restaurant I have been to near the Arc De Triomphe is a very fancy, very expensive fine dining restaurant in the Hotel Peninsula: L'Oiseau Blanc. If you don't mind splashing some serious cash (I'm not exaggerating, the prices made my jaw drop), this is a great way to spend your final evening in Paris. The meal I had here was exquisite. Canapes at L'Oiseau Blanc If your budget doesn't stretch that far, don't worry: there are plenty of more affordable places to eat in the lively Bastille area (which means jumping back on the Metro first). these include Café des Anges and Le Pure Café, which featured in the movie Before Sunset.

Is 4 Days Enough To See Paris? / How Many Days In Paris Is Enough? Look, I'm someone who loves Paris and keeps coming back several times a year - so for me, there is no number of days that is truly 'enough'. It's a big city with a rich history. Sometimes I re-do the same things; sometimes I discover new things. I feel like I'll always be able to find delight in Paris, no matter how much time I've spent there. That said, I don't believe that there's a minimum number of days, either. I have done several short trips when I spent only 1 or 2 days in Paris. My philosophy is if you only have x days in Paris, better to have that number of days than no days in Paris. I created this itinerary for 4 days In Paris because 4 days is a good amount of time to experience the best of Paris. You can get a feel for the breadth of what the city has to offer. And it's not too much time that you'll tire of Paris if it isn't to your liking (this happens - some people think Paris is overrated and Paris Syndrome is a real thing!). And ultimately, if you like what you see in those 4 days in Paris, you can always come back for more, like I do. I love exploring off-the-beaten-path Paris What Is The Best Time To Visit Paris? I've been to Paris in every season and my favourites are Spring and Autumn (Fall). In both of these 'shoulder' seasons, you do have the risk of rain, but I think the benefits outweigh the downsides. Spring in Paris is glorious, especially in April and early May, when the city blooms: first flowers and cherry blossoms, then the trees burst into life with vibrant green leaves. This is the best season for exploring Paris's many outdoor attractions and gorgeous parks. Autumn in Paris is excellent too: in September and October, the weather can still be mild, making the city very walkable. And the leaves change to orange and red, so you see the city in a softer light. Paris in winter is the quietest in terms of visitor numbers, and it can get pretty cold (definitely coats, scarves and gloves weather) - but I like this season too. In December, the Christmas festivities are really nice: there are pretty light displays and lots of cheerful Parisian Christmas Markets. And January, whilst being dark and cold, is your best chance for exploring without the crowds - though you might find opening hours can be reduced. Paris in Spring Paris in Autumn Paris in Winter Summer in Paris is my least favourite season, and I've avoided it for years. It can be too hot to explore the city on foot. And in August, some businesses close as many Parisians take their holidays elsewhere. Getting To Paris If you're travelling a long distance to Paris, you'll probably fly in. Check Skyscanner for flight deals - that's normally my go-to. There are several airports around Paris, but Charles de Gaulle Airport is the main international one. From the airport, you can get into Paris by taxi (~45-60 minutes), train (RER B trains take about 35 mins to Chatelet) or Roissybus (which takes 45-60 minutes, depending on traffic). If you're travelling to Paris from a closer location, you might choose to take the train, seeing as Paris has high-speed connections to the UK, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Spain. If you're arriving by train, the main international train stations ( Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est and Gare de Lyon) are all fairly central and connected to the Metro system. How Much Money Do You Need For 4 Days In Paris? It's easy to spend a lot in Paris! There's a lot to do, and it's a popular place, so many attractions know they can price their tickets high and people will still pay it. In general, I think the following is a useful guideline for what to budget for 4 days in Paris: Budget hotels: €75-200 per night Mid-range hotels €00-300 per night Luxury Hotels €400+ per night Lunch in a casual restaurant: €15-20 Dinner in a bistro: €5-50 Museums/landmarks: €10-30 In this Paris itinerary, I've included a mix of free or low-cost activities and some more pricey options - but you'll be able to flex according to your own budget. Where To Stay In Paris? I've found that it's best to book hotels in Paris in advance in order to give yourself the best possible choice and to avoid high charges. Here are a few hotel options for your 4-day trip to Paris. I've stayed in all of these places myself in the last couple of years, and I recommend them (I've left out the places I stayed that I don't recommend!). La Finca Hôtel & Spa (previously the Hotel Auberge Flora) is in thevibrant Bastille area. It's a good 3-star option. The rooms are snug but comfortable and well-equipped. I liked the cheerful bar downstairs and they offer a simple breakfast in the morning. I didn't try the spa, though - I think they have added that since I stayed there. Incharming Montmartre, the Terrass\" Hotel is an excellent 4-star hotel, which is close to the many attractions of Montmartre and also has wonderful views across Paris to the Eiffel Tower - from both its rooftop bar & restaurant and some rooms/suites. Breakfast at the Terrass\" Hotel Hôtel Diva Opéra is a centrally-located 4-star boutique hotel in Fauberg-Montmartre. It's close to Boulevard Haussmann and the fancy department stores, like Galeries Lafayette, plus there are plenty of cafes in the vicinity, as well as several of the best covered passages in Paris. If you want to indulge a little on this trip to Paris, I can also recommend the 5-star Hotel Regina Louvre, which is right next to the Louvre. The hotel is smart, luxurious and has great food. Some rooms have a view of the Eiffel Tower. Hotel Regina Louvre For more Paris hotel recommendations, read my post on the best place to stay in Paris for first-timers. Getting Around Paris I think Paris is very walkable, but it's hard to see the best of Paris in 4 days without using the Metro at least a few times. But don't worry, it's pretty easy to use (and much cheaper than taking taxis everywhere). I use CityMapper to help me plan my routes across Paris - this clever, free app has all the public transport data in it and it will show you the best routes around the city, including walking, buses, trams, trains and the Metro. I prefer it to Googlemaps for getting around via public transport. Paris Metro Tips When you use the Metro, remember to make a note of which line you need. And also note the final destination for that line - this will help you make sure you take the train that is going in the right direction because they don't use 'westbound' or 'uptown' or anything like that. Also, make sure you keep your ticket until you leave the metro. Even though you don't need the ticket to exit the station, if you were stopped during a random ticket check and couldn't produce the ticket you used to enter the metro, you would be charged a fine - and you don't want that!

It's a beautiful, well-adored, historically magnificent city. Out of all my travel destinations, I have to admit, Paris is probably one of my favorites. It just feels like an entirely different world. There are so many attractions to visit, so many monuments to awe over, such beautiful architecture, and so much fashion to delve into, you will never find yourself bored there. In the last three years I've been to Paris three times, because no matter how many times I go, I never tire of it. Beyond the iconic Eiffel Tower, Paris has been renowned since the 17th century for diplomacy, fashion, arts and sciences, and notably, its extensive street lighting system earning it the nickname \"City of Lights.\" Pretty cool, huh? With all the things to do in the city it can get overwhelming, especially if you're considering visiting the city for the first time. And while a weekend trip lets you experience the highlights, I recommend a week-long stay - you deserve it! I have the perfect 7-day Paris itinerary for you plus tips and trips on navigating the city and its museums. Whenever if travel, I like to plan various activities in the same general area so that time isn't lost going back and forth in a train or taxi. Paris is broken up into different districts called arrondissements, and this weeklong Paris itinerary focuses on different days in a handful of my favorite ones. Paris Itinerary: Exploring The City in 7 Days Day 1 It's day 1 in Paris and I know you want to see it all. But, don't start worrying just yet. If you follow this itinerary, you'll be booked all week. No need to cram everything in on the first day! That being said, after landing at Charles de Gaulle airport, getting through customs, taking the RER B train or taxi to the city, and checking into your destination, you'll likely find yourself exhausted. I always like to plan a lowkey, relaxing activity. If you're staying at a hotel in Paris, they often offer to store your luggage for you even if your room isn't ready, so you can go ahead and start exploring! Take a Seine River Cruise Other than dinner at a close by café, one of the most relaxing activities that I can think of for your first day in Paris is a cruise on the Seine River. Assuming jet lag isn't getting the best of you, this is a beautiful way to start your Paris trip since you'll begin your trip by seeing Paris's most famous monuments. Enjoy views of the Eiffel Tower, pass by museums like the Louvre and Musée d'Orsay, then get a glimpse of Il de Cite with Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle. Paris has 37 bridges, several of which you'll get to see up close, that you can only view via boat. There are a variety of options for a boat cruise on the Seine River, from a basic hour tour to more elevated options with snacks, champagne, and even dinner. I recommend Vedettes de Paris if you're staying near the Arc de Triomphe, Trocadero area or Eiffel Tower and Vedettes du Pont Neuf if you're staying in Saint Germain, the Latin Quarter, near the Louvre, or in Le Marais. Both offer one-hour guided tours in French and English. No matter which boat company you choose, all bateaux mouches follow the same path, offering the same sightseeing experience. I like to take a boat cruise in the evening before or after dinner, but this will of course depend on your arrival time in Paris. Spend the rest of your first day walking around winding local streets near your hotel or apartment; they're part of what makes Paris so charming, and it's the best way to get acquainted with your neighborhood. Day 2 - 1 st Arrondissement It's your first morning in Paris, and you're probably still trying to pinch yourself awake from the dreamthat is this city. Whenever I travel somewhere new, I like to cross of the heavy hitters and must-see things at the start of my trip. In Paris, this means classic landmarks and iconic museums. Grab a pair of comfortable sneakers (everyone in Paris was wearing these or these when I visited last) and get ready for a sightseeing day! Tour the Louvre Whether you're an art lover or not, the Louvre is one the most iconic museums to exist. It's the world's largest museum and houses some of the most famous masterpieces ever created. Here, you'll find the Mona Lisa, The Winged Victory of Samothrace, and Venus de Milo. You won't grasp how extraordinary this experience is until you try it yourself, and it's extremely overwhelming, even if you've visited before. Although you can use a map or purchase an interactive one with self-guided tours, I found the device to be unreliable with spotty geo-locating, which is needed for it to be effective. Planning a Trip to Paris? Get my curated guide to the City of Lights, with over 50 pages and 100+ recommendations, plus travel tips, basic etiquette, an interactive map, and more! buy the guide Instead, I'd highly recommend one of several guided tours through the museum. You can book these directly through the Louvre website or here. A guided walking tour through the Louvre is a great way to see the museum's most famous works with informative commentary in 2 hours. Plus, you can always stay later if there are any part of the museum you still want to discover. I personally love the Napoleon III Apartments wing! After your visit, you'll definitely need a snack or lunch. There are several food kiosks in Jardin des Tuileries (Tuileries Garden) just across the street. Then, make your way to Musee de L'Orangerie to continue your museum day. See Claude Monet's Water Lilies Located on the far west side of the Jardin des Tuileries (Tuileries Garden) is Musee de L'Orangerie. It's a serene, all white interior museum that houses Claude Monet's enormous water lilies paintings. Stop By Place de la Concorde Just a short walk from this museum is Place de la Concorde, a site full of significant history. In its early days, it was an execution spot during the French Revolution, tallying up to 1,119 people guillotined just in this square alone, including Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. That quickly changed, when less than 100 years later, Jacques-Ignace Hittorf changed the square into what exists today. Now sits the Luxor Obelisk, an Egyptian monument placed in 1836, reputable hotels, and two monumental fountains. You don't need to spend a ton of time here, but you can see the Obelisk up close and stare straight down Avenue de Champs Elysees for a view of the Arc de Triomphe. Day 3 - Take a Day Trip Visit Versailles For your third day, get away from Paris' city center and take a fun day trip! Day trips are the best way to still enjoy what the city has to offer while giving yourself a break from trying to take it all in. Versailles is a wonderful day trip if it's your first time in Paris. I know some people find it overrated, but the lawns themselves are stunning, and it's a huge part of France's history, dating all the way back to the 1600s. You'll want to get there are early in the morning as possible because it does get very crowded. I went there years ago when I was in high school and I still vividly remember the sprawling lawn enormous gardens, and famous Hall of Mirrors. It's worth paying for a guided tour of the palace and gardens ; learn about the lavish life of kings and queens, a typical day in the life of Marie Antoinette, and explore the green space that was once the setting forelaborate balls and parties. Other day trips from Paris include Disneyland Paris (40 minutes), Reims for Champagne tasting (45 minutes), and if you're an art lover, Giverny to visit Claude Monet's home and garden (60 minutes). Day 4 - 4 th, 5 th and 6 th Arrondissements I stayed a full month in Paris right on the edge of the 5 th and 6 th arrondissements, so I'm biased when I say these neighborhoods on the Left Bank are my favorite. Even though there are plenty of tourists, this area somehow feels a little more local than other touristy parts of the city. See Notre Dame Cathederal Start your day visiting Il de la Cite, a little island that is where the history of Paris begins. The most famous landmark here is of course Notre Dame. Admire its beautiful gothic architecture and rose windows from the outside, and be sure to take a walk through the cathedral now that it's restored after the 2019 fire. Visit Sainte Chapelle and La Conciergerie A couple blocks over you'll find Sainte Chapelle, another church on the island with the most impressive display of impressive of stained-glass windows I've ever seen. It's truly breathtaking. Just next door you'll find La Conciergerie, which at various points in time was a royal palace, courthouse, and prison. Walk Ile Saint Louis From here, you can stroll east on Ile de la Cite to another small island, Ile Saint Louis. You'll notice several cafes all serving local Berthillon ice cream. Sit down and enjoy a scoop, or find even more flavors at the original Berthillon ice cream shop and tea room, also located on the island. Ile Saint Louis is always quiet and peaceful, and it's a great little escape in the middle of Paris. Head to the Latin Quarter After your ice cream, head south and over the river into the Left Bank. You're now entering the Latin Quarter, or 5 th arrondissement. Because the Latin Quarter is one of the oldest parts of the city, you'll feel like you stepped back in time into what Paris was in the very beginning. It began and remained a central hub for learning and education, housing many universities within its borders. Here's a quick run-through of everything you'll get to see while walking through: Saint-Michel Fountain Sorbonne University Shakespeare & Co The Pantheon You can easily walk to any or all of these. After you're done, stop by a boulangerie to pick up a sandwich, and head to Jardin du Luxembourg. Enjoy Jardin du Luxembourg Known for its lush lawns, tree-lined paths, and of course the famous green lawn chairs, it's easy to see why so many people love Jardin du Luxembourg. Take a seat in a chair, eat your sandwich, and enjoy people watching while you rest your feet for a bit. In warmer months you'll find dozens of children running around the large fountain, chasing around their sailboats in the water. You'll also find the beautiful Medici Fountain here, which looks like it was plucked right out for a fairytale. End Your Day in Saint Germain Saint-Germain-des-Prés (the 6 th arrondissement), seated right on the left bank, was originally known for the artists, writers, and painters. Now, it's become known for its bustling and lively vibe full of cafes, galleries, markets, and true heritage. There are plenty of places to visit and this place is truly a little village of its own. Be sure to stop by one of the cafes; they are plentiful here. Don't miss Café de Flore or Les Deux Magots; both are Instagram-worthy, but the people are nicer at Les Deux Magot (as is the food). Once you're done exploring, end your night with rooftop drinks with panoramic views of Paris at Hôtel Dame des Arts at 4 Rue Danton. Be sure to make advance reservations here. Day 5 - Montmartre & Other Arrondissements Montmartre and Sacre Coeur The neighborhood of Montmartre feels very different from the rest of Paris. With steep winding roads and a bohemian feel, it's almost as if you're not even in the same city. But it's definitely worth a trip here. Perched at the top of the hill you'll find Sacre Coeur Basilica. Even if you're not religious you should go in; it's really pretty (and you're already there so you may as well). The steps of this church provide a bird's eye view of Paris and it's beautiful. After, take a short walk down a winding road to Place du Tertre, the famous square where you can find dozens of painters and portrait artists, cafes, and small tourist shops. Take some time to get lost in the little side streets, then make your way over to Terrass Hotel for a fabulous rooftop lunch or drinks. Moulin Rouge is about a five-minute walk from here, but keep in mind that its immediate surrounding areas are vastly different from where you're coming from since it's located in the former red-light district. If you really want to see it, great, but there's not much to it and I don't love the area. Grab a taxi and make your way to the Arc de Triomphe. Take in Rooftop Views at Arc de Triomphe Arc de Triomphe is one of my favorite Paris landmarks. Climb up 330 stairs to the top (there's an elevator for those who need it) for views of the Eiffel Tower as well as the buildings and streets. Although the view is especially incredible at nighttime, it's breathtaking no matter the time you take the trek. You can then take the metro to Trocadero, a massive open area with another A+ view of the Eiffel Tower. It's always busy, but once you're there you can see why. Alternatively, make dinner reservations for Girafe. It's an upscale restaurant with the same view and great food. If you time things correctly and have dinner late enough at night, you'll also be able to see the Eiffel Tower light up and sparkle. It sparkles at the top of every hour after dusk hits.

I'd be remiss to skip out on mentioning shopping in Paris! Shopping in Paris is always a good idea. For starters, most French brands are cheaper there than in the US because there's no exporting. This means decent savings on French fashion brands like Sezane, French pharmacy beauty, and especially designer purchases - even when converting from euros to dollars. But you can also take advantage of VAT refunds. VAT (value added tax) is included in all prices in the European Union, and you're able to qualify to get that refunded so long as your purchase is over 100 euros and you let the sales associate know before you purchase, so they can provide you with the right forms. (When you leave Paris, scan these are the passport and within a few weeks you'll receive the VAT amount back onto your card.) This is usually around 12%. Rue Saint-Honoré and the surrounding streets are famous for luxury shopping, and you can find everything there from Dior and Louis Vuitton to Hermes and Chanel. There are also several amazing department stores in Paris: Le Bon Marche, Samaritaine, and BHV. Walk Around Le Marais You can also find small boutiques and vintage stores in Le Marais, so head there in the afternoon after you've dropped off any designer purchases safely at your hotel. Once you're in the area, be sure to visit La Place des Vosges. It's the oldest square in Paris. It's small, but it's pretty. Find a nice brasserie or café for dinner. Where To Stay In Paris Paris is a large city, and each arrondisssement, or district, has a different vibe. There's truly a place for everyone here but is also makes choosing an area overwhelming. The 6th Arrondissement This is where I have stayed the most during my trips to Paris, so it's where I have the most recommendations. The 6 th arrondissement, otherwise known as Saint Germain, is one of my favorite neighborhoods. It boasts tons of cafes, great shopping, and easy access to both the Seine and Jardin du Luxembourg. I prefer to stay here because it feels a bit more local than areas like Champs Elysees or near the Louvre but is still centrally located. A few fabulous hotels in this area include: Hotel d'Aubusson Hotel Relais Christine Le Relais Saint Germain Hotel Dame des Artes Other Hotels in Paris La Fantaisie (9 th arrondissement) - beautiful courtyard garden, vibrant interiors, and restaurant by Michelin-starred chef Dominique Crenn. The rooftop bar and spa are highly recommended. Grands Boulevards Experime ntal (between 2 nd and 9 th arrondissements) - glass-covered courtyard dining area, and if you're into cocktails, this is the place to be Terrass Hotel (18 th arrondissement/Montmartre) - quiet, village vibes but super close to Sacre Coeur and Moulin Rouge. Great rooftop bar with panoramic views and romantic feels, plus also a Nuxe Spa there in case you want to add in a day of pampering. Luxury Hotels in Paris Plaza Athenee The Ritz Hotel Lutetia Cheval Blanc Are you excited to go to Paris yet? Paris is a beautiful city to visit, and there's so much to do there.

I have been postponing the creation of this blog article for years now. The reason is pretty simple, I'm way too emotionally attached to this city and there is so much I want to say that it is hard to even know where to start. I've lived in the city of lights for about 5 years, but have been visiting since I was born (half of my family is from there). Over the years, I've had multiple friends visiting, and I was always on a mission to show them the best of the city! Unfortunately, Paris isn't exactly known for its welcoming approach and a lot of visitors end up not enjoying their time in this beautiful city. I'm here to help change that, and I'm proud to say that every single person who's visited me during my time there has had an amazing time! In this blog article, I share my 5-day Parisian itinerary for first-timers. Most days are packed with activities and sightseeing, so feel free to mix things around or spread those activities over a longer period if you can afford to do that! It's also worth noting that Paris is a city that needs to be seen on foot - meaning there will be a lot of walking involved. Don't worry, you can also rely on public transport to do the same itinerary, but in my opinion, the most beautiful things to see in Paris are its streets and its buildings. Paris The itinerary that'll make you fall in love with the City of Lights Shop this print Day 1: From Montmartre to the Opera Highlights Montmartre & Sacré-Coeur Pigalle Moulin Rouge Galeries Lafayette Opéra Garnier Start your day early, catching the sunrise in Montmartre before the crowds roll in. Hop off at Anvers station and take your time ascending the steps, passing by a charming carousel. Once Sacré-Coeur opens, make sure to explore this beautiful church, with a special recommendation for the dome climb - my personal favourite. Wander through Montmartre's iconic spots like La Maison Rose, Le Consulat, and Le Moulin de la Galette. Grab a coffee or breakfast at The Hardware Société, a lovely Australian café. Head down to Abbesses via Rue Lepic, stopping to check out the Wall of Love. Take a quick detour to Moulin Rouge; you can always revisit at night to see the neighbourhood lit up. For lunch, consider Bouillon Pigalle for traditional French fare or Pink Mamma for its iconic decor and delicious truffle pasta. After lunch, explore Galeries Lafayette, admiring the dome and enjoying panoramic views from the rooftop. Even if shopping isn't your thing, the architecture and views are worth a visit. If you're visiting during the Christmas period, make sure to check out their famous Lafayette Christmas Tree. End your day at the Opera Garnier, known for its stunning facade and mesmerizing interiors. Plan ahead for a guided tour to learn about its history - the Opera Garnier has witnessed over a century of artistic performances and holds architectural significance as a masterpiece by Charles Garnier. If you're feeling a bit peckish, a coffee break at Café de la Paix is a good idea. Then head back to your hotel, get changed for dinner, and find my dinner recommendations at the end of this article. DISCOVER MY PARIS PRINT COLLECTION Shop here Day 2: Parisian Icons Highlights Eiffel Tower, Trocadéro & Champ-de-Mars Champs Elysées Arc-de-Triomphe Place de la Concorde Alexandre III Bridge Louvre Museum & Louvre Pyramid Today is all about exploring Paris' most famous landmarks. If you're an early bird like me, head to the Eiffel Tower at sunrise. Get off at Trocadéro metro station for a serene experience at Place du Trocadéro before the crowds arrive. Slowly make your way down the stairs towards the Champ-de-Mars to get closer to the Eiffel Tower. There's a really nice photo opportunity here for those of you who like photography. You might get hungry very quickly if you visit early in the morning, and I urge you to follow this piece of advice: do not, I repeat do not head to the first few restaurants you see near Paris' most famous monuments. The food will be average, the service horrible and the prices astronomical. Instead, opt for French toast at Ladurée on Les Champs Élysées; make sure to grab a box of their famous macarons before you leave. Move on to the Arc-de-Triomphe; while most people stop here for a photo, know that there are 11 other less crowded avenues around the Place Charles-de-Gaulle. The tunnel to go underneath Place Charles-de-Gaulle and get to the Arc-de-Triomphe is located here. Once you've crossed to the middle of this place, you'll be able to climb to the top of it! Resist the shopping temptations on Les Champs Élysées (it's full of scammers and pickpockets) and head to Place de la Concorde. Then, head right and cross the Alexandre III Bridge, a beautiful piece of architecture, adorned with exquisite sculptures and offering a splendid view of the Seine River. People love to gather around here during the warm summer months to enjoy a drink! Explore the Tuileries garden and head to the Louvre Pyramid. Grab a coffee or drinks at Café Marly or simply snap some photos from Passage de Richelieu. Art enthusiasts can consider visiting both Le Louvre and Musée d'Orsay, though you might be museum-fatigued by this point. The Louvre, once a royal palace, now houses an extensive collection, including the Mona Lisa. Musée d'Orsay, a former railway station, boasts Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces. No matter which one you choose to visit, make sure to make a booking ahead of time to avoid any disappointments. If you have time, you should definitely check out the Palais Royal near Le Louvre; its intriguing cylinder installations provide a picturesque backdrop for photos. Note for those who love museums: There are other nice museums in the area including Le Musée des Arts Décoratifs, which usually hosts fashion exhibitions, and the Musée de l'Orangerie which focuses on European 20th-century art. Other Parisian museums I really like are: the Musée d'Art Moderne, the Musée Rodin, the Musée Jacquemart-André, the Petit Palais, the Centre George Pompidou and the Musée du Quai Branly.

Keep it low-key and respectful of residents' privacy during your early morning visit. Walk along Canal St-Martin to Place des Vosges, a beautiful square, especially during autumn, with a rich history dating back to the 17th century. In Le Marais, enjoy breakfast at one of Rue Des Archives' charming cafes. Head to L'Hôtel de Ville and then L'Ile de la Cité to see Notre-Dame-de-Paris, even if it's still closed for renovations at the time of your visit. Explore the streets around the cathedral, you'll surely stumble upon Au Vieux Paris d'Arcole, one of Paris' oldest restaurants. Notre-Dame, a masterpiece of French Gothic architecture, witnessed centuries of history, from royal events to Victor Hugo's literary masterpiece \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.\" Don't overlook Sainte-Chapelle; it's worth a visit for its breathtaking interiors, showcasing stunning stained glass windows. Move on to St-Germain-des-Prés and take in the charm of the Latin Quarter. Consider lunch or a coffee at iconic cafes like Cafe de Flore or Cafe des Deux Magots, both frequented by famous writers and intellectuals. Explore Église St-Germain, rue de Buci, and Église St-Sulpice. Rue de Renne offers a less crowded shopping experience, and Le Bon Marché is a tranquil department store nearby. Hôtel Lutetia is also located nearby and displays stunning Parisian architecture. End your day with a leisurely stroll or a picnic at the peaceful Jardin du Luxembourg, a perfect way to wrap up your exploration. The garden, commissioned by Queen Marie de Medici in the 17th century, reflects the elegance of French classical style. DISCOVER MY PARIS PRINT COLLECTION SHOP HERE Day 4: Day Trip to Versailles Highlights Palace of Versailles Grand Trianon Queen's Hamlet Take a day to explore the Palace of Versailles, a one-hour journey from Paris accessible by car or RER C. This UNESCO World Heritage site, commissioned by Louis XIV in the 17th century, reflects the grandeur of France's monarchy across 2,000 acres of stunning grounds. Begin your tour in the Palace's Hall of Mirrors, a dazzling hall adorned with 357 mirrors, symbolising the wealth and power of the French monarchy and where the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919. Admire the opulent Royal Apartments, including the iconic Queen's Bedroom and King's Bedroom, showcasing the extravagant taste of the monarchs. Explore the Petit Trianon, a retreat for Marie Antoinette, and its Queen's Hamlet, offering a glimpse into royal rustic life. The Grand Trianon, another royal retreat, boasts a pink marble facade and elegant gardens. Visit the Orangery, housing citrus trees in winter, and the charming Temple of Love in the Estate of Trianon. Conclude your day with a stroll through the manicured gardens, adorned with fountains and statues. The musical gardens and fountain shows on selected days transport you to the era of Louis XIV. This day trip provides a condensed yet immersive journey into the extravagant lifestyle and rich history of the French monarchy. Important: always check opening hours ahead of time to avoid any surprise when you get there. The Palace is usually closed on Mondays. I'd also strongly recommend booking your tickets ahead of time. When you're back in Paris, go get changed at your hotel and head out to dinner. Once you're done with dinner, make sure to go back to the Eiffel Tower to admire its beautiful lights at nighttime. DISCOVER MY PARIS PRINT COLLECTION SHOP HERE Day 5: The West Highlights Bois de Boulogne Jardin de Bagatelle Fondation Louis Vuitton Bateaux-Mouches Moulin Rouge at Night On your fifth day in Paris, delve into the western part of the city for a diverse experience that combines nature, art, and the enchanting Seine River. Begin your day at the Bois de Boulogne, a vast public park that once served as a hunting ground for French kings. Today, it offers a serene escape with lakes, gardens, and walking trails. The Parc de Bagatelle within Bois de Boulogne is particularly noteworthy for its charming rose garden and the Bagatelle Château. Move on to the Fondation Louis Vuitton, an architectural masterpiece designed by Frank Gehry. This contemporary art museum hosts rotating exhibitions, showcasing works from various artists. The building itself is a work of art, characterized by its futuristic design and innovative use of glass. For a peaceful lunch in nature, head to the Auberge du Bonheur. If you're more of a city person, then head to Brasserie d'Auteuil instead. In the afternoon, slowly make your way back into the city. Bir Hakeim Bridge is a really great spot for a photo op and some more amazing views of the Eiffel Tower. Then, take a leisurely cruise along the Seine River with the Bateaux-Mouches. These boat tours provide a unique perspective of Paris, allowing you to glide past iconic landmarks while enjoying informative commentary. Witness the city's beauty from a different angle as you relax on the boat. As night falls, revisit the vibrant neighbourhood of Pigalle to experience the Moulin Rouge in all its illuminated glory. If you're lucky enough to secure tickets for the show, I've heard it's a really good one! Otherwise, head to dinner in one of the many good restaurants in the area.

G. deep house, tech house & techno). Frequently asked questions (fAQs) Here are some of the questions that most of my friends have asked me in the past. I thought I'd summarise them here to help clarify how Paris is like. Where to stay in Paris? This depends on the type of vibe you're looking for. Some of my favourite neighbourhoods I would recommend staying in are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 9th & 18th arrondissements. I'd suggest pinning all the locations you want to visit on a map and choosing a nice hotel or Airbnb that's closest to all the main attractions you want to visit. Avoid staying in all of the northern areas and the outskirts of the city. These areas can be dodgy, especially at night. I'd also recommend staying away from Les Champs Elysées at night. How to get around Paris? By foot, metro and Uber. If you're brave enough (I'm not), you might also want to try the electric scooters. The Parisian metro, despite being very old and smelly at times, is super convenient and takes you to places in no time. I'd suggest buying tickets by groups of 10 - if this option is still available at the ticket machines. Visit the RAPT website for the latest fares and routes. Important: take care of your belongings when using public transportation. Do not hold your phones near the doors, and make sure your pockets are empty and bags are closed. There are pickpockets everywhere. Is Paris a safe city to visit? The answer to this question depends. I find Paris relatively safe, but it is worth noting that there are a lot of scammers and pickpockets. It's also not particularly fun as a solo woman traveller because there is still a lot of catcalling happening; don't walk alone at night in creepy alleys. Try to be street-smart and not attract attention too much. Avoid wearing expensive things and don't believe random strangers who might come and talk to you on the street; chances are another person is robbing you from the back. Are there days when things are closed in Paris? Yes! I have found this to be one of the most frustrating things in France. Always check the opening hours of the places you want to visit, especially landmarks, castles, churches and museums. This also applies to restaurants. A lot of places are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays so it's worth doing your research beforehand. What typical French food should I try whilst in Paris? When in Paris, you'll have multiple options of French food to choose from. Some classics include beef tartare, steak frites, charcuterie & cheese boards, onion soup, duck confit, croque-monsieur/madame, cassoulet, boeuf bourguignon and foie gras. If you're into trying less common dishes, you might wanna try escargots (snails), cuisses de grenouille (frog legs) or andouillette (pork's intestines sausage).

Could I conquer Paris in a weekend? \"Absolutely,\" I thought. And that's exactly what I tried to do. My roommate and I didn't have classes on Fridays, so she and I decided to book our flight for an upcoming Thursday night. That would give us all of Friday and Saturday to explore Paris before flying back to Granada, Spain, on Sunday. Two days would be plenty of time, we assured ourselves as we scrambled to book hostel accommodations and research our destination to find things to do in Paris that weekend. With a $250 budget and a hilariously poor command of the French language, I was certain I had everything I needed to see the best of Paris in just 48 hours. Paris Itinerary: Day 1 After a few flight delays, my roommate and I arrived in Paris late on Thursday night. Although we were excited to be there, our exhaustion got the best of us. Within our first few minutes in The City of Lights, we were already struggling to navigate the Paris Metro. After a close call with a pickpocket and a few desperate searches for English-speakers, we made it to our hostel just minutes before the 1 a.m. curfew. I'm lucky my roommate set her alarm for 6:30 the next morning, or we would have slept through our entire first day in Paris. 7 a.m. -- Café breakfast Although breakfast was provided at our hostel, my roommate and I wanted to take advantage of our proximity to the historic Montmartre neighborhood. We followed our noses to a nearby café, where we ordered a croissant and a pan au lait each, with a bowl of fresh fruit and two coffees on the side. 8 a.m. -- Sacré-Coeur Basilica Since we were already in Montmartre, we decided to pay a quick visit to the gorgeous Sacré-Coeur Basilica. We took in the views from the top of the stairs and spent a blissful hour enjoying the tranquility of Paris in February. Fast Fact: The basilica's dome is open every day. There is no elevator, so you'll need to climb the 280 steps up a narrow staircase to get to the top. 10 a.m. -- Walking tour Following another confusing mishap in the Paris Metro, we managed to find our way to the fountain at Place Saint-Michel. Here, we caught a free walking tour of the city. I'm a huge fan of SANDEMANs free walking tours. Not only are they informative, but they tend to attract a diverse group of students, families, and other thrifty travelers. The tour was essentially a two-and-a-half-hour crash course in Parisian history, culture, and architecture, and I came away from it with a newfound appreciation for one of the world's favorite cities. Fast Fact: At Place Saint-Michel, you're close to the world-famous university, la Sorbonne. With all those students nearby, you'll find ample used bookstores and affordable bistros and cafés. 1 p.m. -- The Eiffel Tower After a quick pit stop for sandwiches, we managed to find our way to Paris's crown jewel: the Eiffel Tower. Neither my roommate nor I had the budget or the time to go to the top of the tower, but we enjoyed taking touristy pictures in the nearby park. Fast Fact: The price of Eiffel Tower tickets ranges from about 12€ to 30€ for adults depending on which level you want to go to and whether you choose to take the elevator or stairs. There are discounted rates for children, youth (for ticketing purposes, you're \"young\" until age 24), and travelers with disabilities. 2:30 p.m. -- The Louvre Although I love art, the Louvre was, tragically, too pricey and too time-consuming for our weekend in Paris. That said, my roommate and I were able to admire the glass pyramids outside the visitor center while we indulged in some fresh chocolate-banana crepes. Fast Fact: If you have some extra time and the weather is nice, include the Tuileries Garden and Carrousel Garden in your tour. Both are part of the Louvre Estate. As a bonus, the Tuileries Garden is free to visit. 4 p.m. -- Paris Catacombs The Paris Catacombs weren't as iconic as other landmarks in the city, but they were one of our more interesting stops. The Catacombs took us beneath the city, where we walked among the bones of nearly six million Parisians. While it may sound gruesome, the Catacombs were a necessary measure in the 1700s, when city cemeteries were at capacity. Today, the bones are arranged to create a spectacular mausoleum that honors centuries of Parisians who were laid to rest. Fast Fact: Seven Corners picked the maze-like Paris Catacombs as one of the spookiest destinations in the world. It's well worth the one-hour tour, even when you're only in Paris for a short time. 6 p.m. -- A fancy French dinner Whenever I travel, I try to sample as much of the local cuisine as I can, and my trip to Paris was no exception. After an exhausting day, my roommate and I enjoyed a relaxing dinner at La Vache et Le Cuisinier. Was a fancy French bistro a bit outside of our price range? Perhaps. Was it worth every penny? Absolutely. 8:30 p.m. -- Seine River cruise To end our night in style, we took an hour-long cruise down the Seine River. Unlike our earlier walking tour, we were able to sit back and take in the beauty of the city, all while enjoying a glass of wine. From the water, the bustling city seemed deceptively calm. And when the Eiffel Tower's lights began to shimmer to mark the top of the hour, my roommate and I agreed that the tour was the perfect end to a busy day. Fast Fact: Paris undertook the major project of cleaning up the Seine ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, preparing for its use in the opening ceremonies and swimming events. Paris Itinerary: Day 2 The next day began with another early morning. We were on our way to Versailles! After nearly boarding the wrong train and fumbling our way through the directions from a well-meaning security guard, we found an older British couple who was able to point us in the right direction. Just because we were young, independent travelers didn't mean we were too proud to ask for help. 8:30 a.m. -- The Palace of Versailles Although it involved a 45-minute train ride away from the city, our trip to the Palace of Versailles was time well-spent. My roommate and I spent hours wandering the halls, totally mesmerized by the gorgeous architecture and extravagant art that surrounded us. What's more, the chilly February weather meant that the lines were short and crowds were thin. Fast Fact: Because of the short days and increased chance of rain, February is considered travel's off season in Paris. That makes visits to iconic sites like Versailles less crowded, perfect for a quick visit if you can tolerate the weather. 12:30 p.m. -- Fancy French lunch Before leaving Versailles, we treated ourselves to a hearty lunch in town. In addition to my soup, I may have ordered an entire baked brie appetizer for myself -- because, you know, we were in France. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the cheese may have been the best decision I made during the entire trip. Fast Fact: When you're traveling in France on a budget, take advantage of the specials and smaller portions you'll find during lunchtime at nicer restaurant. It'll be cheaper than the dinner service. 2:30 p.m. -- Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris Once we made our way back to the city, we stopped by the Notre Dame Cathedral. I was a huge fan of Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame as a kid, so visiting the cathedral in person was nothing short of awe-inspiring. I especially appreciated seeing different groups of nuns, priests, and parishioners marveling alongside me. Fast Fact: The cathedral closed after a devastating fire in 2019. It's expected to reopen in December 2024, followed by six months of celebrations. 3:30 p.m. -- Champs-Élysées and Arc De Triomph Although our energy was flagging, we decided to spend the rest of the afternoon window-shopping along the Champs-Élysées. The famous avenue houses enormous retailers familiar at home, like H&M, Sephora, and Gap, along with luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Lacoste. Once we made our way to the end of the street, we took pictures beneath the Arc de Triomphe, an iconic landmark originally commissioned by Emperor Napoleon himself. Fast Fact: The Champs-Élysées is the site of a countless events throughout the year, from film festivals to the finish line of the Tour de France's final stage to the Bastille Day parade. This makes the already-crowded avenue even busier, but also certainly an unforgettable experience. 6:30 p.m. -- Indian food Although our decision to get Indian food was mostly a matter of convenience, it was an absolute hit! Having spent all weekend indulging in rich French cuisine, my roommate and I agreed that it was refreshing to have a spice- and vegetable-heavy meal. Fast Fact: Although India was not a French colony, several other countries were. That's why you'll find a strong culinary influence from places like Vietnam, Senegal, and Lebanon in Paris today. 8 p.m. -- Macaron tasting While macaron tasting wasn't an official item on our itinerary, we did stumble across a gourmet macaron shop later in the evening. It was amazing. Fast Fact: Macarons and macaroons are different types of cookies. In Paris, you're mostly likely to find macarons -- with a single O -- which is a sandwich-style cookie. They come in a variety of flavors and can be filled with jam, buttercream icing, or ganache. Macaroons -- with two O's -- are coconut drop cookies commonly served around the world during Passover. 8:30 p.m. -- Taking a breather After a weekend of rushing to complete our checklist, we were grateful for the downtime we built into our itinerary for Saturday night. We were too exhausted to fully take advantage of Paris nightlife, but we did enjoy strolling back past the Eiffel Tower and through the sparkling streets. We admired glamorous locals as they walked by, stopped to look at a padlock-covered bridge, and spent nearly an hour enjoying a group of street musicians as they played. Can You See Paris in a Weekend? On Sunday morning, my roommate and I boarded our plane back to Spain. The truth was, we had only gotten a small taste of what Paris had to offer. Racing from one destination to the next had left little time for us to appreciate Paris's beauty and culture. Despite the exhaustion that came with the trip, however, I'm glad we went on our impulsive weekend adventure. Having experienced Paris as an overly ambitious college student, I can't wait to return when I have more free time, a larger budget, and a passable knowledge of French. My only hope is that I won't have to wait too long before I'm back again."}]}

If you're already overwhelmed, don't be - because I'm going to give you the best recommendations in my 3 days in Paris itinerary. If it's your first time in Paris, you know you need to see the typical tourist things, like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. But in my opinion, the best part of spending 3 days in Paris is getting to know the culture, the food, and exploring the intricate \"hidden gems\" that make the city special. Taking a trip somewhere - especially to another country - and especially when you've never been to that country - requires a lot of planning, research, and time...which is why I'm sharing my entire itinerary with you here!

The Eiffel Tower and the Seine River But First - My Top Itinerary Tip for Sightseeing Around Paris If you want to experience the best of Paris in the easiest way possible, getting The Paris Pass is the best way to do it! Purchase the Paris Pass from the Go City The Paris Pass is a great way to save money and will allow you to book attractions, tours, and more. You will see me refer to things I did using the Paris Pass multiple times throughout this post. You can choose the number of days that you want your pass for, but it must be used in consecutive days. The more things you do from the Paris Pass, the more money you will save. For a more detailed Paris Pass description, check out my post about Why You Need The Paris Pass Museum Lovers: Get the Paris Museum Pass If you intend on seeing any of the museums through the Paris Pass, you MUST ALSO pick up a Paris Museum Pass. This is NOT something you can download from the Paris Pass or Go City. 3 Days in Paris: The Itinerary Day 1: Travel Day - Welcome to Paris, Wine Tasting, and the Eiffel Tower When I got to Paris, my flight landed at roughly 7:15am (most flights to Europe are overnight flights). If you can sleep on an airplane sitting up, the Lord has blessed you. I am not one of those people. After getting breakfast (a croissant and coffee, obviously), we took a much-needed nap and used the rest of the day to mostly explore. My first breakfast in Paris: pain au chocolat & café au lait We spent our first day familiarizing ourselves with the streets of Paris the best way I know how - by getting \"lost!\" When I have free time on my travel day, I love to leave my hotel, pick a direction, and just start walking. You'll be amazed at how much you discover when you have no idea what's there... In fact, we even stumbled upon the Louvre this way! Wine tasting at Les Caves du Louvre Booked through the Paris Pass ; reservation required. During the tasting, they let us taste 3 different kinds of wine (1 white, 2 red) while the sommelier educated us on the different wines in the regions of France. At the end, you can buy wine and champagne from their shop next door. Inside the wine shop The front of Les Caves du Louvre Who doesn't love a decorative wine display? The Eiffel Tower We ended our first day by (what else?) seeing the Eiffel Tower ! I will never forget seeing it for the first time... I really felt as though it had the \"wow\" factor that I always imagined it would. You can see the Eiffel Tower up close - many people come sit on the grass in front of it for picnics, or even just to hang out. You can also go inside the Eiffel Tower via the Paris Pass, but in my opinion, seeing it from the outside is better! The Eiffel Tower lights up at dusk and stays lit until 1:00 AM (of note, it stays light outside MUCH longer in Paris, so dusk usually isn't until after 9pm!). Every hour on the hour is a glittering light show that lasts for 5 minutes and is 100% worth seeing. Pro Tip: The Eiffel Tower's lighting and sparkling lights are protected by copyright, so professional use of images of the Eiffel Tower at night require prior authorization and may be subject to a fee. Seeing the Eiffel Tower for the first time! You can sit on the grass right in front of the Eiffel Tower to get an up-close-and-personal view. If you want to see the Eiffel Tower from a distance, the best place is Plaza del Trocadéro. The view from Plaza del Trocadéro At the end of the plaza, there are steps you can go down to get an even better view (although, it will still be from a distance). If you go all the way to the bottom, you will be able to walk along the Seine River. The Eiffel Tower & the Seine River Day 2: Full Day - The Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral, Saint Chapelle, Arc de Triomphe, and Champs-Élysées I'm going to be honest with you: I am not a museum person. The Louvre will likely be the only museum I write about, not only on this post but on this entire website. They just aren't my thing. However, if you are a museum person, Paris has a multitude of amazing ones to choose from (and some are included in the Paris Pass)! The Louvre from the outside The Louvre Booked through the Paris Pass ; reservation required. Go early in the morning; you could easily spend hours here if you wanted. The Louvre is CLOSED on Tuesdays. You MUST also get a Paris Museum Pass, which can be obtained from Big Bus Information Center. The Paris Museum Pass website is also great to browse if you want to see more museums than just the Louvre. When Mona Lisa photobombs... The highlight of the Louvre is, of course, The Mona Lisa The most famous painting in the Louvre (and quite possibly the world); painted by Leonardo da Vinci There are signs in the museum that help guide you to where this painting is, and there will be a line of people waiting to get a close-up photo. Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle The Notre Dame Cathedral is about a 20 minute walk from the Louvre As of July 2022, you are still not able to go inside due to damage from the 2019 fire, but it is still magnificent to look at from the outside. The Notre Dame Cathedral has an anticipated reopening date of 2024. A short walk away from the cathedral is Sainte Chapelle, a gothic-style cathedral originally built to house relics of Christ. Although not as famous as Notre Dame, you CAN tour this one! Paris Pass - reservation required Known for it's high ceilings and (equally high) gorgeous, stained-glass windows. Champs-Élysées Paris's most iconic shopping street. This street has some affordable shops, but it was also very ritzy. You will find everything from Zara to Chanel. A nearby landmark is the Pont Alexandre III bridge.You can walk across the bridge and admire its stunning, extravagant architecture, along with great views of the Seine River! Some of Paris's iconic shopping At the opposite end of Champs-Élysées from the bridge stands the Arc de Triomphe, a massive structure built to honor those who died in the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars. You can make a reservation through the Paris Pass to go up to the top of the tower and get a great view of the city! The Arc de Triomphe at night Day 3: Full Day - Palace of Versailles, Le Marais, Montmartre The Palace of Versailles The Palace of Versailles The Palace of Versailles is a must-see day trip if you have enough time! Booked through The Paris Pass You MUST also get a Paris Museum Pass to be allowed to enter the Palace. The Palace of Versailles is CLOSED on Mondays. There is a link on the Go City app with the Paris Pass to book your reservation time. The Palace of Versallies is an absolutely magnificent building adorned in bright gold, and the interior has a variety of different chambers and suites that are replicas of the royal era. Originally built by King Louis XIII to be used as a hunting lodge, and then later turned into a chateau. The chateau was eventually expanded by King Louis XIV into a palace. Today it is declared a UNESCO World Heritage site and is one of the top tourist attractions in the world. We chose to only tour the palace since we had other things planned for today, but you could easily spend an entire day here if you wanted to. A glimpse inside the Palace of Versailles There are ticket options that allow you to tour the Gardens, which are absolutely massive, and which also include the Estate of Trianon (Marie Antoinette's estate). To give you an idea of just how massive: Walking from the Palace of Versailles to the Grand Canal of the gardens would take you 15 minutes (there are other sections of the gardens, such as Apollo's Bath Grove, that are much closer). Walking to the Estate of Trianon would take you 25 minutes. When touring the inside of the palace, it is important to enter on the right wing side as opposed to the left. We entered on the wrong side and ended up accidentally going out the exit way before we were ready! (Thankfully, they let us back in, but we had to go through security again!) Entering on the right will take you through the Gallery of the History of the Palace, and up the stairs to the Louis XIV rooms. From here, you will enter the State Apartment rooms which eventually leads to the Hall of Mirrors. The Hall of Mirrors was my favorite room in the entire palace. It is a massive space with huge windows, a painted ceiling, and multiple sparkling chandeliers. The Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles Explore Le Marais When we got back to Paris, we decided to explore Le Marais, a chic, trendy spot that is known for being LGBQT+ friendly. It is a vibrant community with shops and restaurants that's located right on the Seine river. It's not a must-do, but definitely worth walking around if you have some extra time. We ate at this restaurant ( Les Deux Colombes), which had views of the famous Hotel de Ville Les Deux Colombes in Le Marais Montmartre Montmartre is known as the most romantic neighborhood of Paris and became my favorite area out of everything that we visited. It is what I always pictured when I envisioned the quintessential \"French neighborhood.\" It attracted a lot of artists back in the day, such as Ernest Hemingway and Picasso. Montmartre is also where you will find Moulin Rouge, where you can buy tickets to see live dancers perform cabaret shows. Update May 2024: I went back to Paris and finally checked Moulin Rouge off my bucket list! The show was absolutely incredible, and the theater is beautiful. However, I did not know that it was a topless cabaret show instead of a play! I was expecting something more like an NYC Broadway show. Overall, I would 100% recommend seeing it, but maaaybe leave your children at home... Moulin Rouge Montmartre Walking Tour - booked through the Paris Pass. A guide takes you up and down the streets of Montmartre and tells you about the history, landmarks, and other quintessential things you may not find on your own. This was the perfect way to familiarize ourselves with the city! The tour ends at Sacre Coeur Basilica, a massive Catholic church with stunning architecture. You are allowed to go inside the church and look around. Sacre Coeur Basilica Two minutes from the Sacre Coeur Basilica is a restaurant called Au Cadet de Gascogne, which was featured in the Paris Pass under \"Champagne Gourmand.\" Basically, you walk up, show them your pass, and they give you a glass of free champagne with a small tray of French pastries and desserts. Yes, you read that correctly. After walking the hills of Montmartre for the past hour and a half, it was the perfect way to relax. The best way to end a tour of Montmartre! Free Time Suggestions I technically had another full day in Paris after Day #3, but did not have an itinerary planned since I already knocked out the majority of the things I wanted to do. I decided to use this day as a \"chill day\" to really take it all in. If you find yourself with extra time and want to squeeze in a few other activities, here are my top suggestions: Taking a Seine river cruise ( Paris Pass) Cruises start every hour on the hour No need to make a reservation; however, there will likely be a long line! Multiple walking tours throughout the city ( Paris Pass) Hop on/hop off bus tour through the city ( Paris Pass) Musee d'Orsay - this is probably Paris's second-most famous museum (only to the Louvre). Set in what used to be one of Paris's main train stations. ( Paris Pass) Pere Lachaise Cemetery - Oscar Wilde is buried here! ( Paris Pass) Tour Palais Garnier, Paris's opera house Parks in Paris Most famous: Jardin du Luxembourg and Jardin des Tuileries Other parks: Parc des Buttes Chaumont, Bois de Vincennes And Lastly... Do a Champagne Crawl If you don't do a champagne crawl in Paris, did you even go to Paris? You can, of course, get more than just champagne at (most) of these places, but I would recommend indulging at least once in arguably the most famous drink of France. Pro Tip: A glass of champagne here is not nearly as expensive as you may think; in fact, a lot of it costs about the same as a glass of wine. (You can, of course, get crazy-expensive champagne if you're about that life!) Toasting to Montmartre at Au Cadet de Gascogne We ended up doing more than one champagne crawl due to the location of some of these places. I researched some of the top bars in Paris before I went, because I wanted not only the best drinks, but also the best aesthetics, and a little bit of cultural history. We also usually started our champagne crawl at the restaurant where we had dinner. For a list of the must-try cultural foods as well as my favorite restaurants I went to, check out the My Favorite Restaurants section on the \" Planning a Trip to Paris \" page. From rooftops with Eiffel Tower views to the first (and perhaps only!) TRUE champagne bar in Paris, here are my favorite bars, grouped in proximity to each other: The Champagne Crawl: My Favorite Bars Bars Near Our Hotel, Close to Arrondissement #8: The Buddha Bar - Asian-themed bar with expensive sushi. We did not order food, but the aesthetic (and champagne) were top-tier. Bar Hemingway - a small bar located in The Ritz Paris. Expect there to be a line, as seating is very limited. Hemingway frequented this bar (obviously!) Harry's New York Bar - this one has more of a sports-bar vibe. Not your traditional Paris flair; however, the staff was very nice and helpful with drink recommendations. This bar was actually Paris's first-ever cocktail bar, so we got more than just champagne here! Fun fact: The Bloody Mary and Sidecar were both invented at this bar! The stairs inside the Buddha Bar Harry's New York Bar Toasting to the Buddha Bar! Bars We Visited In Montmartre: Le Vrai Paris - Montmartre restaurant/bar with decorative flowers on the outside This could also be included in the restaurant list, as their food looked AMAZING, but we only got drinks here! Au Cadet de Gascogne - Montmartre bar with the free champagne from the Paris Pass Le Vrai Paris Bars Near The Eiffel Tower: Le Dokhan's Bar - Paris's original (and ONLY) champagne bar. Located inside the Dokhan's Hotel near Plaza del Trocadero. Fun fact: This place considers themselves Paris's only champagne bar because they are the only bar that exclusively serves just champagne! Le Rooftop at The Peninsula Hotel - rooftop bar with gorgeous Eiffel Tower views near Le Dokhan's. Drinks are pricey, but worth it IMO.

I am so happy and jealous of you. The feeling of visiting Tokyo for the first time is one of my fondest memories of all of my travels, by far. As a repeat visitor to this beautiful city, I will impart some of my knowledge of Tokyo in this post. Tokyo Tower from Skylobby at Azabudai Hill Planning your trip to Tokyo Travel Tips for First-time Visitors How to get to Tokyo Getting Wi-fi or Data SIM card in Tokyo Public Transport in Tokyo What is a JR Pass and do I need it? Where to stay in Tokyo Tokyo Itinerary, what to do and where to go 5-days Tokyo Itinerary Short Trips from Tokyo Want more? Here are more activities you can do in Tokyo Tokyo Travel Tips for First-time Visitors First things first, let's go through all the tips that can make your travel to Tokyo easier: 1. Download the Google Translate Japanese Pack to your phone. It will make communication a lot easier. Aside from text translations, Google Translate can also translate writings into English. It has been useful when I go to a restaurant where the entire menu is in Japanese and the staff does not speak English - I just use the camera function and translate the menu by taking a photo of it. 2. Download the Tokyo Google Maps to your phone - by this, I don't just mean download the Google Maps app. You can download the whole Tokyo map to your phone so you'll use less mobile data when browsing the maps. Here is how to download Maps to your phone. 3. Wear comfortable walking shoes - Tokyo is a city with amazing public transport connectivity. On the other hand, taxis are expensive in Tokyo. So chances are, you'll be walking and exploring on foot a lot during your time in Tokyo. Wear comfortable shoes that are actually made for walking, you'll thank me later. 4. Don't worry about traveling solo to Tokyo. Tokyo is one of the safest cities in the world. Two of my trips to Tokyo were done on my own and it couldn't have been more perfect. Okay, I know there are incidents involving perverted peeping toms on the train, and I'm sure crimes do still happen, but I personally have never felt scared or threatened even when I was walking alone at night. 5. Consider the Tokyo Pass from Klook to save money - There are lots of attractions to visit and do in Tokyo, which means you'll likely have to spend on tickets for those activities. Getting a travel pass like the Klook Tokyo Pass could ease the pain. To make it easier for you to decide whether to get the pass or not, I'll put a note on each attraction that I mention in the itinerary that could use the Tokyo pass. What is Klook? Klook is the leading travel and experiences booking website in Asia. And yes, they are legit! I personally always book my activities through them whenever I am traveling. See my review of Klook here. Red Lanterns in front of a Japanese restaurant 6. Do your customs and immigration procedures online - Visit Japan Webis Japan's online service for immigration procedures and customs declarations. Even though it is not required, it would be beneficial for you and everyone else to complete the procedures on Visit Japan Web before you arrive. It's free, fast, and all can be done online. How to use Visit Japan Web: Need help using Visit Japan Web? I have written an extensive guide about Visit Japan Web here. How to get to Tokyo There are two airports near Tokyo: Haneda Airport (HND) and Narita Airport (NRT). Both of them are international airports. 1. Narita vs Haneda I will always recommend flying to Haneda instead of Narita if you have the option. Why? Haneda is so much closer to the city than Narita. In fact, Haneda is actually in Tokyo - it would take you about 30 minutes to Shibuya using the local train. Narita, on the other hand, is located in Chiba. It takes about 40 to 90 minutes to get to Ueno and you need to buy a separate airport express ticket. But I'm not saying you should never fly into Narita. Sometimes it makes sense especially in terms of budget. I flew to Narita was when I took ZIPAIR budget airline from Singapore, and I think the price difference justified the extra hassle. 2. Getting to Tokyo from Haneda Airport By Local Train - If you are arriving in Haneda (HND), you'll want to take the local train as it is cost-effective. There is Tokyo Monorail which will take you to Hamamatsucho station, where you can transfer to the JR Yamanote line to your final destination. Or, you can take the Keikyu Airport Line which will take you to Shinagawa station, where you can transfer to other local lines to your final destination. Private Transfer Car from Haneda - If you're arriving in off hours (trains only operate from 6 AM to midnight) or traveling with a group with lots of luggage, you will want to book a Private Transfer from and to HND to save the hassle. 3. Getting to Tokyo from Narita Airport By Airport Express Train - Aside from the Narita Express, there is Tokyo Keisei Skyliner which takes you to Ueno station in 40 minutes. From Ueno, you can then transfer to the local trains to get to the station nearest to your hotel. Tokyo Pass: Keisei Narita Skyliner is one of the attractions included in Tokyo Pass Private Transfer Car from Narita - If you are traveling as a group or carrying a lot of luggage, I highly suggest getting a private car. On my most recent trip, I hired a private transfer car from Narita for the three of us since we had a lot of luggage and I had a great experience. The driver was already waiting for us as we exited and we were off within 5 minutes. The airport transfer company we booked via Klook is called CHINICHI. Our private transfer from Narita by CHINICHI via Klook Stay connected with Wi-Fi while in Tokyo If there is only one tip you take away from this blog. This would be it: Get a SIM card for your travel! Having an internet connection at all times makes traveling in Tokyo MUCH easier. There are a few Wi-Fi options you can consider: 1. Prepaid SIM Card - If you are traveling alone, you can look into getting a prepaid SIM card. You can pick up the SIM Card once you have reached Japan at the airport (check if your airport is listed). 2. Data eSIM - However, if you'd like to still be contactable from your original mobile number, I strongly suggest considering a data eSIM option. It will still allow you to have unlimited data when you are in Tokyo, but you can also retain your regular SIM card. 3. For group travel - If you are traveling in a group, or have multiple devices, another option is to rent a pocket Wi-Fi, which you can get here and pick up at the airport. This provides unlimited data and you can connect multiple devices to it, up to 10 devices. You'll have to remember to charge the router every day and also remember to return the router at the end of your trip. How many days should I spend in Tokyo? I recommend setting aside a minimum of 5 days forTokyo. Tokyo is MUCH bigger than you might have expected. On my first trip to Japan, I went for 7 days with aspirations of doing a few day trips outside of Tokyo. That plan was quickly trumped when I realized how big this city is. In the end, I allocated 5 days in Tokyo and barely managed to squeeze in two days in Hakone, and it was still not enough to cover all that I wanted to do in Tokyo. I ended up coming back a few more times and on subsequent return visits, I'm still discovering new sides of the city. And this is why I've written this post as a 5-day itinerary in Tokyo! How to get around Tokyo using Public Transport In Tokyo, you can pretty much get anywhere you want using the train. Here is how the system works: Tokyo Pass: A 72-hour subway ticket (for Tokyo Metro and Toei line) can be bought as an add-on to Tokyo Pass, making it cheaper than paying for a single train fare each time. 1. Using Local Trains with IC cards (SUICA or PASMO) Local trains in Japan run on IC (Integrated Circuit) Cards. In Tokyo, you can get either SUICA or PASMO IC card. They are the exact same thing, and there is no difference in which one you get so just pick one. Whichever one you choose, this IC card will be your lifeline during your stay. Virtual IC Card: For iPhone users, you can use your phone to pay for train fares. No need for physical IC card! Read here to find how to get around in Tokyo without physical IC Card. This card allows you to tap in and out of each train station without having to buy a ticket every single time you take a train. And because everyone has an IC card Japan, you can even use your card balance to buy things from convenience stores and vending machines. Whenever the balance is running low, you can easily refill the card using cash or credit card at any train station. 2. Virtual IC Card - How to use your iPhone as an IC Card in Japan Good news for iPhone users - the IC cards have gone virtual and you can use your phone as an IC card. This makes everything even more convenient, as you can refill the balance via your phone without going to the station. Tip: Check out Apple's help article on how to use IC cards on iPhones. You do not need to buy a physical IC card to do this, just start the process straight from your phone! However, if you DO have an existing IC card you can still transfer the balance to your phone. Your existing card will then stop working and you can only use your phone as an IC card from that point onwards. Unfortunately for Android users, the phone needs to be bought in Japan to be able to do this. You could try using the Pasmo mobile, but it is only available in Japanese. For users without a smartphone, you would still need to get a physical IC card. 3. Planning your route in Tokyo In terms of train schedules and routes, I'm happy to report that Google Maps works well in Japan. You can use it as you normally would when looking up directions, but set it to public transport mode and it will give you the best way to get from point A to point B by train. And it even tells you how much the fare would be. Example Tokyo Train Route on Google Maps - Shinjuku to Asakusa I'd say that's good enough for tourists. Locals use a more comprehensive transit app called NaviTime which will tell you even more details such as which train car you should board to get to your transfer faster. But for me, Google Maps has always been enough. 4. Tokyo local trains will stop running at midnight Trains in Tokyo are convenient and affordable, but they stop at midnight. Cabs are very expensive in Tokyo, so if you're out late, you want to make sure you still catch the last train. Most stations have trains running until midnight but as a general rule of thumb, you should be at the station by 11:30 PM. Especially if your travel involves changing lines. On one of our nights out, we missed our last connecting train in Shibuya and had to take a cab back to our accommodation. The short 20-minute ride cost us $50 5. Be mindful of train peak hour I try to stay away from using the train in the morning during rush hour, usually any time from 8-10 am on a weekday and 6-8 pm on weeknights. I'm sure you've heard about how people get pushed by sticks to encourage them to move more inside the train so that more people can get on, and you end up packed into the train like sardines. What is a JR Pass and do I need it? If you're only staying in Tokyo, you don't need to get a JR Pass. An IC Card will be enough to take trains within Tokyo. However, if you're planning to venture out of Tokyo to other cities, then you might want to look into JR Pass so you can save on train ticket costs. What is JR Pass: Read about JR Pass to find out what it is and whether you need it for your visit to Japan. Where to stay in Tokyo With Tokyo's extensive train system, anywhere close to a train station is a great place to stay. For a first-timer, I'd try to stay close to Shibuya, Shinjuku, or Asakusa. Look for a place within 15-minute walking distance or close to a train line that can take you to these areas. Here are a few places I would recommend in Tokyo, in different price ranges: 1. Affordable Accommodations Reso Poshtel in Asakusa ($) - I stayed at a dorm in Asakusa and shared a room with 5 other women for a few nights. It was a great way to keep accommodation costs down if you are traveling alone and plan to be outside most of the time anyway. That hostel has since closed down, but Reso Poshtel looks similar. Hotel 1899 Tokyo in Shimbashi ($$) - Very conveniently located near the Shimbashi station, which is a good base for exploring the city. 2. Mid-range Accommodation MUJI Hotel in Ginza ($$$) - If you're a fan of the minimalist Japanese home goods brand MUJI, you've got to stay at this hotel. The rooms are decorated with that classic Japanese feel, similar to how the MUJI stores look like. The hotel is next to the flagship MUJI store, located conveniently in Ginza, one of the major stations in Tokyo. The Strings by Intercontinental in Shinagawa ($$$) - This one is a more expensive option as I stayed here during a business trip, but this hotel was convenient. It's right on top of Shinagawa station, which is close to both Shibuya and Haneda Airport. There are several convenience stores and a shopping mall in the same complex as the hotel. Also, it's one of the taller buildings in this area. On a clear day, you can see Mount Fuji. 3. Luxury Accommodation Hotel Gajoen Tokyo in Meguro ($$$$) - If you want a taste of old Japanese luxury while in Tokyo, then look no further than this hotel. This beautiful yet little-known hotel is located in Meguro. I did not know this hotel even existed until my very recent visit to Tokyo, where I wanted to visit an exhibit within the hotel. I was blown away by how beautiful the hotel is! Supposedly, it's the hotel that inspired the popular anime Spirited Away. The Ritz Carlton Tokyo in Roppongi ($$$$) - Conveniently located in Roppongi, The Ritz in Tokyo is a great option. The lobby is located on the 53rd floor, which means all their room will give you a great view of Tokyo from above! The Tokyo 5-Day Itinerary Tokyo is a massive metropolitan city. It's worth planning your trip and grouping the days by areas so that you don't waste time. This is the basis of how I've structured the itineraries below - I've put together some must-visits in sections based on their proximity to each other so that you can optimize your trip by choosing which sights you want to visit on the same day. Please note that these itineraries are not meant to be done chronologically so you can mix and match your days. Also, don't feel bad if you did not get to do everything... It's just an excuse to come back to Tokyo Here are quick shortcuts to the itinerary for each day: Day 1: Yoyogi Park, Harajuku, Omotesando, and Roppongi Day 2: Shibuya and its surrounding areas Day 3: Akihabara, Ueno Park, and Asakusa Day 4: Shinjuku Day 5: Tuna Auction, Ginza, Imperial Castle and Shrines Day 6 Onward: Take day trips (or short trips) away from Tokyo Want more? Here are other Activities you can do in Tokyo To visualize this Tokyo itinerary better, I've created a Google Maps link that marks all the routes and landmarks I'll mention in this blog.

Click here for instructions on how to view the map later. It will work from your phone too. And FINALLY here is a detailed list of what to do in Tokyo on your first visit: Day 1: Yoyogi Park, Harajuku, Omotesando, and Roppongi Tip: Choose a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) for this itinerary. The places I'm going to mention today are better to be visited on weekends! 1. Visit Yoyogi Park and Meiji Jingu You can start your day by exploring Yoyogi Park. It's a huge park with a pleasant shaded walk and all of the walking routes will go through Meiji Jingu, a beautiful Shinto shrine, where you can buy an amulet and other traditional souvenirs. Don't forget to do the water purification ritual at the temple entrance. Every temple in Japan will have a small fountain with some wooden ladles. Take some water using the ladle, then transfer some of that water to your hands and use it to wash your mouth. Do NOT use the ladle directly to wash your mouth! If you're visiting on a weekend, you might even see a Shinto wedding there as well. I was lucky enough to see one when I visited. The Meiji Shrine Prayer boards at Meiji Jingu A Shinto wedding at Meiji Jingu 2. Explore Harajuku Next, you can check out Harajuku, a walkable distance from Yoyogi Park (it's actually right across from it), and walk along Takeshita Dori. Harajuku embodies everything you've heard about modern Japan - It's a crazy area filled with people, trendy shops, and street food. Harajuku became well-known as the hangout spot for the trendy youngsters who would wear their most outrageous, fashion-forward outfits. Sadly, this is a dying culture and they're not seen as often as they used to, so to increase your chance of spotting these trendsetters you might want to visit on a weekend. I can easily spend 2-3 hours in Harajuku just walking and looking at the various shops. I recommend dropping by Laforet, a shopping center at the end of Takeshita Dori. Harajuku is full of unusual fashion items on its own, but Laforet is probably the center of all the crazy fashion. And you've got to try Japanese Crepes while you're here! That's what the Harajuku area is known for. There are also a bunch of other cute eats on the street, such as the animal-shaped gelato from Eiswelt Gelato. If you're keen to try the viral I'm Donut? donuts, there is a branch in Harajuku as well. They're known for their mochi-like donuts and long queue. I personally wouldn't queue for it, but I was lucky to pass by there once when there were only 3-4 people in line. Harajuku's Takeshita Dori 3. Omotesando, Aoyama & Roppongi If you keep walking along Takeshita Dori towards the east, you'll end up in Omotesando, Aoyama, and then Roppongi. In total, this is about a 3km walk from Harajuku station and very pedestrian friendly. The entire route is lined up with shops and food. Here are some notable places you can stop by on your walk: Tokyu Plaza Omotesando Harajuku for a quick photo op too. This building has these geometric-shaped mirrors on the ceiling and it makes for an amazing picture. MoMA Design Store Omotesando - MoMA is the Museum of Modern Arts in NYC, but they have a few stores in Tokyo selling some of the best-rated items. Nezu Museum in Aoyama - East Asian art museum with a private collection Tokyu Plaza Omotesando Harajuku Tokyu Plaza Omotesando Harajuku 4. Roppongi Hills I recommend ending your day at the Tokyo City View Observation Deck in Roppongi Hills where you can take the lift up to the rooftop and get an amazing view of the city, including the iconic red Tokyo tower, for just 1,800 yen. If you're lucky and the day is clear, you might even see Mount Fuji! I recommend going close to sunset to get the best lighting for photos. Make sure you stay a little bit after sunset too for nighttime photography. You can book the Tokyo City View Observation Deck Admission Tickethere, which I recommend since it's cheaper than buying on the spot. Tokyo Pass: The Tokyo City View is one of the attractions included in Tokyo Pass At the rooftop of Tokyo Skydeck in Roponggi Sunset from the Tokyo Sky Deck roof top Tokyo Tower from the Sky Deck Previously, it was also possible to top up your ticket to visit the Sky Deck, which is an outdoor rooftop area. However, the Sky Deckis unfortunately closed from September 2023. If you are a museum person, Mori Art Museum is also in the same building, and access to the permanent exhibition is included with the observation deck ticket. They might have an interesting exhibit to check out too, but you need to buy the ticket separately. But if you are a fan of Japanese wood interior design, then head to Tokyo Midtown in Roppongi, the most aesthetic mall I've been to. It also has great stores to get souvenirs from. Where to eat and drink in Harajuku, Omotesando, Aoyama, and Roppongi Japanese Crepes at Harajuku. This can be found all throughout the famous Takeshita Dori in Harajuku, so just snap them up whenever you see a stall. It wouldn't be a very big stall, usually just enough for one person to serve you the crepes through the stall window. You can customize your crepe with different fruit toppings and sweet syrup. Zaku Zaku Ice Cream.\"Zaku-zaku\" is Japanese onomatopoeia for something crispy/crunchy (I swear, Japanese people have sounds for everything). As soon as you enter the shop, you can smell a delicious buttery sweet and savory aroma wafting in the air - similar to caramel popcorn but BETTER. This place is actually famous for its creampuff, filled with Hokkaido cream which is made fresh on the spot and coated with their crispy 'croquant' made from baked almonds. But the Harajuku store also has an ice cream version that is exclusive to this branch. Eiswelt Gelato on Harajuku - This shop has the cutest animal-shaped gelato! Take note though, It's only open on weekends. Maisen Tonkatsu at Omotesando Maisen Tonkatsu in Omotesando ( maps). While walking around Omotesando, be sure to stop by here for one of the best tonkatsu in town. Their specialty is Kurobuta aka the Japanese black pork. Their tonkatsu set can get pretty pricey, but there are cheaper alternatives such as the cutlet rice bowl. Sincere Garden for a vegetarian option in Omotesando ( maps). My friends will be surprised I'm recommending a vegetarian restaurant, yet here we are. Long story short, I made a friend at the hostel I was staying at in Asakusa and ended up tagging along for lunch with him and his Tokyo friends. We ended up at this vegetarian place that serves all organic food in Omotesando. For someone who loves meat as much as I do, this was actually a very decent meal! I feel that it fits perfectly with the trendy vibe of Omotesando. The entire cafe has this light wooden theme and made me feel good about eating healthy food. Tempuraya Miyagawa in Aoyama ( maps) - A small establishment offering tempura set at lunch and omakase multi-course tempura at dinner. I think it's better to go during lunch, but dinner should be great too. Tokyo Whisky Library ( maps) - Great place to try whisky if you're a fan, including the famous Japanese whisky. Day 2: Shibuya and its surrounding areas (Ebisu, Nakameguro, Daikanyama, and Shimokitazawa) For this day, we will be exploring Shibuya, one of the major areas of Tokyo. This itinerary can be done any day, on weekdays, or on weekends. 1. The Famous Shibuya Scramble Crossing Check out Shibuya for the famous Shibuya Scramble Crossing, where every few minutes the pedestrian light turns green and the entire crossing will be filled with a ton of people coming from all directions. The famous Shibuya Scramble Crossing Located just outside the Shibuya station, this crossing has been featured in many movies, video games, and music videos. It's an unusual scene and the true definition of organized chaos - everybody is going everywhere in all directions but amazingly, nobody is bumping into each other. I recommend doing this during the day to see the craziness in all its glory. There is a famous Starbucks where people love to sit and watch the scramble crossing from, but I find it to be quite crowded so I prefer to just watch from ground zero (plus it's free!). Shibuya Scramble Crossing from the 46th Floor of Shibuya Sky 2. Statue of Hachiko, the loyal dog At one corner of the scramble crossing, you can check out the famous Hachiko Statue. Hachiko is a legendary Japanese dog who is famous for being extremely loyal. He kept waiting for his owner's return at the train station, years after he had passed away. His loyalty touched the heart of many Japanese and he has become immortalized in front of Shibuya station, waiting forever for his owner. Shibuya is a major train station and it can get pretty confusing when you are trying to meet up with friends, so the Hachiko statue has become a famous meeting point. Hachiko, the loyal dog 3. Shibuya Sky Observation Deck If you fancy seeing Tokyo from above, the Shibuya Sky observation deck is a great choice. This is one of the newest observation decks in Tokyo, having opened to the public in early 2020, and in my opinion the best view of Tokyo from above that you can get at the moment. It is currently the most popular observation deck in Tokyo, you'll need to book tickets ahead of time. You can read my post about visiting Shibuya Sky for more information. Yoyogi Park from Shibuya Sky Tokyo Pass: The Shibuya Sky observation deck is one of the attractions included in Tokyo Pass 4. Shopping in Shibuya You can take your time exploring more of Shibuya. It's a huge shopping district and you can even say it's the center of Tokyo, along with Shinjuku. Check out Shibuya Loft for floors of random home goodies, each floor with its own theme. You can also check out Don Quijote (aka Donki) for even more random stuff, or Nitori for home goodies similar to IKEA. For general shopping, I recommend checking out Hikarie building, which features lots of Japanese brands and goodies you can buy for yourself or loved ones at home. Famous 109 Shibuya Building. This exact angle was featured in one of my favorite video games - The World Ends With You. 5. Nightlife in Dogenzaka If you are tired or shopping is not your thing, I recommend going to Dogenzaka area. Formerly a yakuza hangout, Dogenzaka is now filled with ramen shops, pubs, izakaya (small stalls selling skewered meats), and even... love hotels. It's a good place to be if you are there for the nightlife. Dogenzaka at night 6. Neighborhoods near the Shibuya area If you still have some energy after the madness that is Shibuya, you can take the train to Shimokitazawa, Daikanyama, Naka-Meguro, or Ebisu for some cafes and check out the nightlife. These are more laid-back residential areas. Tip: You can check out my Daikanyama Guide for more information on what you can find and do in Daikanyama. Chilled-out streets of Shimokitazawa. There was even ambient music playing on a loudspeaker Dolce Tacubo in Daikanyama Where to eat in Shibuya and its surroundings Ichiran Ramen in Shibuya ( maps) for the famous Tonkotsu Ramen from a vending machine. Basically, you go up to a vending machine outside the restaurant, punch in your order, receive a ticket based on your order, make payment, then wait to get seated in your own personal cubicle to slurp on your ramen. They have many other branches around the city, so you don't have to eat this in Shibuya. Katsukichi Bodaijyu in Shibuya ( maps) - Tonkatsu is one of the most popular meals in Japan, so you have to try it at least once while you are here, and if you eat pork. As a bonus, I love the decor of this place. Kushiyaki Bistro Fukumimi in Dogenzaka ( maps) - If you want to experience an izakaya (bar) in Tokyo, this is the place to go. Gyukatsu Motomura in Shibuya ( maps) - This place seats only 8 people at a time and you eat at the counter. There are two branches in Shibuya that are within 10-minute walk of each other, but they are both popular. Even though I came here at 2 PM, the line was still very long. They are famous for Gyukatsu, which is deep-fried and breaded beef. You'll also get a personal stone stove which you can use to further grill your beef slices to the desired doneness. Shiro-Hige Cream Puff Factory in Shimokitazawa ( maps) - Located a short walk away from Shimokitazawa station and tucked inside a very quiet residential area, this cafe is known for its Totoro-shaped Creampuff. The creampuff costs 420 yen each. I recommend having the creampuffs to go bc there is an extra fee for having it at the cafe (it becomes 465 yen). They come in four flavors (custard, chocolate, strawberry and green tea) but I personally think the regular custard one is the best. My Okonomiyaki at Hiroki in Shimokitazawa Hiroki in Shimokitazawa ( maps) for Okonomiyaki in Shimokitazawa. There are only 8 seats in this hole-in-the-wall restaurant. For each Okonomiyaki, you get to pick soba or udon as the noodle base, then add on toppings as you want. There was no English menu (UPDATE: I have been told there is now an English menu!). Try to sit on the counter if you can, this is where you can watch the action as it happens. The chef will cook and mix your Okonomiyaki for you according to order and once done, he will push it to the hot plate area in front of you so the Okonomiyaki stays warm as you eat it off the counter's hot plate. I also highly suggest visiting Daikanyama for one of your meals. Daikanyama has been dubbed the Brooklyn of Tokyo and they have tons of cool restaurants and cafes - you can check out my Daikanyama guide here Ebisu Yokocho in Ebisu ( maps) - This was a random surprise find for me. I was just aimlessly walking around Ebisu when I decided to go into a random building that seemed very unassuming on the outside. Once inside, I was greeted with a lively atmosphere of people eating and drinking in rows upon rows of small restaurants. Sure enough, none of them had an English menu, but just put on your brave face and try something new. I randomly chose a modern sushi joint and was able to order with my very limited Japanese. I ended up with a plate of beef and mushroom sushi... which is interesting as that's not what you'd normally expect. The lively Ebisu Yokocho Day 3: Akihabara, Ueno Park, and Asakusa Tips: Try to do this itinerary on a Sunday, since Akihabara streets are car-free on Sundays from 1-6 pm 1. Akihabara As a first-time Tokyo visitor, you HAVE to check out Akihabara to experience firsthand all the unique and unusual things you've heard about Japan - the infamous Maid cafe, cat cafes, electronics, comic books, and floors and floors of arcade games, just to name a few. If you go on a Sunday, they close up the street from cars and open it up for pedestrians so you can roam around freely. Akihabara on a Sunday car-free day Video games and cafes at Akihabara 2. Asakusa and Ueno Park Then once you're done with Akihabara, you can walk to Ueno Park for an afternoon stroll. If that's not your thing, then you can head straight to Asakusa. Asakusa is a backpacker district so there are lots of cheap food and shopping you can do here. Check out Senso-ji, a famous Buddhist temple. There is a cool street in front of this temple, called Nakamise Shopping Street, which has lots of street food you can try and souvenir stalls (PS: This was where one of my earliest Girl Eat World shots was taken). If history is your thing, the Edo-Tokyo Museum is also near this area. Black Sesame Agemanju from Nakamise Street Nakamise Shopping Street in front of the Asakusa Sensoji Temple I went to a smaller shrine and found a mikoshi! The small festival around the temple 3. Tokyo Skytree Observation Deck Tokyo Skytree is currently the primary television and radio broadcast of the Kanto region. When Tokyo Skytree was built in 2010, it became the tallest structure in Japan. At its full height of 634m, it also became the tallest tower in the world. Early Bird Ticket is cheaper! There is a 300-400 yen discount if you buy the ticket online ahead of time. Buying tickets on the same day is more expensive. Tokyo Skytree is located only 20 minutes away from Asakusa, so it's a great option if you're looking for an observatory and haven't been to one on this trip. View from Tembo Deck at Tokyo Skytree The area is also a great choice to spend a few hours in - aside from the observation decks, there are also the Sumida Aquarium, Tenku Planetarium, and shopping malls with great food options at the bottom of SkyTree Tower. Where to eat Beerbal NAGAOKAYA ( maps) - I actually came across their stall while I was at Fuji Rock Festival through an acquaintance's recommendation. Their lamb chops were seriously the best I've had. I still dream about it, so I stalked them down and found out that they have a restaurant/beer garden in Ueno. Please give them a visit and let me know how you like it! Day 4: Explore Shinjuku Shinjuku is a major area in Tokyo. It has offices, pubs, restaurants, and izakayas. If you've seen that iconic photo of a street in Japan filled with neon lights (like the one below) it was probably taken in Shinjuku. Shinjuku deserves its own itinerary because this area is massive. A typical sight in Shinjuku Here is what you can do in Shinjuku: 1. Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden Start your day with a walk at Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for a peaceful stroll. The park is just a short walk from Shinjuku station. Autumn in Shinjuku Gyoen Shinjuku Gyoen is especially popular during the Sakura season in spring and Momiji season in the fall. There is an entry fee of 500 yen for every adult, but kids 15 and under can enter for free. If you ask me, it's worth every cent! You can use your IC card to enter the park or buy a ticket at the entrance. Japanese Garden in Shinjuku Gyoen The park has great amenities - clean restrooms, vending machines with hot and cold drinks, plenty of food options, snacks, and even Starbucks inside the park. 2. Go up Tokyo Metropolitan Building for a free observatory Sitting at 202 meters above ground at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building (or Tocho for short), the observatory is free for the public. There is a cafe at the observatory where you can get drinks and soft serve, as well as a souvenir shop. Best skyline view of Tokyo: Read my round-up on the best places to get a nice view in Tokyo here. Tokyo Metropolitan Government Observatory 3. Visit Omoide Yokocho First, visit Omoide Yokocho. \"Omoide\" means memory and \"Yokocho\" is a lane / small alley, so loosely translated as you are walking down memory lane... everything here feels nostalgic, traditional Japan. There are tons of little stalls (izakaya) and while most don't have anyEnglish menu, some have pictures. I suggest going with Google Translate if you plan to know everything you are eating. Otherwise, just point your fingers and be surprised. They mostly serve small skewered meats but be warned that they aren't exactly cheap. You can drink beer or whiskey highball here too. Omoide Yokocho Me and my new friends at a small izakaya! Just kidding, I was eating alone The result of pointing randomly at food photos at an izakaya 4. Golden Gai After the show, you can head over to Golden Gai for some nightlife. This area was super cool! It was filled with tiny bars with different themes, so you can easily bar hop to your heart's content - provided you are fine that each bar will have a cover charge of $5-10. My friends and I at the now defunct Robot Restaurant in Golden Gai Shinjuku While Tokyo is generally safe, Golden Gai might be an area where you want to be a bit more alert as the area could be tourist trappy and you might run into unsavory crowds. They also do not like photos taken within the area of Golden Gai. A couple of iPhone shots are probably okay, but do not go there and snap photos with a camera gear. If you are staying out late, keep in mind the last train in Tokyo is just before midnight so you have to make sure you are on the train platform by then. Or else you will have to fork out some cash for the taxi ride back home. Where to eat/go in Shinjuku Tatsukichi ( maps). We went for dinner based on a local Tokyo friend's recommendation. They were quite packed during dinner so be prepared to wait. It's an omakase-style restaurant, meaning they will just keep serving you whatever they are cooking until you ask for the bill. Their specialty is Kushiage - deep-fried vegetable/meat skewers - and although it might seem daunting and unhealthy to eat fried food for a meal, I swear all of them were good, super crispy, and not overly oily. With each skewer, the chef will tell you which sauce to use. If I remember correctly, we each spent S$50 after 10-12 skewers and 2 whiskey highballs. Tsukemen Gonokami ( maps) Tatsunoya Tsukemen One of the deep-fried veggies at Tasukichi Day 5: Tuna Auction, Ginza, Imperial Castle and Shrines For this day, you'll start your day early to see the famous fish market in Tokyo, followed by visiting cultural sites such as the Imperial Castle and a few shrines around the area. 1. Tuna Auction at Toyosu Fish Market If you love food, visiting fish markets in Tokyo is a must. It's not that they have the best sushi in Tokyo, it's that you can't beat the atmosphere at the fish market. Fishermen arrive at the crack of dawn with their daily catch, and most importantly - the Tuna auction, where sushi tycoons have been known to bid crazy amounts of money for the best fish - the most expensive Tuna ever paid was $800,000! The center of this fishermen's activity used to be at Tsukiji Market, but as of October 2018, the tuna viewing and the wholesale market have been moved to Toyosu Market. I have not been to Toyosu yet - I heard it's massive, sterile-looking, and modern compared to the old Tsukiji, but I reckon it's still worth visiting. Tsukiji Market after the crazy morning bustle If you want to see the Tuna auction, you'll have to come to Toyosu Market very early at 5 AM. You can then watch the auction from a gallery above which is open to the public. You do not need a ticket for the gallery, but if you want to watch the auction from a closer point of view, you'll need to enter a lottery. You can do so here. After the auction, you can go for an amazing breakfast of freshly made sushi. There are some sushi stalls worth checking out at Toyosu. The crowd's favorite is Sushi Dai and Sushi Daiwa. But if you're like me and don't want to queue, then honestly? Just pick a random stall with the shortest queue. I did exactly this and it turned out just fine - the sushi I had was delicious! You can either order a sushi set or do an omakase set, where the chef will serve you whatever sushi they can make with the ingredients they have for the day. Tuna Auction and Toyosu Market Tour: It can be a little intimidating to visit the fish market by yourself, so I do recommend joining the Tuna auction tour which will give you a guide and a tour to the fish market. Take note that the market is closed on Sundays and Japanese public holidays, so check before you go. I tried to go during one of their public holidays and had to come back the next day. If you don't mind a bit of travel, I recommend checking out the sushi stalls at Tsukiji Outer Market for the original fish market vibe. 16-piece sushi for breakfast? Why not! For the record, I finished them all by myself 2. Visit teamLab Exhibitions - teamLab Borderless and teamLab Planets In the past decade, teamLab has established itself to be at the forefront of the digital interactive art scene. Their installations are always a delight to see and interact with. I'm lucky there is a permanent teamLab exhibition in Singapore so I'm not a stranger to their work, but I still made the time to check out their Tokyo exhibitions. teamLab Borderless - Forest of resonating lamps There are two teamLab exhibitions in Tokyo, teamLab Borderless and teamLab Planets. teamLab Borderless was temporarily closed, but has reopened by February 2024 in the new Azabudai Hills area. teamLab Planets is still open with plans to close it in 2027, after which it might close down to move to another location as well. Buy tickets ahead: These exhibitions are very popular, so you will want to purchase tickets and book timeslots for visiting teamLab Planets and teamLab Borderless ahead of time via Klook. It's a direct QR code entry so you don't need to buy tickets when you get there. Tokyo Pass: Both teamLab Planets and teamLab Borderless are included in Tokyo Pass In terms of which one to visit - both of them share similar themes (interactive digital arts) but very different experiences. teamLab Borderless is probably more famous since they're more visually appealing, but teamLab Planets are more interactive. One of the exhibitions in teamLab Planets Both exhibitions are time-based, meaning you need to book a time slot to visit. I suggest picking a time when it's off hours if you want to avoid the crowd - try going early when they first open. Weekends or public holidays are definitely a no-go. I happened to be there during peak time and spent 40 minutes lining up outside. 3. Ginza Once done with the teamLab exhibition, you can walk back in the direction of the train station and walk around Ginza for high-end shopping. For the lovers of Japanese clothing brands MUJI and Uniqlo, you'll be happy to know that both Uniqlo and MUJI have their global flagship store located in Ginza, along with the famous MUJI hotel. On weekend and public holiday afternoons, the main street in Ginza is closed for cars so pedestrian can take a stroll on the street. 4. Tokyo Station You could also stop by Tokyo Station, which is only one station away from Ginza. It's weird to be visiting a station, I know, but the BASEMENT of Tokyo station is seriously a gem. There is Tokyo Ramen Street, Tokyo Character Street, and Tokyo Food Street. What might be of interest to most people is probably Tokyo Character Street, where you can find beloved characters like Hello Kitty, Pokemon, Studio Ghibli characters, etc. Take note most of the character shops close by 8:30 PM. Also, Tokyo Station is an excellent place for omiyage (gift) shopping for stuff you can bring back home, so it's great to hit up on your last day. 5. Imperial Castle, Atago Shrine and Hie Shrine If you want something a bit more traditional Japan, visit the Imperial Castle which is also nearby. Or, you could climb the Stairway of Success at Atago Shrine. Supposedly, the 86 steps represent the journey to success, and to this day, many would come to pray for their professional success at Atago Shrine. Atago Shrine in Tokyo Stairway of Success at Atago Shrine Another shrine you can visit that is in the vicinity is Hie Shrine, a Shinto shrine in Akasaka. Not many visitors know about this shrine, but I visited on the first day of the new year and the shrine was packed with locals doing Hatsumode, their first prayer of the new year. Hie Shrine in Akasaka The main draw of this shrine for me is the rows of torii at the back entraince of the shrine. It reminds me of Kyoto ! Torii at Hie Shrine Where to eat Rokurinsha in Tokyo Station ( maps) - Tsukemen is a type of ramen that's served cold and with a separate broth for the noodles to be dipped into. Rokurinsha is a Tsukemen shop located in the basement of Tokyo station, and it's a classic beloved by tourists and locals. Expect a long queue unless you're going at an off-hour and on weekdays. I went here on a Wednesday at 8 pm and waited 30 minutes in line. But really though, it was worth every minute. If you find the queue is too long, you can come back here again on the Day 5 itinerary (scroll down below) OR you can have it on your way out of Japan if you are flying through Haneda airport. Onigiriya Marutoyo at Tsukiji Outer Market ( maps) Ginza Bairin Main Shop ( Maps) Ningyocho Imahan Ginza ( Maps) Short trips from Tokyo: Easy Day trips and excursions What to mix up the Tokyo metropolitan city life with nature, temple visits, and countryside living? Good news for you! There are plenty of options that can be reached in just under 3 hours from Tokyo. These options are perfect for a short weekend trip, or even day trips for some of them. You could visit Hakone, Nikko, Lake Kawaguchi, just to name a few. Check it out: I've done a round-up of my recommended short-trip destinations from Tokyo here. You'll find all the places I love that can be conveniently reached from Tokyo. View of Mount Fuji from Arakuyama Sengen Park The famous Heiwa no Torii at Hakone Shrine Nikko National Park Toshogu Some of the best short trips from Tokyo can be found in this post More things to do in Tokyo and places worth visiting If you still have time to spend in Tokyo and wondering what else you can do, here are some of my recommendations for activities in Tokyo: 1. Take a Sunset Cruise around the Tokyo Bay Symphony Cruise is a cruising company that runs multiple cruises around the Tokyo Bay. Starting from Hinode Pier, you'll be able to take a 2-hour cruise while being served a 5-course fine dining meal. It's a great way to spend an afternoon in Tokyo. Dive deeper: Read my experience onboard their sunset cruise here Sunset Cruise around the Tokyo Bay 2. Go on a ramen tour around Tokyo You can't come to Japan and not try ramen. If you're a fan of this comforting noodle dish, definitely try this Tokyo Ramen Tour. I went on this tour during one of my visits to Tokyo. Although I've had plenty of ramen in my life, they were mostly Tonkotsu ramen (pork bone broth). I learned a lot about other types of ramen from Frank's tour. My tip? Come with an empty stomach. Seriously, because you'll be trying many different types of ramen during your visit - up to 6 bowls of tasting-portion ramen. I was so stuffed (but happy) by the time we were done with the tour. Book Tokyo Ramen Tour here 3. Eat Onigiri from any Japanese Konbini (Convenience Store) Convenience stores (called \"Konbini\" in Japanese) are an integral part of Japanese cities. The Konbini's that can be commonly found in Japan are Family Mart (Famima for short), Lawsons, 7/11, and Daily Yamazaki. My fondest memory of Japan has always been going into a Konbini first thing in the morning to see what Onigiri they have that day. Onigiri is this triangle-shaped rice wrapped in seaweed and stuffed with various fillings, perfect to eat as a snack on the go. My personal favorite is the salmon onigiri. There is something magical about the combination of salmon, rice, and seaweed. Rows of neatly stacked Onigiri - my personal heaven 4. The original Midori Sushi at Umegaoka Eating sushi while you are in Japan is undeniably a must-do. While staying at an Airbnb apartment in Tokyo, I got to know one of my roommates, a Japanese guy who kindly offered to drive me to his favorite local sushi joint. It's called Midori Sushi - they are famous for being affordable yet offering high-quality food. Loooooooong tailed sushi at Midori sushi They have a few branches in Tokyo, but the original one is at Umegaoka and is located in a very local residential area. They are famous for shaping their nigiri such that the meat topping forms this very long \"tail\", much longer than normal. 5. Visit Studio Ghibli Museum Any Japanese anime fan must visit the Studio Ghibli Museum. I went here on my very first visit to Tokyo as I am a huge fan. The museum is located in Mitaka - not too far away from Shibuya. At the studio, you can see their early sketches, watch a short animation, and buy some Ghibli merchandise. It's a bit small though so I would say you only need to set aside 2 hours for this museum. Visiting Studio Ghibli Museum as an English-speaking tourist has gotten easier over the years. A few years ago, you could only get tickets in person at a Lawson's branch and the instructions were all in Japanese. Lucky for you, these days Studio Ghibli tickets can be booked online (and in English too). You can read here for instructions on how to obtain a ticket, but you still have to book this a month in advance and book for a specific day and time slot. And yes, Studio Ghibli is popular and tickets DO sell out a month in advance. If it has sold out online, you can try getting them as part of a tour here: Ghibli Museum Tour. As a bonus, you'll get to visit the beautiful Hotel Gajoen as well! 6. Shop Japanese Brands and a variety of stores I love shopping for random goods while in Japan, especially for home goods. On my recent trip, I discovered LOFT at Shibuya and I was just blown away by the sheer amount of shopping you can do there! They sell everything and anything, from home goods, kitchen wares, stationeries, and clothing. Another similar shop is Tokyu Hands. I also love checking out eclectic discount stores like Don Quijote and Daiso, guaranteed to be fun and easy on your wallet. They carry everything from snacks to home goods and skin care. Living in Singapore, we have a lot of Daiso and Donki stores, but the experience in Japan is still different. If you like home goods, you might be interested to check out Nittori. They are like IKEA, but Japanese. If you're into shoes, you can't miss ABC Mart, the best shop for kicks in Japan. They have regular ABC Mart, and ABC Mart Grandstage for more premium shoes. I bought some Nikes when I was in Tokyo - they are much cheaper than in Singapore. And of course, you should check out the famous Japanese clothing brands like Uniqlo and MUJI, even if you have them in your home country. They are usually about 20% cheaper in Japan. 7. Visit the Lucky Cat temple in Gotokuji Just a few stops away from Shinjuku, you can find a lovely neighborhood called Gotokuji, where you can find cat-themed items and pastries, as well as a temple filled with Maneki Neko figurines. Read about my visit to Gotokuji Temple here Maneki Neko at Gotokuji Temple 8. Eat all the delicious food in Tokyo Tokyo is a great city for foodies. There are so much good food in this city! While I already have a lot of food recommendations baked into the itinerary above, if your main interest is food, you will want to check out my dedicated Tokyo Food Guide post. I listed 20 dishes you will want to try when you're in the city and where to have them! Tempura Soba Set, just one of the many delicious food you can have in Tokyo 9. Visit Hotel Gajoen - the \"museum hotel\" I know you're probably wondering why I'm recommending you to visit a hotel when you're in Tokyo. But trust me on this - Hotel Gajoen is truly a special hotel. Supposedly, it's the hotel that inspired the aesthetic of the popular anime \"Spirited Away\". Hotel Gajoen Lobby I only came across this hotel on what must be my 7th or 8th visit to Tokyo, and only because I happened to be working nearby at AWS Loft in Meguro. I thought I'd just drop by quickly for the Hina doll exhibit, but I ended up staying at the hotel for hours and snapped so many pictures because the entire hotel is so beautiful! Hotel Gajoen Lobby And yes, Hyakudan Kaidan (Hundred steps), located in the hotel lobby, is very much worth a visit as well. I visited when they were having a Hinamatsuri exhibition. Despite the relatively steep admission of 1,600 yen. It's not as well known as other exhibits in Tokyo - I was the only tourist visiting when I was there! While the exhibit is already over by now, I still recommend visiting Hyakudan Kaidan.

This ultimate Tokyo itinerary will help you plan your time throughout Japan's incredible city, giving you the very best experiences. Over the years I have had the pleasure of visiting Tokyo a handful of times. It's a vibrant and expansive city -- you could easily spend a few weeks here winding through the neighborhoods. From incredible dining and bustling coffee shops to amazing day trips, Tokyo offers a one-of-a-kind cosmopolitan experience. Tokyo may feel overwhelming to plan for. I remember my first trip trying to narrow down just exactly what to do. There is a lot to choose from but the best part is that you don't have to do it all. And I've narrowed down the very best highlights in a practical itinerary to follow. If you're traveling more in Japan, consider including this 5-days as part of a larger Two Week Itinerary in Japan. It's a wonderful start to any trip here. The fast-paced city is much more than city culture. You'll find traditional arts, green spaces, unique dining experiences, and much more. I hope this itinerary guide to visiting Tokyo will help you plan your dream trip. I'm food-focused, inspired by design, and live for local experiences -- so this itinerary is all of that and more.

The Ultimate Tokyo 5-Day Itinerary Tokyo Travel Tips Before You Arrive After my last two recent trips, I've narrowed down some do's and don'ts that you'll want to consider before you arrive in Tokyo. Give this a read to get a sense of what will help plan your Tokyo itinerary. Consider Booking Your Trip Over a Weekend Many of the places included below are best visited on the weekends. This itinerary can be done in any order, just be sure to confirm opening times as they may change seasonally. I've pulled together day itineraries here in pockets of Tokyo to cut down on travel time. Make Sure Your Google Maps Are Downloaded Offline One of the most helpful things you can do is to have your Google Maps downloaded offline for the Tokyo region. In addition to having Google Maps on your phone, there is a feature for offline maps that allows you to have the map accessible without data. Pre-Purchase Your JR Rail Pass Odds are you will want a JR Rail Pass for your trip if you plan to do any hopping around, like Tokyo to Kyoto. You have to apply and purchase your JR Rail Pass prior to arrival in Japan. While in Tokyo you can use this JR pass for the JR Lines only across the city and it is even good for the Narita Express Line which takes you from Narita Airport into Shibuya/Shinjuku area. To be eligible, you have to enter Japan as a temporary visitor (typical visa entry) and be sure to have the entry stamp on your passport. You purchase the JR Rail Pass prior to arriving in Japan, it is sent to your home, and then upon arrival, you go to a JR office (at most stations/airports) and exchange it for your pass. Read Transportation Tips for Japan for a more in-depth guide on getting around Japan. Get a Prepaid SIM Card Wi-Fi is your best friend in Tokyo and I highly recommend getting a Prepaid SIM Card before arrival. The last time I went, we had to do a more complicated SIM Card purchase at a 7/11 store, but now you can pre-purchase this highly reviewed data card on Amazon (which is what I'd do now). Where to Stay in Tokyo I highly recommend basing yourself in a single location for your time in Tokyo. Switching accommodations can be a headache with the trains, so picking a home base is helpful. I recommend being based in either Shinjuku or Shibuya. When you pick your accommodations, make sure there is a train station within 10 minutes of walking distance -- you'll use it a lot. Throughout my trips, I've stayed at: Best Location ($): JR-East Hotel Mets Shibuya Image via Booking. Com There is absolutely nothing fancy about this hotel. Hotel Mets is purely a logistic choice for accommodations and the location is one of the best. You're practically inside the Shibuya Train Station, making it very easy to explore Tokyo. The rooms are clean and simple, providing everything you need for a visit. Book the best rates here. Address: 3 Chome-29-17 Shibuya, Shibuya City, Tokyo 150-0002, Japan Best Location ($$): Shibuya Granbell Hotel Image via Booking. Com I have stayed twice at the Shibuya Granbell Hotel, one incredible location again inside the Shibuya Train Station. The rooms are a bit more elevated than the Hotel Mets but not by much. It's a great second option pending on which style you prefer. Book the best rates here. Address: 15-17 Sakuragaokacho, Shibuya City, Tokyo 150-0031, Japan Best Apartment Rental ($$): Designer Flat in Shibuya Image via Agoda. Com One of my favorite stays in Tokyo was this Designer Flat in Shibuya. Sleek, cement walls in a modern building, this was a great stay. It was a bit further from the train station however, we had a more \"neighborhood\" experience which I personally enjoyed. Book the best rates here. Other Shibuya Hotels to Consider TRUNK HOTEL, for an eco-chic stay Hotel Emit, for the best boutique hotel Mustard Hotel, for the best modern hotel Day 1: Yoyogi Park, Harajuku, & Omotesando/Aoyama Yoyogi Park & Area There is no better place to start your trip than Yoyogi Park. It is Tokyo's large green space and home to zen gardens and Shinto shrines. I find it really relaxing to stretch my legs out after a long travel day. Before entering the park, I'd stop into CAMELBACK Sandwich & Espresso for one of their creative sandwiches and grab a coffee to go. If they're not open yet, go to Coffee Supreme Tokyo around the corner. Stroll up into the park, and make your way to Meiji Jingu, the stunning Shinto Shrine. You can partake in the water purification ritual, where you ladle water from the fountain into your hands to wash your mouth. As you walk out of the Meiji Torii gates towards Harajuku, don't forget to stop by the picturesque Meiji Jingue Consecrated Sake Barrels. Harajuku Harajuku is a whirlwind of a neighborhood. It really doesn't come to life until after 10 am, but when it does, it gets jammed packed. The famous Takeshita Dori street runs right through it and you'll start to see the crowds line up for various food shops. Pop into one of the famous Japanese crepe stores while here for a Tokyo classic. For lunch, continue through the neighborhood to Sakura-tei Restaurant where you can make your own okonomiyaki. These savory Japanese pancakes are my absolute favorite, made of cabbage and your protein of choice, and it's so fun to make it yourself. (make reservations.) Omotesando + Aoyama Ometesando is arguably the most upscale neighborhood in Tokyo. This is where you'll find all of your high-end shopping, boutiques, cafe, and restaurants. You can continue into Omotesando right from Harajuku. Stop at Tokyu Plaza Omotesando Harajuku for the famous escalator that is built with geometric mirrors (such a trip). There are many stores in the neighborhood, like the famous AMORE Vintage for vintage luxury handbags. I love going into B-Side Label for all of the fun stickers you can collect. This whole neighborhood warrants 2-3 hours of just perusing. For caffeine needs, stop into the beautiful Blue bottle in Aoyama or Cafe Kitsune. To end the day, make your way to Nezu Museum in Aoyama (open Tues-Sunday, 10 am to 5 pm). This is my favorite museum in all of Tokyo -- the collection of pre-modern art and the gardens are wonderful. For dinner this night, pre-reserve the best tonkatsu meal in Tokyo at Butagumi. It's a life-changing meal, and well worth the price. Day 2: Nakameguro, Shimokitazawa, & Shibuya Nakameguro to Meguro In the morning, hop on the train to Naka-Meguro Station. You'll pop out and walk over to Onibus Coffee for one of the best cups of coffee in town, it's a peaceful start to the day. From there, make your way to the Meguro River which cuts through the scenic Meguro Neighborhood. If you time it right, you'll be treated to the best cherry blossom trees around. (Direction: Sakura Bridge.) This neighborhood is scenic and makes for just a good stroll and look around during the mid-morning to afternoon, I like to grab something quick at a 7/11 like Onigiri. Shimokitazawa I've included Shimokitazawa on this day as I find you'll go through Nakameguro and Meguro quite quickly and Shimokitazawa is almost always a bit out of the way to get to anyways. From Nakameguro, it is most convenient to go by car or consider the train which is 1 switch. Once in Shimokitazawa, I love how quaint and local this neighborhood feels. A few favorites from our past trips have been Bear Pond Espresso for coffee to start our time. Afterward, I love to stroll through the main shopping area called Shimokitazawa Ichibangai Shopping Street which is pedestrian-only (right out of the train station). And do make sure to stop into Fog Linen Work for the best home goods store around! Shibuya Late afternoon into evening, head to Shibuya for the bustle of Tokyo city life. It's so much fun to be here for sunset and into the evening as the lights come on and the city bursts with life. You'll want to see the famous Shibuya Scramble Crossing, where hundreds of people cross at the same time. If you're looking for a view, the newest observation deck to open in Tokyo is the Shibuya SKY Observation Deck, which could be worth adding to the itinerary if you have time. Shibuya is also known for shopping. My must-see store is always Shibuya Loft. For dinner, there are a few choices. The first is to stay right in the area and get soba noodles at Sagatani Shibuya Dogenzaka. You use a vending machine to purchase your meal choice (ask for help) and they make your noodles right there. It's in Dogenzaka which is a bustling neighborhood for ramen, gyoza, bars, and nightlife. If I were to pick, I would head up to FUKU Yakitori for the best meal (in my opinion) in Tokyo. It's a traditional yakitori-style meal that you'll need your accommodations to call in to reserve (trust me). I've eaten here about a half dozen times. I start and end every Japan trip with a meal here. Day 3: Tsukiji Fish Market, teamLab Planets, & Ramen Tsukiji Outer Market The early bird gets the worm here or in this case the best tuna. If you're looking to watch the tuna auctions, you need to go to the new Toyosu Market (I haven't been, really for only watching the auctions at 5 am). But if you're not doing that, the Tsukiji market is where it's at (train to Tsukiji Station). You'll stroll through the markets, shopping for various items from food to cookware. The thing to do here is to eat sushi for breakfast -- there are several famous stalls, but my favorite is Sushizanmai Main Branch. It's a bit hard to find but use Google Maps to find this dozen-seat sushi bar tucked inside for a set menu. If it's too busy, really most sushi stalls will be just fine. I'd allot 2 hours or so to peruse around here. Visit teamLab Planets One of my favorite things was visiting teamLab's exhibit and it's not terribly hard to get to from Tsukiji. The current exhibit open is teamLab Planets, and you'll need tickets to get in. As of now, the exhibit is set to be open through 2023, and try to avoid peak hours for a visit. Get tickets here. Late Ramen Lunch One of our favorite meals in Tokyo is to go for ramen. There are so many spots to choose from and we typically do this the same day as our morning at Tsukiji. You could head into Ginza which is close by to Tsukiji, and our favorite there is Hashigo Ginza Hon-Ten. It will put you in the Ginza neighborhood which is great for a stroll. If you're open to going further, Ramen Jiro Mita Honten has been a regular pilgrimage for us. Their hopping bowls of ramen topped with garlic in fatty pork broth are a favorite. The lines are always long, so make sure to get there at least an hour before closing. We've never found much to do afterward, but you could go up to Tokyo Tower afterward. Day 4: Shinjuku & Beyond Shinjuku There is so much to do in Shinjuku, one of the major hubs in Tokyo for business and dining. When you go is up to you, some like to start in the afternoon and stay through the night. One of my first stops is always Omoide Yokocho, a small alley with several izakaya stalls for food. Another thing to see in Shinjuku is to see the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, great for Sakura season as well. It has 144 acres of botanical gardens, so you could block out an hour or two here. Come nighttime, the action is all in Shinjuku's Golden Gai. Four blocks of narrow alleys are filled with bars, pubs, and taverns. It's a bit wild come night, so be mindful when you visit. Day 5: Take a Day Trip There are several wonderful day trips to consider from Tokyo which is quite easy as the trains are so well connected.

The city itself is home to more than 13 million people, and its metropolitan area houses more than 37 million. The area is 2,194 km squared, which is almost double the size of New York City. There's nothing else on earth like it. My husband and I have spent a collective 12 weeks in the city and are considering moving there, so have explored the dynamic metropolis extensively, uncovering its hidden gems and savoring its diverse culinary delights. In this comprehensive 5-day itinerary, I'll share my insights and recommendations to help you make the most of your visit. This is geared toward first-time visitors who have never seen the city, but there are many gems that even a Tokyo veteran would enjoy. If you're looking for what to book ahead of time in Tokyo, or where to stay, including neighborhoods and hotels, check out my other blog posts. 5-Day Tokyo Itinerary Overview Day 1: Shinjuku, Meiji Shrine, Harajuku, Shibuya Day 2: Ueno, Kitchen Street, Asakusa, Tokyo Skytree Day 3: Japanese Gardens, Imperial Palace, Ginza, Akihabara Day 4: Toyosu or Tsukiji Fish Market, Odaiba, Teamlabs Planets, Tokyo Tower Day 5: Option 1: Chic boutiques and cafes: Nakameguro, Daikanyama, and Ebisu Option 2: Upscale Art & Architecture: Aoyama, Omotesando, Azabudai Hills, Art Museums Option 3: Day trip to Hakone & Mt. Fuji Day 1: Shinjuku, Meiji Shrine, Harajuku, Shibuya 9am: Explore Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden Start your morning with a leisurely stroll through Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, enjoying the peaceful park, secluded from the bustle of the city. During cherry blossom season, this is one of the best places to see cherry blossoms in all of Tokyo. Shinjuku is primarily a night-time area, so be sure to make a trip back to see it at night. 11am: Meiji Shrine & Yoyogi Park Make your way from the garden to the Meiji Jingu, a Shinto shrine that hosts various cultural events and ceremonies, including traditional Shinto weddings, seasonal festivals, and performances of traditional music and dance. Almost every time we've visited we've seen something going on. From there, continue to walk south, through Yoyogi Park to Harajuku. 12pm: Harajuku Harajuku and Shibuya are possibly the two most crowded places in Tokyo, so prepare yourself. Enjoy lunch or afternoon tea in Harajuku, home to many of Tokyo's pet cafes. This area used to be full of men and women dressed in cosplay, anime characters, and maid outfits, but that edgy sub-culture has given way to a more commercial feel. Nevertheless, the famous (and crowded) Takeshita-Dori is lined with rainbow-colored, \"kawaii\" (Japanese for \"cute\") foods. Highlights include Le Shiner's Rainbow Cheese Sandwich, Totti Candy Factory's rainbow cotton candy, and Marion Crêpes' crepes, which are a staple of Harajuku street food culture. For a fun and flavorful exploration of Harajuku, I recommend this Crazy Cute & Kawaii Food Tour, which includes 5 distinct stops in the neighborhood. If bright-colored foods and animal cafes aren't your vibe, head over to Cat Street, a winding street half a mile long that is lined with clothing shops. If you're not in the mood to shop today, you can come back to it on Day 5, if you're in the Omotesando area again. From here, make your way south to Shibuya. 3pm: Shibuya If you're reading this far enough in advance, I'd highly recommend you get sunset time tickets for Shibuya Sky ( book on Klook), an open-air observation deck at approximately 230 meters above ground. A spot 1-2 hours before sunset will allow you to go up, explore a little, then see the city transform from daylight to golden hour to dusk to blue hour, and it's a truly magical transformation. If you take a lot of photos, I'd recommend you go 2 hours ahead. We entered around 4pm for a 6:10pm sunset and felt like the timing was perfect. If you just want to enjoy it, you can enter later, though those tickets might be even more difficult to book. Read more about what and how to book ahead of time. Before your entry, experience the world-famous Shibuya scramble crossing, where you're bound to see many cameras and GoPros capturing the sight of hundreds of people crossing over the zebra lines. Then make your way to the famous Hachiko statue, a symbol of unwavering loyalty and now a popular gathering point. This statue honors a dog who, in the 1920s, would journey to Shibuya Station to wait for his owner to arrive back from his daily commute. One day his owner did not return from work, having suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. But the faithful pup returned to the station just as before, to wait for his owner every day until his own death nearly 10 years later. Shibuya Stores worth visiting: Tower Records: This is one of the largest and most iconic music stores in the world, offering an extensive selection of vinyl records, CD's, DVD's, and music-related merch. The store often hosts live performances and events, and also has a cafe and bookstore for you to relax in. d47 Museum: The d47 Museum in Shibuya Hikarie showcases unique regional crafts, design, and culture from all 47 prefectures of Japan, offering an insightful glimpse into the nation's diverse heritage. The exhibits are thoughtfully curated, changing regularly to highlight different aspects of Japanese craftsmanship and innovation. Miyashita Park: This shopping and dining complex with a rooftop park offers plenty of unique restaurants, cafes, and stores. It's an ideal spot to experience Tokyo's innovative approach to urban redevelopment and lifestyle. Shibuya 109: Shibuya 109 is a famous shopping mall known for its cutting-edge fashion boutiques, catering to Tokyo's trendy youth culture and fashion-forward shoppers. The multi-story complex is a hotspot for discovering the latest in Japanese street fashion and pop culture. 6pm: Shinjuku For dinner, head back to where you started the day, Shinjuku, for some of the best photos of futuristic neon signs and nightlife. There are thousands of places to eat in Tokyo, and most of them are very good, with tiny hidden restaurants everywhere. Two very classically Japanese alleys in Shinjuku are Omoide Yokocho (Memory Lane), an alleyway near Shinjuku Station lined with small, traditional eateries and izakayas, and Golden Gai, which is similar to Omoide Yokocho but more bars than restaurants. Both are amazing to walk through, though, so I'd recommend you at least visit both. Shinjuku also has many of Tokyo's (and the world's) best bars. Shinjuku bars worth visiting: Bar Benfiddich: Owner and head bartender Hiroyasu Kayama is basically a scientist in his rustic, cozy, apothecary-like lab. They focus on handcrafted cocktails and herbal infusions, and are currently #37 on The World's Best Bars list. Art Bar Shuten-Doji: Art Bar Shuten-Doji offers cocktails inspired by Japanese folklore and mythology, with a focus on artistic presentation and unique flavor combinations. The ambiance is eclectic and vibrant, often featuring rotating art exhibitions and installations that add to the bar's dynamic atmosphere. [temporarily closed] New York Bar at the Park Hyatt: Famously known for its stunning panoramic views of Tokyo's skyline, this bar has live jazz performances and was made famous by the Hollywood movie, \"Lost in Translation.\" Unfortunately, it is undergoing renovations and closed, due to reopen in October 2025. If you want to make a whole night of it, here is a walking route of 9 bars in Shinjuku worth visiting. Day 2: Ueno, Kitchen Street, Asakusa, Tokyo Skytree 9am: Ueno Start your day at Ueno Park, a beautiful and expansive park with several museums and a zoo. Spend some time walking around the park, visiting the serene Shinobazu Pond, and optionally exploring Ueno Zoo if you're interested in seeing a variety of animals, including pandas. If you're interested in Japanese art and history, the Tokyo National Museum within Ueno Park is worth a visit. Allocate about an hour to explore its extensive collection of artifacts. 11am: Ameya-Yokocho (Ameyoko) Market Head to Ameya-Yokocho, a bustling market street near Ueno Station. Browse the various stalls selling everything from fresh seafood to clothing and souvenirs. This is a great place to sample classic Japanese street food like takoyaki (octopus balls), yakitori (grilled chicken skewers), or taiyaki (fish-shaped pastries filled with sweet red bean paste). 12:30pm: Kitchen Street Kappabashi is one of the most Japanese-esque shopping experiences you can have. Where else in the world can you find food turned into plastic displays for restaurants as you can here? 1:30pm: Asakusa After lunch, head to Asakusa and visit Senso-ji, Tokyo's oldest and most significant Buddhist temple. Enter through the iconic Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate) and stroll along Nakamise-dori, a shopping street leading up to the temple, where you can buy traditional snacks and souvenirs. For panoramic views of Asakusa and a quick stop for some cultural insights, visit Asakusa Culture and Tourist Information Center right across from the Kaminarimon gate. The observation deck offers great views of Senso-ji and Tokyo Skytree. For a quick dessert break, make your way to Chacha Futatsume for the Insta-famous matcha dessert. 4pm: Tokyo Skytree Make your way to Tokyo Skytree, the tallest structure in Japan. Visit the Tembo Deck and Tembo Galleria for breathtaking 360-degree views of Tokyo. Spend some time exploring the shops and attractions in the Tokyo Solamachi mall at the base of Skytree. If you have extra time, the Sumida Aquarium located in Tokyo Solamachi is a fascinating place to visit, featuring beautiful aquatic displays and a unique penguin exhibit. 6pm: Dinner in Asakusa Return to Asakusa for dinner. For a traditional Japanese dining experience, try Asakusa Imahan for delicious sukiyaki (thinly sliced beef cooked in a hot pot). Alternatively, if you prefer thick beef cutlets, Asakusa Gyukatsu is very well-rated beef katsu. 8pm: Evening Stroll After dinner, take a relaxing stroll along the Sumida River at Sumida Park, enjoying the beautiful night views of Tokyo Skytree illuminated against the night sky. For a more lively evening, head to Hoppy Street (Hoppy Dori) in Asakusa, where you can enjoy \"Hoppy drink,\" a beverage that tastes like beer, but with a lower alcohol content (around 0.8%). You can also find it here mixed with shochu or other spirits. The street is lined with izakayas, and it's a great time. Day 3: Japanese Gardens, Imperial Palace, Ginza, Akihabara 10am - 12pm: Imperial Palace & Gardens We've started every day in a large park, and today is no exception. The Imperial Palace and its surrounding gardens are some of the most beautiful and grand in Tokyo. If you want to enter the Imperial Palace, though, be sure to book tickets ahead of time. 12pm - 3pm: Ginza Ginza is Tokyo's answer to Fifth Avenue or Regent Street -- it's shopping shopping paradise. Many stores, including Muji and Uniqlo, have their flagships here, alongside many luxury labels, and stationary stores. Many of Tokyo's best sushi spots can also be found here, though there are also plenty of other restaurants and cafes that are perfect for an afternoon break. If you're interested in discovering local hidden bars and izakaya in the area, come back at 6pm for this tour. If you're into the arts, you can also check out Ginza's kabuki theater, a reconstruction of the original theater site (originally built in 1889) which stages regular kabuki drama performances. Shops in Ginza to Visit Itoya: Stationery paradise Ginza 6: great rooftop views Muji: Flagship Uniqlo: Flagship, but skip it if you're there in the afternoon as it will be crazy busy/crowded, and the fitting room lines are long and you can only try on 5 items at a time. 3pm - 6pm: Akihabara Also known as \"Electric Town,\" Akihabara is a vibrant district in Tokyo known for its bustling streets filled with electronics shops, anime and manga stores, and pop culture attractions. Originally famous for its abundance of electronics retailers, Akihabara has evolved into a cultural hub for otaku (geek) culture, attracting fans of anime, manga, video games, and idol groups from around the world. Anime and manga enthusiasts should definitely explore the Mandarake Complex, an eight-story building that specializes in anime, manga, and collectible toys, or Super Potato, a retro gaming paradise famous for its vast selection of retro video games, consoles, and merch, or Radio Kaikan, which sells electronics, hobby items, and anime merchandise. If those don't interest you, I'd recommend popping into Don Quijote, a popular discount chain store that is a scene unto itself, or Yodobashi Camera, one of the largest electronics stores in Japan, where you can find everything from cameras and computers, to household appliances, toys and games. If you have a driving license, book a Street Go-Karting experience, for which Akihabara is well known, although you can also do this in Shibuya, or Asakusa. For a slower end to the day, head to mAAch ecute or 2k540 Aki-Oka Artisan, two great shopping areas that offer a mix of independent boutiques, cafes, and a craft beer brewery. Sleep early tonight so you can have an early start the next day, to see the famous fish markets of Tokyo. Day 4: Toyosu or Tsukiji Fish Market, Odaiba, Teamlabs Planets, Tokyo Tower 5:30am Toyosu Fish Market Auction If you're interested in watching the famous Tuna Auction, it has moved from Tsukiji fish market to Toyosu. There are two ways to watch the auction (which starts at 5:30am). The first is through a lottery system (they changed the auction from being first-come-first-serve because the lines got absurdly long and started at 2am), which you can apply for here. The other is through a public observation deck that you can go to if you win the lottery, but is higher up and more crowded. For more, this blog post is a helpful guide. If you can, I would definitely recommend entering the lottery and trying to watch the auction. 7am Toyosu Once the auction finishes, you're free to wander around the site. There are lots of shops where chefs shop wasabi, dashi, and other produce that you are free to buy from, as well as restaurants that serve fresh seafood. If you want to see where the fish is sold, though, that part of the building is only accessible with a guide, so I'd recommend this Tuna Auction & Toyosu Market Tour, which will pick you up from your hotel, and then guide you through the auction and the market. If you don't care to see the auction or Toyosu, you can explore the Tsukiji Outer Market, instead. If you want to do both, I'd recommend this Toyosu & Tsukiji Market Tour and Sushi Workshop which begins with a walk around the fish markets, where you will purchase tuna, watch it cut into individual portions (a special job that even young sushi chefs are not allowed to do), then make sushi yourself. 9am Odaiba Once you've eaten yourself full of fresh fish, head over to Odaiba, a man-made island in Tokyo Bay that was originally built for defense, but rebuilt in the early 1990s to showcase futuristic living. Besides TeamLab Planets, which you should definitely visit (details below), here are some spots in Odaiba to enjoy: Odaiba Seaside Park (Odaiba Kaihin Koen): Enjoy a leisurely walk along the beach, rent a paddle boat, or simply relax and take in the views. The park is also an excellent spot for watching the sunset over the bay. The views here include Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo's own Statue of Liberty. DiverCity Tokyo Plaza: A large shopping and entertainment complex behind the enormous Unicorn Gundam statue. Inside, you'll find a range of stores from high-end brands to Japanese fashion, along with themed cafes and the Gundam Base Tokyo, dedicated to Gundam models and merchandise. Miraikan Museum (National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation): Miraikan is a museum that focuses on the latest advancements in science and technology, including hands-on exhibits related to space exploration, robotics, and environmental science. Panasonic Center Tokyo: This center features interactive exhibits on cutting-edge technology, sustainable living solutions, and the future of home electronics. It also hosts various events and workshops. If you're interested in seeing how this Japanese company is changing the game, this stop is for you. Fuji Broadcasting Center: This distinctive building has a spherical observation room on the 25th floor of Fuji's Headquarters. Inside the building, you can also visit television sets and a rooftop garden. Tokyo Joypolis: This gaming arcade features both traditional arcade games and some of the world's most advanced virtual reality games. 4pm TeamLab Planets I was worried before going that TeamLab Planets ( buy tickets) would be boring as its been Instagrammed to death, but it was quite the opposite. I loved the interactive art and would highly recommend anyone going to Tokyo to get tickets for this exhibit. If you can't get tickets for the first opening to get in before everyone else, I'd recommend going later in the evening and on a weekday. It gets pretty busy, but if you're patient enough, you can get photos without people in them. Video is a bit harder. If you've been to TeamLab Planets, you can go instead to TeamLab Borderless, which recently relocated to Azabudai Hills ( buy tickets). Day 5 5 days is barely enough to scratch the surface of Tokyo, but here are some options for your last day. If you're doing 7 days in Tokyo, I would make these days 5, 6, and 7. Option 1: Nakameguro, Daikanyama, and Ebisu Some of the cutest areas in Tokyo, these three neighborhoods are a little further Southwest and very trendy. 10am Nakameguro Start your morning at the Nakameguro Starbucks Reserve, which has floor to ceiling windows for 4 floors, and a huge open roasting operation. It opened in 2019 and is one of the biggest Starbucks in the world. They have all sorts of special merch, a matcha/tea corner, specialty drinks, and beautifully decorated walls. It does gets super busy, though, especially if you go during cherry blossom season, so be prepared to wait a bit for drinks and seating. After you've gotten your caffeine and maybe pastry fill, walk along the Meguro River, one of Japan's most famous cherry blossom spots. The cherry trees were cut this year so they didn't bloom as fully over the River, but it was still stunning to see them in full bloom. If you go during the cherry blossom season, though, brace yourself because it does get quite crowded. It might make more sense (if you go during this time) to go earlier and take photos of the blossoms first, then make your way to the Starbucks for a post-shoot snack. 2pm Daikanyama The Daikanyama area is where we originally considered moving to, and has many craft breweries and independent coffee roasteries. The streets there are lined with boutiques and cute shops, and there's really great vintage shopping in the area. The only reason we decided we probably would not move there is because it's a little far from the rest of Tokyo -- Nakameguro is slightly better connected. 5pm Ebisu In the evening, make your way to Ebisu, the most expat-friendly of the three areas. Many foreigners choose to live here, in a \"more suburban\" area of Tokyo, and the whole area is full of Japanese and Western cuisine. Option 2: Upscale Art & Architecture: Aoyama, Omotesando Azabudai Hills, Art Museums 10am: Aoyama Farmers Market On Saturdays and Sundays, there is a farmers market at UNU (United Nations University), and itis one of Tokyo's longest running and best-attended markets. Organic and local fare is readily available from 10am to 4pm, and the stalls change periodically. We went twice in the span of 3 weeks and saw a 30-50% change in the stalls. I would recommend eating a small brunch here, at one of the food trucks, or in the various cafes nearby, notably Pierre Hermé or Gotran Cherrier. 11am: Nezu Museum From there, make your way to Nezu Museum, where you can explore the musem's impressive collection of East Asian art and the beautiful Japanese garden. The architecture by Kengo Kuma is also a highlight. This is also the start of a street with high-end boutiques and sophisticated architecture. 12:30pm: Aoyama If you're hungry after the museum, a great lunch option nearby is Aoyama Flower Market Tea House, where you can enjoy tea and a meal in a green house, surrounded by flowers. Otherwise, follow the large street from Nezu Museum toward Omotesando, and you will hit many shopping and architecutre highlights including Gentle Monster, Comme des Garçons, and Prada. If you're just taking photos, the street will probably take about 30 minutes to walk. If you're shopping, I'd allocate more time. 2pm: Omotesando Hills Spend an hour and a half exploring this architectural gem designed by Tadao Ando. Enjoy some high-end shopping, admire the sleek interior design, and perhaps grab a coffee at one of the chic cafes. I love how Tokyo has all these amazing buildings built on very strange lots of land. Then, if you have more time and interest, you can also briefly visit the Watari Art Museum, a contemporary art museum designed by Mario Botta, which is not too far away. 4pm: Azabudai Hills Head over to this new development area which features stunning modern architecture and design. Spend around 2 hours exploring the upscale shops, eateries, and public spaces. Enjoy the unique blend of greenery and urban design. This is also where the new Aman sister property, Janu, is located. 6pm: Roppongi Every day but Tuesday, Mori Art museum is open until 10pm, and has an amazing, rotating exhibition of international contemporary work. Don't miss the Tokyo City View observation deck for stunning views of the city at sunset and nightfall. Choose from a variety of upscale dining options in Roppongi Hills or nearby, such as L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (French) or Ukai-tei Roppongi (teppanyaki). 9pm: Visit a Bar If you have energy left, take a leisurely stroll around the Roppongi area to enjoy the nightlife and illuminated cityscape. Alternatively, visit a bar in the area, like Ayano's Bar, Mogambo Tokyo, or Bar as ONE Roppongi. Option 3: Day trip to Hakone & Mt. Fuji The easiest way to do this day trip is on a tour, with a guide to tell you all about what you're seeing. This extremely well-rated tour is a great option -- they take you to the 5th Station of Mt. Fuji by deluxe coach, then you enjoy a Japanese Garden, lunch buffet, and Owakudani Valley, before riding a sky gondola and a Lake Ashi cruise. All of this with an English-speaking guide and bullet train return to Tokyo. You can also do it on a 10-hour Private Tour, which I personally prefer. Another optional day trip is a visit to Yokohama, where you can see Minato Mirai 21, a futuristic waterfront area featuring the Landmark Tower with its Sky Garden observation deck for panoramic city views, visit the Cup Noodles Museum, where you can create your custom cup of noodles and learn about the history of this iconic food (book ahead), and explore Yokohama Chinatown, the largest in Japan. There's also Sankeien Garden, Yamashita Park, and Yokohama Museum of Art. This day trip is easier to do on your own, but if you'd rather do a tour, you can take a train to Yokohama and then join this private 8hr tour.

It's fast-paced, futuristic, and bursting with weird and wonderful activities to keep you busy, including gorgeous shrines, palaces, and temples; hip clubs and bars; and fashionable people and shopping, not to mention beautiful cherry blossoms. Tokyo lives up to all the hype. If I could spend months living there, I would. You never know what you'll find here. One second you'll run into a group of women dressed in pig masks and '80s dresses and the next you're in a robot café or a centuries-old temple. It's also one of the biggest cities in the world, home to almost 14 million people (almost 40 million if you count the metropolitan area). Not surprisingly, there are many nooks and crannies to explore in this city that seamlessly weave centuries-old Japanese traditions with modern technology. (So don't rush your visit. You're never going to see it all anyway, so don't try!) To help you plan your trip, here is my suggested itinerary based on over seven visits to Tokyo: Tokyo Itinerary Highlights Day 1: Fish Market, Imperial Palace, Harajuku, & more! Day 2: Asakusa, Ueno Park, Sento, & more! Day 3: Shinjuku, Shibuya, Quirky Cafes, & more! Day 4: Take a Day Trip Day 5: Sumo, Samurai, Meguro River, & more! Tokyo Itinerary: Day 1 ( Note: There's a lot listed for this day. Since you're likely to wake up super early because of jet lag, you can fit it all in. You might not want to, though. Maybe you need an afternoon nap!) Roam the Tsukiji and Toyosu Fish Markets In 2018, Tokyo's main fish market moved to Toyosu, which is twice the size of the old one, Tsukiji, making it the largest in the world. While a lot of good restaurants moved too (Sushi Dai being the most famous), I find the place itself very stale, since you can no longer wander the floor (you look down via a walkway above; you also need a visitor's pass to enter). The old outer market in Tsukiji is still great though, and you can still find food and stores there too. You can wander alone and just eat and shop until you can't anymore! Most businesses open at 6am, so it's a perfect place to go in the morning when you wake up early because of jet lag. Food and drink tours of the Tsukiji Outer Market are available for around 13,500 JPY. Tsukiji Fish Market: 5 Chome-2-1 Tsukiji, Chuo, +81 3-3542-1111. Admission is free. Toyosu Fish Market: 6 Chome-6-2 Toyosu, Koto, +81 3-3520-8205. Open Monday-Saturday 5am-5pm, though most businesses don't open until 7am. Admission is free. Immerse yourself at teamLab Planets This really fun and quirky digital art installation is a multisensory and immersive experience in which you become part of the artwork, walking barefoot through the four exhibition spaces and gardens as you interact with the installations. It takes an hour or so to go through. teamLab is quite popular and generally sells out at least a few days in advance, so I recommend getting your tickets online ahead of time. 6 Chome-1-16 Toyosu, Koto City, teamlab. Art/e/planets. Open Monday-Sunday 9am-10pm; last entry is one hour before closing. Admission is 3,800 JPY for adults during weekdays and 4,200 JPY on weekends. Discounts are available for children and those with disabilities. Admire the Imperial Palace When the emperor moved from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869, he took Edo for his new residence and renamed it Tokyo. Though you can't go inside (or get very close), the building is amazing. It is surrounded by lovely grounds and a park, and there's a moat around the stone walls. You can also see the changing of the guard, though it's a relatively low-key and unassuming ceremony. Tokyo Localized offers a free walking tour of the gardens that is worth taking and lasts 2.5 hours. Admission to the grounds is free. Feast below the Girders Not far from the palace is the Yurakucho neighborhood. Below the elevated train tracks at Yurakucho Station is a 700-meter stretch of wine bars, beer pubs, and casual restaurants filled with businessmen. It's a good spot for lunch, though it gets the most busy after work, when people stop in for food and happy hour on their way home. Scale the Tokyo Tower Built in 1957 and resembling the Eiffel Tower, the Tokyo Tower is taller (at 333 meters/1,092 feet) than its European version and made entirely of steel. It was the city's tallest structure until the \"Skytree\" was built in 2010. You can pay to go all the way to the top floor to take in the view, but frankly, the main observation deck offers one that's just as good. 4 Chome-2-8 Shibakoen, Minato, +81 3-3433-5111, tokyotower. Co.jp. Open daily 9am-11pm. Admission is 1,200 JPY. Relax at Meiji Jingu Located at the northern end of Yoyogi Park, Meiji Jingu is a peaceful Shinto shrine honoring Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken, who helped modernize Japan. It's nestled in a serene forest, with a big wooden gate marking the entrance and paths lined with trees. You really don't feel like you're in one of the busiest, most densely populated cities in the world when you wander around here. Watch traditional ceremonies, stroll through the gardens, or check out the museum. (FYI: It gets really busy on the weekends.) 1-1 Yoyogikamizonocho, Shibuya City, +81 3-3379-5511, meijijingu.or.jp. Open every day of the year from sunrise to sunset. Admission is free. Enjoy Yoyogi Park One of Tokyo's largest parks, Yoyogi is laced with walking paths, forested areas, and ponds. It is also used for music events and festivals throughout the year, and you'll see many street performers and shops selling snacks. If you're visiting in late March or early April, you'll be able to catch the cherry blossoms. In the fall, the ginkgo forest takes on a beautiful golden color. 2-1 Yoyogikamizonocho, Shibuya City, +81 3-3469-6081, tokyo-park.or.jp/park/yoyogi. Open 24 hours, though some facilities have shorter opening times. Admission is free. Get trendy in Harajuku Harajuku is one of the most iconic districts in Tokyo. It's renowned for its avant-garde take on fashion, it's the epicenter of anime and kawaii (cuteness) culture in Tokyo, with lots of quirky and vintage-clothing stores and street art. Walking around the area, you'll see all kinds of outfits, mostly worn by younger Japanese people (predominantly teenagers), making it a fun place to people-watch and window-shop. If you want to go shopping, this is one of the best areas to do it in. you'll find a lot of the best Japanese designers here. Dine with ninjas For a unique dining experience, head to Ninja Tokyo (formerly Ninja Akasaka), a ninja-themed restaurant designed like an Edo-era building, with wait staff clothed in stereotypical all-black garb and trained in all sorts of tricks and illusions. You'll order off old scrolls while being entertained by the skills of your server! It's super fun. Tokyu Plaza Akasaka, +81 3-5157-3936, ninja-tokyo.jp. Open daily 5pm-10pm, plus 11:30am-2pm on weekends. Drink in Golden Gai This district, lined with backstreet bars, may be touristy, but it's one of the most fun in Tokyo. These zigzag alleys are filled with hole-in-the-wall bars serving cheap drinks. Each is unique, so it's fun to pop in and out of them. It's very touristy, but you'll find a lot of Japanese people here too. It's quite crowded on the weekends, so go early before the bars fill up. If you want a deep dive into the area, take a food tour. Arigato Tours runs an evening tour around Golden Gai and Omoide Yokocho in Shinjuku that will show you around and let you sample the best ramen and yakitori in the area. Tokyo Itinerary: Day 2 Check out Asakusa If you want to see some of Tokyo's historic religious sites, spend some time wandering around Asakusa. Just start as early as you can to avoid the crowds (especially if you plan on taking photos). These are two places not to be missed: Senso-ji - Tokyo's most popular and famous temple is beautifully painted and sits in a scenic spot near a pagoda and the impressive Kaminari Gate. There's a huge statue of Kannon, the goddess of mercy, inside the main hall. 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa, Taito, +81 3-3842-0181, senso-ji.jp. The grounds are open 24/7, though the temple itself is open daily 6am-5pm. Admission is free. Asakusa Shrine - Not far from Senso-ji is this Shinto shrine, built during the Edo period and which survived the air raids of World War II. This is much more peaceful than Senso-ji, with fewer people, whom you'll be able to see praying, meditating, or performing traditional rituals. 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa, Taito, +81 3-3844-1575, asakusajinja.jp. Open daily 9am-4:30pm. Admission is free. Explore Ueno Park Spanning over 133 acres, Ueno Park is a lovely spot to spend the day. Various stalls and vendors sell snacks, drinks, and souvenirs. On weekends, there are usually cultural events or festivals showcasing traditional arts, music, and dance. During cherry blossom season, the park is full of people picnicking and admiring the thousands of trees. The park is also home to some of Tokyo's best museums: Tokyo National Museum -Established in 1872, this massive museum in the north end of the park houses one of the world's largest collections of art and artifacts from Asia, particularly Japan. 13-9 Uenokoen, Taito, +81 3-3822-1111, tnm.jp. Open daily 9:30am-5pm (7pm on Fridays and Saturdays). Admission is 1,000 JPY. Tosho-gu Shrine - This beautiful 17th-century Shinto shrine with carved gold doors and ornate carvings can also be found in the park. 9-88 Uenokoen, Taito, +81 3-3822-3455, uenotoshogu. Com/en. Open daily 9am-5:30pm (4:30pm in winter). Admission is free up to the wall, though to go further inside is 500 JPY. To enter the shrine and peony garden costs 1,600 JPY. There's also a combo ticket for the shrine and treasure hall for 2,100 JPY. National Museum of Nature and Science - Opened in 1871, this museum houses exhibitions on pre-Meiji science. There are over 5,000,000 items in the collection, with 14,000 of them on permanent display. It's also home to the taxidermied body of the legendary dog Hachiko, the loyal dog who would greet his owner at Shibuya Station on return from his daily commute (more on him later). 7-20 Uenokoen, +81 50-5541-8600, kahaku. Go.jp. Open Tuesday-Sunday 9am-5pm. Admission is 630 JPY. National Museum of Western Art - This is one of the only museums in the country to focus on Western art, established in 1959. The collection of almost 5,000 pieces extends from the Renaissance all the way to the 20th century. Expect to see works by masters like Van Gogh, Reubens, Renoir, Monet, Picasso, and many more! 7-7 Uenokoen, +81 3-3828-5131, nmwa. Go.jp. Open Tuesday-Sunday 9:30am-5:30pm (8pm on Fridays and Saturdays). Admission is 500 JPY. Browse Akihabara Akihabara, or \"Akiba,\" is a bustling district in central Tokyo known for its vibrant electronics, anime, manga, and gaming culture. You'll find streets full of gadgets, anime merchandise, card games, and collectibles. Stop and play in one of the plethora of video game shops. This area is also where you'll find the famous maid cafés, where servers dress up as maids and serve you food and drinks. The girls on the street are promoting the more hole-in-the-wall options, which are a lot more culturally fun than the big touristy ones. (They aren't cheap, though, as you have to buy drinks packages and pay a fee, but it's kitschy and fun.) Bathe in a sento A sento is a traditional public bathhouse, typically separated by gender. The Japanese are not shy, so you'll need to be comfortable with nudity! A budget-friendly sento will cost you under 1,000 JPY. Just note that tattoos can be frowned upon and you might be required to cover them up. Go go-karting Want to speed around the streets of Tokyo in a go-kart while wearing a costume? The Monkey Kart company lets you. As long as you have an international driving permit (which you can get if you have a valid driver's license), you can take part. They'll snap photos of you in the act too! You can book the experience here. Shibuya, 1F, 1 Chome-27-7, +81 3-5309-2639, monkey-kart. Com. Open daily 9:30am-9pm. The course will take 75 minutes and costs 16,000 JPY per person. There are multiple locations around the city. Tokyo Itinerary: Day 3 Stroll through Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden This gorgeous park is over 144 acres and home to some 20,000 trees. Most of the original park was destroyed in World War II during the air raids, but it was rebuilt and reopened in 1949. During spring, it's one of the best spaces to see cherry blossoms. I love the traditional landscape garden, which has several ponds with bridges and islands. It's a peaceful little oasis within the hustle and bustle. 11 Naitomachi, Shinjuku, +81 3-3350-0151, env. Go.jp/garden/shinjukugyoen/index. Html. Open Tuesday-Sunday 9am-5:30pm. Generally, advance ticket purchase is required, but note that during cherry blossom season, you can't book tickets in advance. Admission is 500 JPY. See Shibuya Crossing This is quite possibly the busiest and most famous intersection in the world (some 2,500 people cross the street here every two minutes). The area is buzzing at night, with bright lights and frenzied activity -- like Times Square on steroids. Make sure to visit the dog statue between Shibuya Station and the intersection (at the Hachiko Exit) -- it's a tribute to Hachiko, the loyal dog who would greet his owner at Shibuya Station on return from his daily commute. This continued until the owner passed away at work in 1925. Hachiko then visited the station daily and waited for his owner until he also passed away nearly a decade later, in 1935. Experience a tea ceremony No visit to Japan is complete without experiencing a traditional tea ceremony. While these are usually long and expensive experiences, there are definitely some budget-friendly options for anyone looking not to break the bank. True Japan runs ceremonies in Tokyo for 9,900 JPY per person; they last 75 minutes. Sakurai Japanese Tea Experience is another good option, located near Shibuya. Visit a quirky café Tokyo has all sorts of amazing, weird, and wonderful cafés: monster cafés, owl cafés, cat cafés, vampire cafés, dog cafés, religious-themed cafés, and much more! If you're looking for something unusual to do, see what weird and quirky cafés are near you (they're all around town, so you never have to go far to find one!). Here are some suggestions: Kawaii Monster Café Vampire Café Christon Café (Christian themed) Dog Heart (dog café) Mipig Cafe Harajuku (pig café) Calico (cat café) Harry (hedgehog café) Ninja Cafe & Bar (ninja themed) Enjoy traditional Japanese theater Kabuki is a traditional form of theater involving dance and drama. The costumes and makeup are heavily stylized, making for a very visual performance. The Kabuki-za, located in Ginza, is the best venue in which to see one of these incredible displays. Just keep in mind that performances are in Japanese. 4 Chome-12-15 Ginza, +81 3-3545-6800, kabuki-za. Co.jp. Performances are held almost daily. Check the website for the most up-to-date schedule. Expect to pay at least 4,000 JPY if you book in advance. You can often arrive the day of and get last-minute tickets for cheaper, however. Tokyo Itinerary: Day 4 Time to take a break and head out on a day trip for some non-urban adventures. Here are some suggestions: See Daibutsu (the Great Buddha) Make a day trip to Kamakura, where you can see a 13-meter (42-foot) bronze statue of Buddha. It was initially built in 1252 within a temple, but the structure was washed away -- on several occasions -- by storms. The statue now sits in the open air, (along with a massive pair of straw sandals that belong to the statue). You can even go inside the statue itself -- there isn't much to see, but it's still kind of neat to be able to step into a massive statue of that size and importance. The journey to Kamakura takes around an hour and is free with a Japan Rail Pass. 4 Chome-2-28 Hase, Kamakura, +81 467-22-0703, kotoku-in.jp. Open daily 8am-5:30pm (until 5pm during the winter). Admission is 300 JPY. Get touristy at Tokyo Disneyland I'm a sucker for Disney attractions! This is a fun choice for anyone traveling with children, but also for adults who just love amusement parks. Opened in 1983, it has seven themed areas to explore and is the third most visited theme park in the world (18 million each year). It has a lot of the same famous rides you'll find at Disney World, such as Splash Mountain, the Haunted Mansion, and the nauseating Mad Tea Cup Ride. It's best to book online in advance. 1-1 Maihama, Urayasu, +81 45-330-5211, tokyodisneyresort.jp/tdl. Open daily 8am-10pm. Admission is 7,900-10,900 JPY for adults and 6,600-9,000 JPY for children, depending on age. Hike Mount Mitake Located just over an hour from Tokyo is Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park, covering 1,250 square kilometers of rolling hills, mountains, and forests. There are plenty of hiking trails, though you can also take a cable car to the top and then hike to the shrine that sits on the peak, some 930 meters (3,050 feet) above sea level. It's a 30-minute walk to the shrine from the peak or top of the cable car. From there, you can hike for an hour to a small valley with two picturesque waterfalls or continue on to Mount Otake, which is about two hours from the summit of Mount Mitake. Behold Mount Fuji Located just over an hour from Tokyo and standing at an impressive 3,776 meters (12,389 feet), Mount Fuji is one of the most iconic views in the country. It is also an active stratovolcano (it last erupted in 1708) and one of the Three Holy Mountains of Japan. Covered in snow for almost half of the year, it is both a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and a UNESCO Cultural Site. In the summer, the mountain is open to hikers, who spend anywhere from 5 to 12 hours reaching the summit. Traditionally, hikers depart at night to arrive at the top for the sunrise. If you don't want to hike to the peak, you can simply visit on a day trip. There are buses that can take you partway up, from which you'll be offered sweeping vistas of the surrounding area. Guided day tours from the city cost around 12,000 JPY. Visit the Ghibli Museum If you're a fan of famed director Hayao Miyazaki's work (which includes films like Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, and Princess Mononoke), then you'll want to check out this amazing exhibition. Designed by Miyazaki himself, it is an immersive experience that any film buff will appreciate. There is also a new short film every month, only available to visitors. The museum won't take up a whole day, but it's not in a very central location, so you'll need to plan accordingly. 1 Chome-1-83 Shimorenjaku, +81 570-055-777, ghibli-museum.jp. Open Wednesday-Monday 10am-6pm. Admission is 1,000 JPY for adults, with discounts available for youth and children. There are limited tickets available each day, so book in advance. Tokyo Itinerary: Day 5 During your last day in Tokyo, the city is your oyster. There's still plenty to do. Go shopping, explore new cafés, wander gardens, eat all the food -- the possibilities are endless. Some other things I love to do include the following: Admire the National Art Center Opened in 2007, this museum and gallery doesn't actually have a permanent collection but rather houses a never-ending series of temporary exhibitions, from impressionism to modern art. Check the website to see what is currently being shown. 7 Chome-22-2 Roppongi, +81 3-5777-8600, nact.jp. Open Wednesday-Monday 10am-6pm and Fridays and Saturdays until 8pm. Admission varies by exhibit. Visit the Samurai Museum No trip to Japan would be complete without learning about samurai. While they were known for their martial skill, there was much more to the culture than just mastering the katana (a traditional sword). The museum has some incredible displays of traditional weapons and armor, some of which you can even try on. Kabukicho 2-25-6, +81 3-6457-6411, samuraimuseum.jp/en. Open daily 10:30am-9pm. Admission is 1,900 JPY. You can explore the museum on your own or in a group tour, which is conducted every 30 minutes. Still temporarily closed due to COVID; check the website for updates. Watch a sumo match Kokugikan, Japan's most famous sumo arena, hosts tournaments three times each year. The wrestling that we see today dates to the 17th century, though its origins go back even further, and it's still one of the most popular traditions in the country. If you're in town at the right time, this is a must-do! Tickets sell out quickly, so act fast. You can book a ticket online here (you'll be accompanied by a guide too, so you can learn more about the tradition as it unfolds before your eyes). 1 Chome-3-2-8 Yokoami, Sumida, +81 3-3623-5111, sumo.or.jp/kokugikan. Ticket prices vary, but expect to pay around 3,800 JPY. Have drinks at the Park Hyatt New York Bar is the iconic bar from Sofia Coppola's 2003 film Lost in Translation. Located on the 52nd floor, it actually lives up to the hype. The atmosphere is classy, the drinks are great, and the view is absolutely stunning. There is live jazz every night, and while there is a cover charge (around 2,750 JPY), it's definitely worth it! 3-7-1-2 Nishishinjuku, +81 3-5322-1234, hyatt. Com. Open Sunday-Wednesday 5pm-12am and Thursday-Saturday 5pm-1am. Peruse the Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum Built in 1933, this small museum used to be the official residence of Prince and Princess Asaka. The prince had studied in Paris and wanted to bring Art Deco to Japan, which explains the building's style and decorations. In 1983, the residence became a museum and is now home to a rotating series of modern art exhibitions. 5-21-9 Shirokanedai, +81 3-3443-0201, teien-art-museum.ne.jp/en. Open daily 10am-6pm. Garden admission is 200 JPY; museum admission varies depending on the current exhibition. Promenade along the Meguro River The Meguro River weaves almost 8 kilometers (5 miles) through Tokyo and makes for a magnificent stroll. There's a path with a bit of green space that follows the water, so plenty of locals walk or exercise there. In the spring, you'll be able to see a lot of cherry blossoms too. There's also plenty of restaurants along the way to stop and eat at! Take the Harry Potter studio tour If you love Harry Potter, this studio tour is a must. Like the original in London, \"The Making of Harry Potter\" lets you walk in his footsteps and explore his amazing wizarding world. You can wander iconic sets like the Great Hall and Diagon Alley, see original props and costumes from the films, and learn how they were made. There are also sections on the newer Fantastic Beasts films. It takes about 3 hours to see it all. Just make sure to book the earliest spot in the day, as the crowds here can be huge later on. I posted more tips on Instagram if you want to learn more. 1 Chome-1-7 Kasugacho, +81 50-6862-3676, wbstudiotour.jp. Open daily 8:30am-10pm. Tickets at 6,500 JPY.

Just hearing the name conjures up images of densely packed skyscrapers, streets lined with larger-than-life advertisements and crowded public spaces. Shibuya Crossing Yes, that vision is correct, but as we discovered during our 4 days in Tokyo, there is much more to the city than first meets the eye. Tokyo is a city where the past, present and innovations for the future co-exist in perfect harmony. Near the Imperial Palace It's a megacity with something for everyone- an intriguing pop culture, modern architecture, traditional temples and shrines, large parks, quiet gardens, informative museums, high-end shopping, a thriving nightlife and endless opportunities for people watching. To best experience Tokyo, a multi-day visit is required. I recommend spending at least 4 days in Tokyo to be able to explore numerous districts, plus have time for a day trip outside the city. Street in Asakusa, near Sensoji Temple. How to Spend 4 Days in Tokyo- Planning Your Visit During our 4 days in Tokyo, we immersed ourselves in the hustle and bustle, reflected at temples and shrines, took walks in the parks and admired the city from above. Admittedly, we arrived to Tokyo without much of a plan, not sure what we wanted to see and do. Therefore, our visit was not as efficient as it could have been. We spent a lot of time crisscrossing the city on the subway. Some days I felt like that's all we were doing! Tokyo is so big that you should treat it like multiple separate cities (which it sort of is, being made up of 23 special wards). Dividing your visit into zones will make sightseeing more manageable, minimize time spent riding the subway, and make Tokyo seem less overwhelming. Tokyo Tower 4 Day Tokyo Itinerary- Things to See and Do in Tokyo I've been to Tokyo twice, so the following itinerary contains places I visited on both of my trips. However, I believe we could have seen this all on our original 4 day visit to Tokyo had we been more organized. On our first trip we inexplicably missed out on Meiji Shrine, even though we were right across the street from it (a big regret, so it was the first place I went on my return visit). The Edo-Tokyo museum is the other addition. Here's a look at how we chose to spend our 4 days in Tokyo, all conveniently organized into zones- Western Tokyo, Central Tokyo, Northern Tokyo- plus a day trip that is not to be missed! We hope this Tokyo itinerary helps you plan your own 4 day trip to Tokyo! Note: Links will open in a new window for your convenience Day 1: Western Tokyo Neighbourhoods visited: Shibuya, Harajuku, Yoyogi, Shinjuku Shibuya To start our visit to Tokyo, we jumped right in and set out to experience the modern, bustling side of the city by visiting Shibuya, one of the busiest neighbourhoods in Tokyo. During the day Shibuya is a trendy shopping area, at night a lively entertainment district. Arriving at Shibuya Station was quite overwhelming as it's the fourth busiest train station in Japan, handling about 2.4 million passengers on an average weekday. We managed not to get lost and found our way to the Hachiko exit, which is what you want for a memorable first impression of Shibuya. Exiting at Hachiko Square, we were greeted by flashing video screens, bright neon signs, and the famous Shibuya Crossing. Shibuya Crossing is rumoured to be the world's busiest intersection and was quite the spectacle, even on a Sunday. Snagging a window seat at the Starbucks across from the station, we had a prime position to watch the infamous \"Scramble\". When the traffic lights turn red, people come from all directions to hurriedly cross the street. You'd think it would be chaos, with people walking into each other, but it looked almost like a choreographed dance. The Shibuya Scramble is definitely one of the best people watching experiences in Tokyo! Check hotel prices and availability in Shibuya Harajuku Moving on to Harajuku, Tokyo's fashion district, we hoped to see some of the outrageous fashions of teenage Harajuku culture. Walking up the narrow alley of Takeshita-dori, we saw shops selling unique clothes and places serving crepes, but mostly it was just shoulder-to-shoulder people. We didn't even see any Harajuku girls. While Takeshita-dori was fun to see, it wasn't somewhere I wanted to spend a lot of time (too many people!) Luckily, at the end of the street I could retreat into the forested grounds of Meiji Shrine. Meiji-jingu (Meiji Shrine) Meiji Shrine is one of my favourite places in Tokyo and an absolute pleasure to visit in the early morning hours, when very few people are around. Nestled within a sprawling forest of about 100,000 trees, Meiji Shrine is the perfect place to go when you tire of Tokyo's modern skyscrapers. Here you can enjoy a relaxing stroll in the shade, connect with nature and experience the traditional side of Japanese culture. Meiji Shrine is dedicated to Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken, making it Tokyo's most important Shinto shrine. Read my full post about Meiji Shrine. Tokyo Metropolitan Government Offices- West Shinjuku West Shinjuku is not that interesting because it's mainly office towers, but those towers offer fantastic views of Tokyo. For a view with a price that can't be beat (it's free!), we headed up to the 45 th floor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building. The twin, 202m high towers each have an indoor observatory where you can overlook the city. On a clear day you can apparently catch a glimpse of Mt. Fuji, but I never saw it on either of my two visits to the observatory at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building. East Shinjuku East Shinjuku is fun to visit at night when the neon signs cast a glow over the skyscraper-lined streets. This part of Shinjuku can be thought of as Tokyo's playground. A centre for nightlife, there are bars, movie theatres, pachinko parlours and restaurants. If you visit during the day, you'll be able to browse department stores and perhaps even catch a glimpse of Godzilla fiercely peering over the Shinjuku Toho building and Hotel Gracery. If you're a true Godzilla fan, you'll want to go inside the hotel lobby to see the display of Godzilla movie posters throughout the years. Also, if you happen to be there at the top of the hour (from noon-8:00 pm), you'll witness Godzilla roaring and breathing steam. The giant Godzilla head can be found at 1-19-1 Kabukicho and is a 5 minute walk from the east exit of JR Shinjuku Station. Check hotel prices and availability in Shinjuku Day 2: Central Tokyo and Tokyo Bay Neighbourhoods visited: Shibakoen,Marunouchi, Odaiba Tokyo Tower We started our second day in Tokyo by heading to Shiba Park to visit Tokyo Tower. Tokyo Tower is modelled after the Eiffel Tower in Paris, but is taller and, in our opinion, not as elegant. We thought it looked less like a work of art and more like a functional broadcast tower (which it is). Still, Tokyo Tower was worth visiting because of the two viewpoints overlooking the city- one at 150 metres and the other at 250 metres. We went up to both viewing levels (the top one has the best views) and got a good sense at just how big Tokyo is. The city was sprawled out as far as we could see! Tokyo Imperial Palace Next we made our way to the Imperial Palace, which is where the Emperor and his family live. I knew the palace wasn't open to the public, but was surprised to find out that the East Garden of the Imperial Palace was closed as well (it was a Monday. The garden is also closed on Fridays). Disappointed, we instead walked around the perimeter of the grounds. It actually was quite nice to stroll alongside the moats and stone walls. Soon we came to the Nijubashi, a double-arched stone bridge that serves as the entrance to the inner palace grounds. From the bridge, you can even catch a glimpse of the Imperial Palace. Update: I've since been back to Tokyo and was able to visit the Imperial Palace East Gardens. The highlight was the Ninomaru Japanese garden- so beautiful! Tokyo International Forum While not a major tourist attraction, the Tokyo International Forum is worth visiting if you appreciate architecture. The ceiling of the glass atrium resembles a ship's hull, making it one of Tokyo's most distinctive buildings. Check hotel prices and availability in Central Tokyo Odaiba & Tokyo Bay As evening approached, we made our way across Tokyo Bay to the island of Odaiba (Daiba). To get there, we took a surprisingly fun ride on the driverless Yurikamome monorail. Sitting in the front seat, we got fantastic views of the city's night lights as the train looped above the harbour then crossed Rainbow Bridge. I felt like we were riding into a theme park! We spent most of our time in Odaiba along the waterfront, going for walks and enjoying a meal at as we gazed across the bay. There is a small replica of the Statue of Liberty here but I was most enamored with Rainbow Bridge and its backdrop of city lights. Tokyo sure is beautiful at night, especially when viewed from Odaiba! We wish we arrived to Odaiba earlier in the day because we really liked the feel of this area of Tokyo. Next time, I want to ride the Ferris wheel at Palette Town and get some pictures of the futuristic-looking Fuji TV building. Update: Palette Town is undergoing a major redevelopment starting in 2022, so many of its attractions will be closing, including the Ferris wheel. Check hotel prices and availability in Odaiba Day 3- Northern Tokyo Neighbourhoods visited: Ryogoku, Ueno, Asakusa, Oshiage Edo-Tokyo Museum Normally I don't like to visit museums on my travels, but the Edo-Tokyo Museum was one I'm glad I decided to explore. The Edo-Tokyo Museum captured my imagination with its scale-model dioramas, automated exhibits, miniature townspeople figurines and large-size building replicas. It was a fun and engaging place to learn about Tokyo's transition from the Edo period to present day metropolis. Update: The Edo-Tokyo Museum will be temporarily closed for renovations from April 1, 2022 until possibly spring of 2026. The entire facility will be renovated including displays, equipment and more. Read my full post about the Edo-Tokyo Museum. Check hotel prices and availability in Ryogoku Ueno Park Ueno Park is packed full of attractions and you could spend a lot of time here, if you so choose. There are temples, shrines and multiple museums, including the Tokyo National Museum, National Science Museum and Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum. We decided to stroll around outside, passing by a few statues, ponds and hundreds of cherry trees. Ueno Park is also home to Japan's oldest Zoo, Ueno Zoo. I have mixed feelings about zoos but ultimately we decided pay a visit because I've always wanted to see giant pandas. Ri Ri and Shin Shin are Ueno Zoo's biggest attraction and I couldn't help but smile as I watched them happily munch on bamboo stalks. So darn cute and wow, do they ever eat a lot! We visited some of the other animals, but I was feeling uneasy about how small some of the enclosures were, so we decided to head to the exit. On our way out though, we had to stop and say hi (okay, it was more like \"I love you\") to the red panda. My favourite animal, the red panda always charms me with its adorable face. I just want to scoop it up and cuddle with it forever! Check hotel prices and availability in Ueno Senso-ji Temple After Ueno Park, we went to the Asakusa district to see Senso-ji, Tokyo's most visited temple, and in my opinion, most spectacular thanks to the five-story pagoda and huge red paper lantern at the gate. Senso-ji Temple is very busy during the day so there are plenty of opportunities to witness people engaging in traditional rituals, such as wafting smoke over them from the large incense burner. On my second trip to Tokyo, I returned to Senso-ji at night and it was a completely different experience. There were no crowds, the grounds were quiet and the buildings looked even more dramatic when lit up by lights. Read my full post about Senso-ji Temple. Sumida River From Senso-ji Temple, we walked to nearby Sumida River to take in the nice views of the Tokyo Skytree. As we crossed the river on our way to the Skytree, we had to wonder and laugh about the interesting architecture of the Asahi Breweries headquarters ! Tokyo Skytree We ended our last full day in Tokyo by going up the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest tower, and second tallest structure, in the world. I loved visiting the Tokyo Skytree after dark since it gave us a different perspective of the city, which we had previously seen from above only during the day. We got a ticket to go up to the highest level (450 metres), but I don't think it was worth it since the view from the main observation deck (350 metres) was just as great. Besides the fantastic views, I appreciated that photographers are allowed to use tripods, so I got some good photos of Tokyo at night, even when shooting through glass. We were hoping to eat supper at the top of the Skytree, but the restaurant was already closing. Instead we went to a different tower of the Skytree Town (a complex of restaurants, shops and other attractions) to eat a late dinner. It was actually pretty cool to eat where we did because all the tables were set up to face the Skytree, so we got to admire it while we ate. C heck hotel prices and availability in Asakusa Day 4- Day Trip to Nikko For our last day in Tokyo we decided to do a day trip to Nikko. A forested area dotted with temples and shrines, Nikko was a welcome break from the towers and crowded streets of Tokyo. We had a fabulous day exploring Nikko's sacred areas and taking walks in nature, but the highlight was visiting the surprisingly lavish Nikko Toshogu Shrine. Read my full post about our day trip to Nikko. Final Thoughts on Our 4 Days in Tokyo It took me a while to warm up to Tokyo but eventually I did come around to liking it. After two visits, I now consider it to be one of the world's greatest cities and best places in Japan to visit. We liked how Tokyo had something to please both of us. There were high-rises, a fast-paced atmosphere and quirky pop-culture for Mike, along with pockets of nature, spiritual spaces and traditional architecture for me. Getting to experience the effortless mix of old and new, man-made and nature, is just one reason why we think Tokyo belongs on a Japan bucket list. Yasuda Garden in Ryogoku. What was most impressive, however, was how clean and efficient Tokyo was. Litter on the street was almost non-existent and public transportation (coupled with a culture of order and respect) enabled millions of people to move around the city with ease. Sprawling in size, Tokyo can at first be overwhelming. It requires some thoughtful planning to make the most of your time, but it's a city you could visit over and over again and always discover something new! National Sumo Stadium in Ryogoku. More Places to See in Tokyo Since writing this post, I've made a third trip to Tokyo and have a few more places I'd recommend adding to your Tokyo itinerary. Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden I absolutely loved Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in East Shinjuku. I spent an entire afternoon strolling around the park and its different gardens, even finding some early blooming cherry trees. In my opinion, this is Tokyo's most beautiful park, way prettier than Ueno Park. Nezu Shrine Nezu Shrine is under the radar of most tourists so it's a pleasant place to visit if you want to avoid crowds. It's one of Tokyo's oldest shrines and features a tunnel of small torii gates and hillside of azalea bushes. Nezu Shrine is in the Bunkyo ward, an easy 20 minute walk from Ueno Park. Read my full post about Nezu Shrine. Tips for Visiting Tokyo Getting to and from the Airports: Tokyo has two major airports- Narita and Haneda. I've flown into both and preferred Haneda because it is way closer to the city centre than Narita (which is 66 kms away from central Tokyo). Narita Airport: The fastest and (usually cheapest) way to get to the city is by train. We took the Narita Express to Tokyo Station and it took a little less than an hour. The Narita Express also goes to Shinjuku, Shibuya and Shinagawa stations. Trains run every half-hour and tickets can be bought in the airport terminals. Japan Rail Pass holders can ride for free. Limousine buses leave hourly and shuttle visitors to major hotels and train stations. Plan to spend 1.5- 2 hours on the bus. If you prefer to use a shared transfer/shuttle van for direct to hotel service, here is where you can book a transfer to/from Narita Airport. Don't take a taxi from Narita airport- it will cost a fortune! Haneda Airport: I used the Tokyo Monorail (free with a JR Pass) to get from Haneda airport to Hamamatsucho station on the JR Yamanote line. It takes about 15 minutes. Once on the Yamanote line you can get to the major train stations. Limousine buses leave hourly and stop at major stations like Shibuya, Shinjuku and Tokyo. Buses operate between 5:00 am and 12:30 am. If you'd like to use a shared transfer/shuttle van for direct to hotel service, here is where you can book a transfer from Haneda Airport. Using the Subway in Tokyo: Tokyo's subway system is a massive network, but the colour-coded maps and bilingual signage make it very easy to use. The subway is operated by two different companies. Tokyo Metro operates nine lines and Toei operates four. It's important to note which group you will be using, as they require separate tickets. It's easy to purchase tickets as the machines have an English option. You can buy single fare tickets or choose from a few day pass options. The machines accept coins and bills. Fares are determined according to how far you ride and are displayed on the large map above the ticket machines. If you are not sure how much to pay, just buy the least expensive ticket and use the fare adjustor machine at the exit gate of your destination station to pay the remaining amount. Instead of buying individual tickets, you can get a Suica or Pasmo Card. This prepaid card is valid on all subway, local rail and bus lines in Tokyo (and most regions in Japan). Simply touch the card to the electronic reader and the cost of your trip will be debited. The Suica and Pasmo cards can be reloaded with more yen if needed. You can also buy a Tokyo Subway Ticket. Tickets include unlimited access to all Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway lines and are valid for 24, 48, or 72 consecutive hours. They can be purchased online here (you will be sent a QR code that needs to be exchanged for a physical ticket at a ticket vending machine in major stations). Tokyo's subway can be very busy and crowded (especially between 8:00 am-9:30 am and 5:00 pm-8:00 pm). Be prepared to have to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with other commuters. People are very quiet on subways and trains. Follow the locals' lead and refrain from talking loudly and using your cell phone. The Japanese make orderly line-ups when waiting for the subway (it's marked on the platform where the doors will be when the train stops). When the train doors open, people will move aside and stand along the train, making it easy for passengers to get off. The whole subway system in Tokyo shuts down around midnight until 5:00 am. There are subway cars that are designated for women only. Taking the Train (Japan Rail) in Tokyo: In addition to the subway, Japan Rail also operates within the city. The JR Yamanote line makes a loop around Tokyo and stops at the city's main hubs including Shinjuku, Shibuya, Shimbashi, Tokyo and Ueno stations. We used this line a few times during our 4 days in Tokyo. If you have a Japan Rail Pass ( purchase online here) you can travel for free on the Yamanote line, the Narita Express (serves Narita airport), the Tokyo Monorail (serves Haneda airport), and a few other JR lines that cross the city. Get an eSIM from Airalo so that you have access to affordable data for checking train schedules on the go. Credit Cards and ATMs: Most places in Tokyo take credit cards (but not all taxis). We had no trouble using them at hotels and restaurants. Our bank cards worked fine at ATMs in Tokyo. The best place to find ATMs that work with foreign debit cards is at 7-Eleven. You can also find English ATMs at Post offices, but they are closed on evenings and weekends. Shinjuku Tours in Tokyo Here is a trusted site that has a huge inventory of tours and tickets for activities in Tokyo. You can book everything from themed walking tours, cooking classes, shows, bike tours, cultural craft and art experiences, day trips out of the city, and private tours with a local.

Fuji -- Adventures with Pinny 0 One Week in Japan Itinerary: Kyoto, Tokyo, Nara, Mt. Fuji Asia Japan Dec 23 Written By Linny and Peter This one week itinerary is perfect for travelers visiting Japan for the first time. It hits the top, must-see destinations in both Kyoto and Tokyo including day trips to Nara and Mt. Fuji. And it has been tried and tested by another first-time traveler to Japan - me! I had the opportunity to visit Japan for a one week trip. It was my first trip to Japan and planning for it was stressful. How would we get by without knowing Japanese? Would we know how to use the public transportation? While preparing for this trip I did a TON of research and am quite proud of the itinerary and plans that I put together for it. So, I am sharing my one week Japan itinerary along with all of my favorite experiences and tips that I learned during my time in Japan, for others like me who might be stressed out searching high and low across the internet for this information. Table of Contents Show Of course, if you are staying in Japan for more or less time than one week or want to visit different spots in Japan than I did, you can adjust this itinerary as needed. I hope that this blog post can act as a guide for you and provide you with the tips that you need to get started with your own Japan itinerary planning. My trip was \"one week\" off of work, but including the weekends before and after really made it a 9 day trip. Below are the 9 days of my Japan trip outlined from start to finish.

Important Tips to Know Before Your Trip to Japan Listed below are the top Japan travel tips that I learned from my research and confirmed with my own experience traveling to Japan. Make sure to read the Japan Travel Guide for the full list of tips along with detailed explanation on each of these points. Reserve a pocket wifi Buy a Japan Rail Pass How to get around Japan + how to use Japan's rail system Bring Japanese Yen Outlet types + voltage in Japan Do you need to know Japanese? Etiquette in Japan Basics Safety in Japan What to pack for a trip to Japan READ THE FULL GUIDE HERE: Japan Travel Guide: Tips and Packing List for First Time Visitors Photo credit: Unsplash Day 1: Arrive in Tokyo, Travel Day Unless you live in Asia or close to Japan, Day 1 will likely be just a travel day. In my case with a 16 hour time difference and an 11-hour flight, that was definitely the case. You will probably be flying into the Narita Airport just outside of Tokyo, which is Japan's largest international airport. Feeling hungry after your flight, or need to wait for a friend to arrive? Narita Airport is 5 floors, the 4th and 5th boasting a large array of shops and restaurants to keep you entertained. Upon arriving I recommend doing 2 very important things at the airport: pick up your pocket wifi and exchange your JR Pass voucher for the actual Rail Pass (read the Japan Travel Guide to understand why these things are so important). Pick up your Pocket Wifi When you reserve your pocket wifi online you'll be able to specify which airport you're flying into and which terminal, and they'll give you all of the details on where to pick up your rental. I reserved mine through Global Advanced Communications. My pocket wifi was waiting for me at the airport Post Office. Since I came in internationally, I was in Terminal 1 of Narita Airport. After making it through security, the Post Office was on the 4th floor of Terminal 1 and was easy to find. Exchange your voucher for the Japan Rail Pass Activating the JR Pass at Narita Airport is quick and easy. The lowest level of the Narita Airport, the B1 floor, connects with the rail system. Just outside of the station on the B1 floor of both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2-3, look for the JR East Travel Service Center. Here you will be able to exchange your JR Pass voucher for your actual Japan Rail Pass. All you need is your voucher and your passport. The attendants of the service center speak English and are very helpful if you have any questions. The hours of the JR East Travel Service Centers are 8:15 - 19:00 (Terminal 1) and 8:15 - 20:00 (Terminal 2-3), open every day of the year. If for some reason your flight arrives after the JR East Travel Service Center is already closed (this was the case for my friend), you can exchange your voucher the next day at the JR Service Center within Tokyo Station before taking the bullet train to Kyoto. You'll just have to pay for this first ride from Narita to Tokyo Station with cash using the ticketing machine at the station outside the platform. JR East has a pricing table you can check - the ride from Narita to Tokyo on the Narita Express costs 3,020 yen (roughly $30 USD). Take the Narita Express to Tokyo Station Once you're ready to leave the airport, head to the bottom level of the airport, the B1 floor, if you're not there already from exchanging your JR Pass. Take the JR Narita Express (NEX) to Tokyo Station. This is a JR line so you can use your JR Pass at no additional cost. The ride is about 50 minutes long. Hotel near Tokyo Station By the time we got to Tokyo Station it was around midnight, so we walked to our hotel that we had booked for the night near Tokyo Station and went right to bed to rest up for the early start the next day. For this night's hotel, our only criteria was that it be relatively cheap, within walking distance of Tokyo Station, and preferably have two beds. Well we found the perfect match! We ended up staying at Center Hotel Tokyo. It was about an 11-14 minute walk with our luggage from the station. It wasn't anything fancy, but it was a nice place to sleep after a long day of travel and even included breakfast! Book your stay: Center Hotel Tokyo on Hotels. Com Photo credit: Unsplash Day 2-4: Kyoto Ride the Shinkansen bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto From Tokyo Station, you will take the Tokaido Shinkansen (bullet train) to Kyoto. There are 3 trains that are a part of the Tokaido Shinkansen line: Hikari, Kodama, and the Nozomi. The Nozomi is not a part of JR Group and is not covered with the Japan Rail Pass. Both the Kodama and Hikari lines are covered by the Japan Rail Pass. The Kodama line makes more stops at smaller cities and takes about 4 hours to reach Kyoto, while the Hikari line is about a 2.5 hour ride at 320 km/h (199 mph), stopping only at the major cities along the way. So you will want to take the Hikari line to save time. You can get tickets at the station outside the Shinkansen gates at ticketing machines or reserve seats with the help of an attendant at the Tokyo Station JR East Travel Service Center (which is what we did our first time). If you don't have a Japan Rail Pass for some reason, a one-way ticket on the bullet train will cost you 13,080 yen for an unreserved seat, which is about $118 USD at the time of this post. You can see how a JR Pass will quickly pay for itself! Where to stay in Kyoto Where We Stayed The Royal Park Hotel was our home during our few days in Kyoto. It was rather spacious and modern and is only a short walk from the nearest train station. To get here from Kyoto Station, take the Karasuma line, then transfer to the Tozai line to arrive at Sanjo Station. From Sanjo station, the hotel is just a 3-minute walk across a bridge on the Kamo River. I was very happy with our hotel - in fact, it was my favorite from our entire stay in Japan for its high quality for a moderate price. Book your stay: The Royal Park Hotel Sanjo on Hotels. Com From the research that I did before my trip, this area came up as \"the area to stay\" while in Kyoto and it didn't disappoint, with plenty of cool shops and restaurants along with the nearby Shinkyogoku Shopping District. Other High-End or Cheaper Hotel Options If you're looking for something a little more luxurious for your stay in Kyoto, check out Hyatt Regency Kyoto, the Four Seasons Hotel Kyoto, or The Ritz-Carlton Kyoto. And if you'd like to see some cheaper options, look at the popular Hotel Sunroute Kyoto, the Tour Club, or K's House Kyoto Hostel. Explore more Kyoto hotel options on Hotels. Com Things to do in Kyoto Welcome to Kyoto, Japan's famed historical city. Here are a few things we did in Kyoto that I would highly recommend experiencing during your trip: Fushimi Inari Taisha Fushimi Inari-taisha: the iconic, endless orange-red gates that wind up the trail to the peak of Mt. Inari, with countless moss-covered stone shrines along the path. Keep in mind, this is an actual hike. The hike takes 2 to 3 hours roundtrip and is about 5km long, up the 233 meter height of Mt. Inari. You don't have to do the entire hike, but the beginning is the most crowded and if you continue on you can have parts of this magical trail all to yourself. This was my favorite thing from the one week I spent in Japan. Definitely try to make it here if you have the chance. Read more: Visiting Fushimi Inari-taisha: The Most Magical Place in Kyoto Kinkaku-ji Temple, The Golden Pavilion Kinkaku-ji Temple was like something from a dream. The Golden Pavilion is covered in gold leaf, which is where it gets its name. It really was a magical sight to behold that I recommend visiting. Just mentally prepare yourself for the crowds of people, which are to be expected at an awe-inspiring destination with such a rich history. And the entry fee is only 400 yen (about $4.00 USD).

Take a stroll through the bamboo forest and lose yourself in its serenity. While in Arashiyama, you can explore the local restaurants and do some souvenir shopping. There is also a nearby Monkey Park in Arashiyama you can check out if you have the time. And when you're ready to leave, make sure to visit the underrated, colorfully-decorated poles of the Kimono Forest. My recommendation: Wait until it gets dark to experience the magic of the kimono-patterned \"forest\" fully illuminated. Read more: Exploring Arashiyama Bamboo Forest in Kyoto, Japan Day 5: Nara How to get there We checked out of our Kyoto hotel and went to Kyoto Station. At Kyoto Station, we used one of the lockers to store our luggage for the day. There are tons of lockers available for use all around the station, just follow the \"coin lockers\" signs. They come in a variety of sizes and cost between 300, 500 and 700 yen. Take note of which locker number you stored your bags in and where the locker is located within Kyoto Station so that you can easily pick up your luggage at the end of the day! From Kyoto Station, take the JR Nara Line all the way to Nara Station. This is a 1-hour train ride that is free with your Japan Rail Pass or 710 yen without a JR pass. Kofukuji Temple: Five-Story Wooden Pagoda On your walk from Nara Station to Nara deer park, make a stop at the Kofukuji Temple along the way. Kofukuji is home to a collection of buildings across its grounds including a five-story pagoda and three-story pagoda. The five-story pagoda is the second tallest wooden pagoda in all of Japan! If you have more time in Nara, you can also check out Nara's other temples and shrines. Besides Kofukuji, Nara is notably home to Todaiji which is one of Japan's most famous temples. Kofukuji and Todaiji are both a part of Nara's Seven Great Temples. Nara Deer Park Visiting the deer park is a fun and unique experience, and something you've probably heard about if you've researched things to do when visiting Japan. Nara deer park is home to over a thousand free-roaming, wild shika deer. Although they are wild, they are quite friendly and you can even buy biscuits to feed them! The size of the park is over 1,000 acres, so you can easily spend hours here walking the paths and interacting with the deer. Entrance to Nara deer park is free and a pack of biscuits to feed the deer is only 150 yen (which is about $1.50 USD). Read more: A Day in Nara: Visiting Japan's Amazing Deer Park! Try Okonomiyaki What is okonomiyaki, you may be asking? Only a super delicious, savory Japanese pancake. The Japanese word \"okonomiyaki\" translates to \"grilled as you like it\". Its origins are of the Kansai region of Japan, and specifically Osaka. Since this one-week itinerary didn't include Osaka, Nara was the closest next-best thing. There are several restaurants in town that specialize in okonomiyaki and you can watch the chef grill them right in front of you. Obviously, you should also have ramen, udon, sushi, and all the other delicious Japanese foods that you can think of during your trip to Japan (seriously I ate so much on this trip). But I just mention okonomiyaki since it's something \"different\" that many people outside of Japan might not know about and it is so good! Back to Kyoto then onward to Tokyo Once our day trip to Nara was over, we took the JR Nara Line back to Kyoto Station where we picked up our bags from the lockers we had stored them in at the beginning of the day. Then onto the Shinkansen bullet train for a second time to make the same trip from Day 2 but in reverse back to Tokyo. Once again, the ride is about 2.5 hours long and is no extra cost with a Japan Rail Pass. We arrived in Tokyo very late that night and went directly to our hotel to check in and get to bed. It would be another early start in the morning for a day trip to Mt. Fuji. Photo credit: Unsplash Day 6: Mt. Fuji How to get there Early in the morning, take a train from Tokyo to Kawaguchiko station for a full day trip exploring the area around Mt. Fuji. From Shinjuku Station, take the Kaiji Limited Express to Otsuki. Transfer from there to the Fujikyuko line (a privately held railway that costs about ¥1,440) to go to Kawaguchiko station. This all takes about 2 hours travel time. At Kawaguchiko station, there are buses you can take to get all around the area. Below are some options of things to do while you're there. We spent one day in the Mt. Fuji area and were only able to do a couple of these things, but if you have the time to spend an extra day or two in the area and explore more I would recommend it! You could hike the mountain or explore more of the five lakes surrounding Mt. Fuji. It was so peaceful here away from the hustle and bustle of the big cities. Photo credit: Unsplash Lake Kawaguchiko Lake Kawaguchiko is the most accessible of the five lakes surrounding Mt. Fuji and is a favorite spot to view the mountain for good reason. Viewing Mt. Fuji from across the lake on its northern side makes for a beautiful scene, even if it's on a cloudy day like the day we went. If the water of Lake Kawaguchiko is calm, the image of Mt. Fuji may be reflected in the lake. And if your trip is around mid-April, you might even be lucky enough to enjoy the view with cherry blossoms (check the cherry blossom forecast before your trip). Getting to and around Lake Kawaguchiko is easy from Kawaguchiko Station by taking the Omni Bus lines. You will need Yen coins for payment to drop in the machine on the bus, or you can buy the unlimited 2-day pass for 1,500 yen. 5th Station Mt. Fuji You can take the Subaru Line toll road to Fuji Subaru Line 5th Station, located at the lower slopes of Mt. Fuji. If your trip to Japan is during the correct time of year (between July and September) and have an extra day to spend in the area you could even make the hike up Mt. Fuji from here! It's about a 9 hour hike round trip, and definitely on my bucket list. But the Fuji Subaru 5th Station is also a popular sightseeing spot, offering an impressive view of the five lakes area below. Photo credit: Unsplash Aokigahara Forest Also known as \"Suicide Forest\" or the \"Sea of Trees\", Aokigahara forest is thick with towering trees and known for its both eerie and magical nature. You can access the forest by bus from Kawaguchiko Station. There are multiple bus stops throughout the forest for different walking trails. Just stay on the trail and be respectful of the area. From the Omni Bus Green Line, there are several stops at caves that lie deep within the forest including Narusawa Ice Cave, Saiko Bat Cave, and the Fugaku Wind Cave. Photo credit: Unsplash Day 7-8: Tokyo Where to stay in Tokyo After doing some research, we decided to stay in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo. This area had a lot to offer in terms of restaurants and things to do, and our hotel was within walking distance of Shinjuku Station, a major station in Tokyo's rail system. Shinjuku Station helped us stay closely connected to the entire city of Tokyo as well as keeping other nearby areas of Japan easily accessible to us for day trips. I was very satisfied with our choice thanks to its central location and yet it was just far enough from the main busy streets of Shinjuku that it was never too loud at night. Hotels in Shinjuku Where We Stayed We chose to stay at the Hotel Rose Garden Shinjuku for its quality for the best price. Our room was a decent size and had two separate twin beds - pretty much our only stipulation for hotels and yet harder to find in Japan than one might imagine! Book your stay: Hotel Rose Garden Shinjuku on Hotels. Com Other High-End or Cheaper Hotel Options However, there are much nicer hotels in the area if you have the budget. If you're looking for a more luxurious or comfortable option in the Shinjuku area, check out the Keio Plaza Hotel, the Hilton Tokyo, or the Park Hyatt Tokyo. And conversely, if you're on a tighter budget, you can check out the Imano Tokyo Hostel or even stay at a capsule hotel. Explore more hotels in Shinjuku on Hotels. Com Things to do in Tokyo After enjoying the historic Kyoto, it is time to experience Japan's ultra-modern culture of Tokyo. Tokyo is the largest city in the world, and there's no way to see all that it has to offer in a couple of days. These are just a few of the things we did during our short time in Tokyo that I recommend: Tokyo Tower Tokyo Tower is the world's tallest, self-supported steel tower, taller than the Eiffel Tower that it was modeled after. This tower is an iconic part of the Tokyo skyline and a popular tourist destination for that reason. For ¥900 you can go to the observation deck at the top for some lovely views of the city. Along with the walls of windows, the observation deck is home to a souvenir shop and a cafe. Tokyo Skytree Along with Tokyo Tower, you can also check out Tokyo's taller observatory, Tokyo Skytree. When we went it was rainy and cloudy from the observatory deck so we opted out. They have screens broadcasting the view from the top at the entrance which is helpful when making your decision. Admission to the Skytree's highest observation deck on floor 450 is ¥1,030, but they also offer tickets to their floor 350 observation deck and \"Fast Skytree Tickets\" for an added cost. Sensō-ji Temple Sensoji Temple, also known as Asakusa Kannon Temple, is Tokyo's oldest and most significant temple, originally built in 645. Among the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, this beautiful temple offers a peaceful escape. At night the temple is lit up which adds to its striking beauty. If you do come during the day, the street ahead of the temple is lined with shops and booths selling crafts, souvenirs, and sweet and savory snacks. Visit Harajuku The Harajuku district is known for its over-the-top style and shopping. We spent hours walking down the narrow streets shopping for souvenirs and people watching. While in Harajuku we also stopped at the eccentric Kawaii Monster Cafe, with crazy, colorful decor and just as colorful menu items. The food is a little overpriced, but you're really paying for the experience. Shibuya Crossing On an average night, you can find this chaotic crossing filled with hundreds of people walking in different directions. A street crossing may seem trivial, but the sheer size, complexity, and the overwhelming number of people made it fascinating. Shibuya Crossing is the busiest pedestrian crossing in the world ! We stopped to watch people cross at least five separate times, then joined in ourselves a couple of times. Hachikō Statue While you're at Shibuya Crossing, make sure to stop by the Hachikō Statue just outside of Shibuya Station. This statue is modeled after the famous Akita dog named Hachikō, the \"most loyal dog in Japan\", who waited for his owner to return from his commute each day outside of Shibuya Station in the 1920s. After his owner died, Hachikō continued to come to wait for his return at the station daily for 9 years. The story of the dog Hachikō's loyalty has become a symbol of pride for Japan and this statue was created in his honor. Tsukiji Fish Market The Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo is one of the oldest and largest fish markets in the world, famous for its sprawling wholesale fish and food selection. The area is tightly packed with booths and shops of owners selling their wares, everything from ceramics to knives, as well as innumerable food stalls and restaurants. You will have no trouble finding fresh fish to eat here. This bustling market is the perfect place to hunt for souvenirs and try some ultra-fresh sushi! Udon Shin Udon Shin in Shinjuku was literally my favorite meal from my entire trip to Japan. The flavorful broth, the soft noodles, the tender meat... I definitely recommend giving Udon Shin a try while you're in Tokyo in the Shinjuku area. Expect a bit of a wait when you come here as this is a popular spot for good reason. We arrived around 6:30pm and had about a 45minute wait in the chilly autumn rain. In the meantime, you can scour the Udon Shin Yelp reviews and get hyped. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Linny + Peter (@adventureswithpinny) Day 9: Goodbye, Japan! Tokyo to Narita Airport Another travel day, but this one much sadder than the first day because it is leaving Japan. I went to the nearby Shinjuku Station and took an express train back to Narita airport directly from there. Since I bought the 7-day Japan Rail Pass and it expired that day, I went to the ticket booth to buy my ticket. It was about $30 USD and you can pay with a credit card (a good thing for me since I was out of yen at this point). If your rail pass isn't going to be expired, I would recommend taking the rail to Tokyo Station and then riding the JR Narita Express (NEX) from there, as it will be no extra cost with a JR Pass. After about a one hour ride watching the final glimpses of Japan flash by your window, you will be back at the Narita Airport where you started your journey through Japan. Go to your terminal, check in for your flight, make it through airport security... you know the drill. Until Next Time One week is not enough time to fully explore any country and I can't wait to return to Japan someday to delve deeper into its culture. I want to see the cherry blossom season and climb Mt. Fuji! To learn more about my one week in Japan and the things that I did there, make sure to check out the individual blog posts listed below.

Updated October 2023 Welcome to Tokyo and its maze of bright lights, restaurants, and everything else imaginative that fills in the cracks. This first-timer's guide to Tokyo is just the start to the endless adventures in this city. I will never forget the moment I walked out in Shinjuku Station. It was my first glimpse of the city -- seas of people passing by, vendors selling an assortment of oddly-colored food -- all sights and smells that I would soon grow accustomed to. The sheer vibrancy of the city is hard to soak in and even after five days in Tokyo, I could have gone back for more. Spots like small coffee shops tucked in lush corners of the city to shops specializing in hilariously cartooned characters, make Tokyo, well Tokyo. It's the weird and the wonderful. Anthony Bourdain said it well: \"Tokyo may well be the most amazing food city in the world, with a nearly unimaginable variety of places stacked one on top of the other, tucked away on every level on densely-packed streets.\" It's hard to say where to begin. The city is large, but a smart and efficient network of underground rail connects it all together. Daunting, but an unfamiliar orderliness makes Tokyo work the way it does. It's clean, it's organized, and somehow it blends beautifully. There's no sense of urgency, as they know that each person has a task done to be done, and through the quietness and peaceful lining up at a train stop, you can spot a glimpse of this. Tokyo is mesmerizing. It waits for those willing to step into a world that most will never understand, but can, at the very least, scratch the surface. Short on Time?

The First-Timer's Guide to Tokyo What to Know Before Visiting Tokyo How to Get to Tokyo from Narita International Airport To access the city from Narita International Airport (the most recommended, as it has the best options to getting into Tokyo), is via the Narita Express or local trains. The JR Rail Pass covers a few of the lines, which is recommended as it's around $30 a person. Expect at least an hour to hour and half to Shinjuku/Shibuya area. What's the Best Way to Get Around Tokyo? The entire city is easily traversed by foot, train, or bus. The Suica card is helpful for using the bus and local train. You can get one at the main stations and, with a small deposit, have access to reload this card. If you have a JR Rail Pass, this is also applicable for certain lines in Tokyo. Be sure to apply and purchase your JR Rail Pass prior to arrival in Japan. Travel Tip: Be sure to apply and purchase your JR Rail Pass before arrival in Japan. Are Credit Cards Accepted in Tokyo? Japan, even though it is incredibly modern, is still a primarily cash-only country. Carry Yen on you at all times to cover meals, shopping, and transportation. The best place to withdraw cash is at a Seven Eleven ATM's. When is the Best Time to Visit the Top Attractions in Tokyo? For all sights, if you're looking for those \"no crowd\" photos, be sure to arrive no later than 7:30/8 am. The top attractions will get incredibly busy and it is worth it to get up a bit earlier. Are Restaurant Reservations Required in Tokyo? Most restaurants need reservations far in advance. The best way to handle any restaurant reservation is to have your hotel concierge call and reserve. There were quite a few where we couldn't get one almost two-three weeks in advance. Where to Stay in Tokyo For our trip, we rented an Airbnb with friends in a quiet area left ofYoyogi Park. If you're looking to rent an Airbnb (use this link for $40 off your first booking), the corridor betweenHigashi-Kitazawa Station and Yoyogi Park is really nice and quiet. It's ideal to be within walking distance of a train station. Though Shinjuku and Shibuya are the best stations to be nearby, I would not recommend staying in those neighborhoods if you are looking for something quieter. Tokyo is a vast city and where to stay has a big influence on your experience. For an in-depth guide to Tokyo's neighborhoods and my recommendations for the best hotels in each, read my 5-day Tokyo itinerary. If you're short on time, here are my top picks from that post: JR-East Hotel Mets Shibuya, for the best location Shibuya Granbell Hotel, for the best location Hotel Emit, for the best boutique hotel Mustard Hotel, for the best modern hotel For the full list of recommendations, read the full post here.

It took us approximately3 hoursto arrive at Shinjuku Station from Kyoto. It was only supposed to take us 2 hours and 45 minutes. Click here to find out why it took us a little longer than expected. Upon arrival, we checked into our hotel: Hotel Century (Southern Tower). After checking in, we left immediately for Shibuya crossing. Right outside of Shibuya Station stands a dedicated statue of Hachiko. Long story short, it was a friendly and loyal dog to his master and beloved by everyone. He walked with his master to his train stop everyday and waited for him to get back. Hachiko knew what time the master would come and waited patiently for his return. Upon the death of his master, Hachiko continued his journey of walking to the station where his master would board and persisted on waiting even though his master had long passed. One morning, Hachiko didn't show up. The end. The famous Shibuya crossing! It was smaller than I had imagined but was still an amazing sight to see all these busy humans. DAY 2: DISNEY SEA AND ODAIBA We started our second day off at DisneySea -A unique disney with 7 different themes, all aquatic related. A short train ride away from DisneySea was Odaiba Island - We saw a famous earth protector - Gundam. There are also many shopping areas in Odaiba which is what makes it a hot tourist spot now. It was previously used as for defensive purposes. Tokyo Bay - The coast line at the bottom of Odaiba's central walkway. DAY 3: TOKYO SKYTREE AND ROBOT RESTAURANT I've stated it before in other posts but I'll say it again - The Japanese are amazing at building magnificent structures in the middle of a metropolis. We were able to visit one of these wonders on our third day in Tokyo. The Tokyo Skytree is the tallest building in Japan and should be on your bucket list while visiting Japan. After our admiration of the Skytree, we headed to lower ground and visited the last temple of our visit. Temples represent peace, unity, collaboration, and reverence yet, Japan has many of these sacred stops in the middle of the city which is both an achievement and irony. I believe the best way to view it is: \"in the middle of chaos (the city) you can find peace (temples).\"This was the Sensoji-Tokyo Pagoda. We rounded up the busy day with Robot Restaurant - An onslaught of lights, sounds and movements. Talk about sensory overload! A high-pace tale told through Japanese style storytelling which means overly done costumes, personalities and body language. It was definitely worth the price ($70USD-$120USD) and great for all ages. The show has many variations so the show we saw may be vastly different from what you may see! DAY 4: TSUKIJI FISH MARKET AND HARAJUKU On our last day in Tokyo, we visited my favorite spot - Tsukiji Fish Market. The best place I have ever eaten raw fish (and I'm not too much of a raw fish lover). Tsukiji Market made me love fish and now I can't wait to go back for more! Nothing in Hawaii can compare, not even Paina Cafe. Although, it is a close competition to my taste buds. Our last and final stop in Japan, other than the airport, was Harajuku. Gwen Stafani made it famous with her song Harajuku Girls. However, manyurban styles originate from here and is a very flashy youth scene. It only gets better (and busier) as the night draws near. There are MANY things to do and visit while in Tokyo and I'm sure we were only able to scratch the surface. Four days to spend in a city as big as small countries is too short if you ask me. Possible our next visit we can spend a little more time in Tokyo, say a week? After visiting the \"main\" attractions I'm sure we can see and do more next time. If you visited something not on our list, let us know so we can add it to our bucket list! ( source) PINIT! \"We live in a rainbow of chaos.\" - Paul Cezanne"}]}

Dubai has never been high on my list of places to visit. My preconception was that it's largely all for show, full of high rises and little soul. But last year I was away for my birthday in the freezing cold temperatures of Europe, and decided I needed sunshine this year instead. With only 5 days off work, I couldn't go too far - so the Middle East beckoned and I ended up settling on Dubai due to an amazing flight deal. It is a crazy city, like a mega metropolis plonked in the middle of the desert. It's such a contrast - on the one hand you have traditional, reserved, Emirati culture (but local Emirati's make up only 11% of the country's population), and on the other you have mega corporations, glitz, glam and tourists galore (with ex-pats making up a whopping 88% of the population)! I'll be honest, it's hard not to be drawn in by the glitz and glam, and it's really awe inspiring seeing what's been built here. It's fun to see the skyscrapers, get lost in the most ridiculous mall, eat all the delicious food, and enjoy all the OTT madness. Equally, I do think some of that is quite surface level and so it's also important to find glimpses of tradition, and to embrace some authentic Emirate culture, food and experiences too. So my recommended itinerary for 2 days in this amazing city try to mix the two a bit. I hope you enjoy it!

Dubai Miracle Garden Aya Universe Dubai Desert Getting around in Dubai Where to stay in Dubai? Itinerary Day 1: Modern Dubai Dubai Mall Full post: HERE Where to even start. Dubai Mall is utterly INSANE. In what I can only describe as the most mega of all malls I've ever stepped foot in, be prepared to spend at least a few hours here. We actually spent 7 hours inside the mall, and there's too much to cover here so I've written a full guide above. As a brief overview, you can visit any of the 1,200 shops, go ice skating on a full size ice rink, visit an aquarium, enjoy a huge arcade, see a dinosaur skeleton, taste your way through the food court, visit China Town, drive an F1 car, fly an Emirates plane simulator, get scared in a haunted house, walk an art trail, immerse yourself in VR, and even see an indoor waterfall! Waterfalls and China Town Ice rinks and dinosaurs Souk al Bahar Crossing from the mall, through the park, brings you to a bridge across to Souk al Bahar. Home to shops which are more like very modern traditional souks (i. E. in a glam new building, but stock more traditional wears), you can get better deals and prices here but you need to haggle. I bought some fresh fruit, and haggling over my grapes was part of the fun. Inside the modern Souk Dubai Brunch After the mall, it's time to embrace a modern Dubai tradition; brunch. Normally served from 12pm - 4pm, it's like a way of life here and around every corner we were offered Vietnamese, Mexican, Italian, Lebanese and Indian brunches. We had a couple of brunches whilst in the city - including Vietnamese at Hoi An, and Chinese at New Shanghai. Both were delicious, and there are lots of options in and around the mall to save you travelling. All the delicious brunch food Burj Khalifa & Park From within Dubai Mall, you can visit 'At the Top' which enables you to visit the top of Dubai's iconic Burj Khalifa. If heights aren't your thing then you can also view it from just outside the mall (follow the signs to the Dubai Fountain) where you get lovely views and can stroll around the parks outside. The Burj and in the park Dubai Fountain (6pm onwards) To round off your day in and around the mall, head out of the Souk and towards Dubai Fountain in the evening. Every 30 minutes from 6pm - 11pm (also at 1pm during the day), the amazing light show goes. It's different every time as well so even better if you get to see two sittings! It's really stunning and we had an absolutely amazing time watching it, though it does get busy. If you want an extra special treat, book an evening table at Amal by Armani Indian restaurant. Situated within the Burj Khalifa in the Armani Hotel is the most delicious Indian with a balcony overlooking the fountain so you can watch the lightshow without the crowds. This was my birthday treat and we had a 3 course awesome meal, plus saw 5 rounds of the light show. The fountain light show (L), and my dinner with a view (R) The View at 42 (Shangri-La Hotel) Full review: HERE We stayed at the Shangri-La, but whether you choose to stay there or not, you can finish off your modern Dubai day with a treat - one of the best views in the whole city! It's a short taxi ride from the Mall area and well worth it to look out to the Burj Khalifa and all the sprawling roads laid out in front of it by night. Magic. The view at varying levels of night Optional: Souk Madinat Jumeirah & Burj Al Arab If you don't think you're going to need as much time as we did in the Dubai Mall area, then I recommend starting your day in the wonderful area of Souk Madinat and Burj Al Arab (around a 15 minute drive from the Mall). This area is really beautiful to stroll around with lots of little shops, pretty buildings and views. You could also choose to take an Abra boat ride on the water for something extra special. In the Souk (L) and its beautiful views (R) Admirning the Burj al Arab (L), Souk entrance (R) Itinerary Day 2: Traditional Dubai Grand Bur Dubai Mosque I always think it's important to understand more about what we don't live every day, and it was important to me coming to Dubai to understand more about Islam. I've done mosque tours in the UK before, but also wanted to visit and learn more here too. We therefore went on the 9-10am tour at Grand Bur Mosque. I was given an Abaya to wear, and we were given an ablution demonstration, a tour of the Mosque's interior, a demonstration of the call to prayer and taken through the core beliefs of Islam. The mosque was beautiful inside, though of course I didn't take any photos as that wasn't appropriate. At the mosque Al Fahidi Historic Neighbourhood This was one of my favourite parts about visiting Dubai. Just a short walk from the Mosque, and miles away from modern Dubai is the old town area, home to traditional cafes, tea rooms, art galleries and even a traditional Emirati house to visit. We happily spent 2 hours wandering around and going in all the little shops and winding mazes of lanes. In the historic district Lovely Al Khayma Heritage Restaurant After a morning exploring, it was time to refuel, and where better than in a traditional Emirati restaurant. There are plenty in the area and we settled on Al Khayma, which was absolutely delicious! The food was insane. So insane it went straight in my mouth and I forgot to take any photos which is always the best compliment I can give a meal! Dubai Creek The creek forms a natural port, and actually stretches for around 15km, weaving through modern Dubai as a reminder of its past in the fishing and pearl industries. It's hard to believe that just 50 years ago, barely any of the city we see today was here - rather it was mainly desert with smaller dwellings. Its change over the course of the last few decades has been incredible, and has to be admired. Today the creek is still busy, and offers boat tours across to Deira and its gold souks, or inland all the way to the Burj. Views along the creek Jumeirah Mosque From the creek we headed to the Etihad Museum, but first stopped at Jumierah Mosque (just a short walk from the museum) to see it from the outside. It's truly beautiful. Walking by Jumeirah Mosque Etihad Museum To round off our day of learning and experiencing something new, we headed to the Etihad Museum. Etihad in Arabic means 'United', which made me chuckle as it means Manchester City play in a shirt with 'United' written right across the front - how ironic. The futuristic museum Anyways, to the museum. The museum is underground, with a huge futuristic glass atrium on top. It is effectively paying homage to the 7 leaders of the various Emirates who came together in the 1970s, post the British colonial powers withdrawing from the area, to form one country. The same 7 Emirates still exist today, all with their own leaders - though unified with the ruler of Abu Dhabi as the main leader of the UAE. The museum was unsurprisingly very positive about its leaders and it felt a bit like a shrine, though we did learn quite a bit we hadn't previously appreciated about this region's rich and complex history. And inside Optional: Deira and Dubai Gold Souk If the mosque tour or museum aren't for you in Day 2's itinerary, then make sure that instead you cross Dubai Creek to visit Deira and the Gold Souk, as it's another beautiful historic area in the city. We'd planned to include this, and hop on a traditional Abra boat to cross the Creek to the gold souk but we actually ran out of time (not helped by my husband damaging his foot the day before so we were on a slow to hobbling pace). Dubai Gold Souk (courtesy of Traveladdicts. Com as we didn't manage to visit) Have a little longer? If you have longer in Dubai, there are lots of other amazing things to do, and you could easily spend another few days in the city exploring. Dubai Miracle Garden Full Post: HERE Dubai Miracle Garden is true madness. Open only during winter, it's an amazing flower attraction, including everything from Disney castles to aeroplanes to Smurf villages. A visit will take around 2 - 3 hours. Exploring the gardens Pretty installations Aya Universe Full Post: HERE Another unique Dubai experience is to visit Aya, an interactive light art installation which is a bit mind bogglingly fun. Enjoying Aya In the exhibition Dubai Desert Dubai is a city literally built in the middle of the desert, and only a short 30-45 minutes drive out will find you amongst the sand dunes. We had a desert evening meal one night to watch the sunset and it was really beautiful. You could also go dune buggying, camel riding or sand boarding - take your pick! Dinner set up in the desert Getting around in Dubai Dubai is not a walkable city. Google maps might say 1.4km but it's normally along a 6 way highway. The roads and traffic are busy and I really don't recommend walking anywhere unless places are literally next door. The main attractions (e. G. Mall, Historic District, Miracle Garden, Jumeirah Beach etc) are nowhere near each other (like 40 minute drives in some cases), so you will be dependent on transport. There is a metro but it runs to limited stops, though the Mall is one (assuming your hotel is anywhere near). Unfortunately it means taxis are the way forward in Dubai - we used Uber during our stay with no issues. They are fairly good value, safe and reliable here. More Dubai sites Where to stay in Dubai? We stayed in the absolutely amazing Shangri-La Dubai. It was a full on dose of mega-metropolis sensory overload with everything on offer from Vietnamese Brunch to floating breakfasts and epic rooftop views across the city. The Shangri-La pool and terrace (on my birthday) If you want something more traditional, Al Seef Heritage Hotel looks amazing. If you're all about the beach you might prefer to base yourself at Jumeirah in a hotel like the Mandarin Oriental, and if you want ultimate bragging rights for the most luxurious postcode in town you could stay on The Palm Jumeirah and splash on somewhere like Atlantis The Palm (you could even get your own underwater suite in an aquarium for a mere £5k a night -ha!). Finally, if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of the city completely, you could stay in the Dubai Desert - the epitome of luxury is Al Maha, or you could go for the (only slightly) less pricy option Bab Al Shams. So, what do you think of Dubai? Thanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed it - stay safe and happy travelling! Share this: Twitter Facebook More Email Pinterest WhatsApp Like Loading...

I really do want to go and see its incredible modernity, especially that it's transformed tremendously over the past few decades (before, it was all desert)! However, I hesitate to, as the UAE and Qatar have a history of human rights issue, e. G. workers exploitation from third-world countries, so I don't know if I'll head there anytime soon. We'll have to see! Thanks for sharing your adventures there, Han- it looks like a fun time!"}]}

Having spent my childhood in India, Dubai was always that mesmerizing oasis just a hop away. Its transformation from a desert to the futuristic metropolis has fascinated me ever since. And my first visit did not disappoint! Over the years, I've been fortunate enough to have visited Dubai multiple times, each experience more luxurious and memorable than the last.

Honestly, Dubai is one of the best places to visit in the world! I'll guide you through the must-see sights and and logistics like where to stay, how to get around to make your trip unforgettable. This is the perfect Dubai itinerary for first time visitors. Let's dive into how to spend three incredible days in Dubai! Download our FREE Travel Checklist & Planner Table of Contents Toggle 3 DAYS IN DUBAI ITINERARY DAY 1 (Downtown Dubai, Burj Khalifa & Dubai Mall) Let's start Day 1 at the crown jewel of Dubai - Burj Khalifa and the incredible Dubai Mall in Downtown. If it is your first time, I highly recommend staying in Dubai Downtown area as it is close to major attractions and makes it super easy to access Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall. Palace Downtown is my favorite hotel to stay here. It is luxurious with traditional Middle-Eastern decor and their service is impeccable. The staff service is incredible and they were so generous during our visit and gladly served lemon ginger tea at odd hours as we were sick during our visit. Morning: Breakfast at Palace Downtown with Burj Khalifa Views Begin your first day with a delicious breakfast at Ewaan in Palace Downtown hotel. This hotel has one of the most incredible breakfast spreads I've ever seen. They serves a delicious mix of Middle Eastern dishes from pistachio croissants, scrumptious date spread as well as continental, Indian, Asian breakfast options. Be sure to enjoy the breakfast with unbeatable views of the Burj Khalifa from the terrace. Head to the observation deck of Burj Khalifa After breakfast, head to the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, standing at 828 meters (2,717 feet). While I prefer the breathtaking views of the Burj from other vantage points, I highly recommend touring the Burj Khalifa. It is not everyday that you get to visit the world's tallest building and take the evelator that goes 10m/sec! The Burj Khalifa's At the Top observation decks on the 124th and 125th floors provide jaw-dropping panoramic views of Dubai skyline, the Arabian Gulf, and the surrounding desert. You can buy the tickets here. Option to Go Higher: For an even more luxurious experience, you can upgrade to At the Top Sky on the 148th floor, which is the highest observation deck in the world at 555 meters (1,821 feet). The 148th floor is a 90-minute experience and provides exclusive lounge access. I love architecture and learning about the incredible achievements to make this building possible so here are a few fun facts about the Burj Khalifa: Burj Khalifa has 163 floors and took six years to complete, opening to the public in 2010. The elevator to the observation deck is among the fastest in the world, reaching speeds of 10 meters per second. The Burj's design was inspired by traditional Islamic architecture and the shape of a desert flower. The most mind blowing fact for me is that the Burj can sway as much as 2 meters at its tallest point! Lunch and a stroll at Souk Al Bahar Walk over to Souk Al Bahar, a charming Arabian-style market just across a bridge from the Dubai Mall. This traditional shopping complex offers a unique blend of Middle Eastern crafts, jewelry, perfumes, and souvenirs. It is one of my favorite spots to take Instagram worthy photos in Dubai. The architecture is so beautiful and very traditional. Stop for lunch at one of the many options in Souk Al Bahar with views of Burj Khalifa My favorite restaurants are Asado: Asado is an upscale Argentinian steakhouse with Arabic-inspired decor. Abd el Wahab: My favorite high-end Lebanese restaurant offers incredible views of the Burj Khalifa and Dubai Fountain, with a menu of traditional Lebanese favorites. Serafina Dubai: Italian restaurant in Souk Al Bahar with an open terrace and unobstructed views of the Burj. Powered by GetYourGuide Afternoon: Dubai Mall and Dubai Aquarium Even in the winter months, Dubai is hot and humid. In order to avoid the afternoon heat, I highly recommend staying indoors exploring the mall or museums. You can't go to Dubai and not shop at the largest shopping mall in the world ! Dubai Mall is the right place for some retail therapy. From ultra high end luxury to daily fashion, Dubai Mall has the best selection of over 200 stores. You can take advantage of the VAT refund and shop luxury brands here. One of the highlights within Dubai Mall is the Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo. Stroll through the immersive tunnel where sharks, rays, and other sea creatures swim overhead. While it a must-visit, I felt it to be a tad expensive for an aquarium. I did visit anyway because my toddler loves visiting aquariums. We went at 10am to avoid the crowds and it was worth it. Dubai Mall is also home to an amusement park, ice skating rink as well as gaming rooms if you are into them. Also don't miss Arabica Coffee in Dubai Mall. It is one of the most Instagrammable cafes in Dubai. Evening: Dubai Fountain Show and Dinner with Fountain Views One of my favorite things to do in the evening in Dubai is to watch the Dubai Fountain show, one of the most mesmerizing shows in the city! The fountains dance to a mix of classical, Arabic, and pop tunes, with a light show in the water against the backdrop of the Burj Khalifa. The Dubai Fountain Show is free to watch and can be viewed from many vantage points around from the Dubai Mall, Souq Al Bahar and Palace Downtown. However, my favorite way to watch the show while avoiding the crowds is by booking an abra boat ride and view the show with unobstructed views all around. Boats depart regularly from the Dubai Fountain Promenade near the Dubai Mall's waterfront exit. Don't miss this activity especially if you have little ones. Cap off your day with dinner at a restaurant overlooking the fountains. Here are some excellent choices: Thiptara: Located in the Palace Downtown, Thiptara serves Thai cuisine with a prime view of the fountain. Social House: With trendy atmosphere and diverse menu, Social House is a fantastic spot to enjoy the fountain show. Zeta Seventy Seven: Situated on the rooftop, this chic restaurant offers contemporary Asian dishes with spectacular views of the Dubai Fountain. DAY 2 (Old Dubai, Souks And Sunset Dunes Desert Tour) Day 2 in Dubai is all about exploring Old Dubai and its traditions. This is perhaps how Dubai would have been had oil not been discovered. Even though I love the comfort of luxury, I also love learning about the history of the places I visit. I make a point to learn about the historic origins and old way of living. And Dubai's history is surely fascinating. It is one of the reasons why I found Bur Dubai (especially Al Fahidi historical neighborhood, Al Seef) endlessly fascinating, from the unique architecture of traditional wind towers (designed to cool buildings naturally in Dubai's heat) to the trade legacy of the district. It was incredible to learn about how the story of Dubai's roots as a modest fishing and pearl-diving community to its emergence as a modern marvel. Morning in Al Fahidi District and Al Seef Start with a leisurely walk through Al Seef's waterfront promenade, where you'll find charming artisan shops, heritage displays and even a unique Starbucks housed in a traditional building. While the area is touristy, I recommend browsing the endless display of shops with traditional lamps, lights and artisanal crafts. Walk around the historic Al Fahidi District, also known as Bastakiya. Established in the late 19th century by Persian merchants, Al Fahidi is one of Dubai's oldest neighborhoods, with narrow lanes, wind towers, and mud-brick buildings. Bastakiya is filled with art galleries, museums, and cultural centers dedicated to preserving Dubai's heritage. If you love museums, check out the Dubai Museum, located in the 200-year-old Al Fahidi Fort. It shows a glimpse of the desert life and early Bedouin settlementsof Dubai. This part of the city feels like a world away from the towering skyscrapers of Downtown Dubai. Early lunch at Arabian Tea House Arabian Tea House is steps away from Dubai Museum and a great place to stop for lunch. For an authentic taste of Emirati cuisine, a visit to this cafe is a must. Did I mention that it is also one of the most Instagrammable cafes in Dubai ? This popular spot has a beautiful garden and courtyard with blue benches, white canopies, and flowering plants, making it a perfect backdrop for photoshoot or Instagram. The food and drinks are delicious as well. My favorites are traditional Arabic tea (lightly sweetened and infused with mint), the Mezze platter and Machboos. To visit traditional souks or markets, check out nearby Deira Grand Souk or the Gold Souk just across the Dubai Creek. It is a one of a kind place with gold ornaments of all kinds including vests made of gold. If you have more days to spare, I suggest spending a day here exploring the shops, taking the Dhow cruise or abra boat along Dubai Creek. Powered by GetYourGuide Evening Red Dunes Sunset Tour and BBQ dinner End your second day with a desert safari tour. An evening desert safari is the best option. Your 3 days in Dubai will not be complete without spending time in the desert. If you love the desert vibes and would like a unique experience, I highly recommend an unforgettable adventure involving sunset photography in the red dunes, camel rides and a traditional dinner along with stargazing at a Bedouin camp. If you prefer a more thrilling experience, you can include a safari along with dune bashing in a 4 but we chose the former as it is kid friendly. The dinner under the stars was an incredible experience. The camp serves a wide spread of Middle Eastern and barbecue dishes, including kebabs, hummus, falafel, and traditional bread. An added bonus is live performances including belly dancing and music, my daughter's favorite! :) Download our FREE Travel Checklist & Planner DAY 3 (Beach day, Dubai Marina and Palm Jumeirah) Powered by GetYourGuide Morning beach time and Dubai Marina A beach day with turquoise waters, soft sands is a must on your Dubai trip itinerary. Start your day at JBR beach located at The Walk at JBR (Jumeirah Beach Residence). Enjoy beach activities, or rent a sunbed and unwind while taking in views of the iconic Ain Dubai Ferris wheel on Bluewaters Island. Choose from a variety of beachfront cafes and restaurants along The Walk at JBR. This is a popular area for expats. Alternatively, Jumeirah Beach is quieter, more peaceful with great views of the Burj Al Arab. After some time at JBR Beach, exploreDubai Marina, a bustling waterfront district known for its skyscrapers and luxury yachts. Stroll along theDubai Marina Walk, a 7-kilometer path lined with chic cafes, boutiques, and restaurants. Enjoy lunch at one of the many incredible restaurants in Dubai Marina with great views of the Marina. Palm Jumeirah and The Atlantis Palm Jumeirah, a man-made island shaped like a palm tree is another architectural marvel of Dubai. It is home to luxury hotels, fine dining, and popular attractions, making it a must-see for first-time visitors. Fun fact: Palm Jumeirah is one of the most expensive parts of Dubai and home to the famous billionaires row! To catch a panoramic view of Palm Jumeirah and Dubai's skyline, head to The View at The Palm, located in the Palm Tower. An alternative to this is a helicopter tour or sky diving for something more adventurous! One of these adventures is a must add to your Dubai travel itinerary if you 'd like to get a bird's eye view of Dubai! Don't forget to stop by Atlantis, The Palm, located at the tip of the Palm. Check out The Lost Chambers Aquarium, a beautifully designed underwater world featuring over 65,000 marine animals. If you love water sports and theme parks, you could easily spend a day in Aquaventure waterpark. We did not use the water park here, but we did visit the Bahamas one and have a full travel guide to Atlantis Bahamas. Where To Stay And Best Hotels In Dubai Where to stay in Dubai is a big topic as Dubai is quite big and the area you stay in matters for accessibility. Choosing the best location can make or break your trip! Downtown Dubai: If this is your first visit to Dubai, I highly recommend staying in Downtown Dubai for iconic views. It is closest to the most popular attractions like the Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall. And there is none better than Palace Downtown hotel to level up your stay! Book your stay In Dubai Dubai Marina and Jumeirah: If you prefer a more laid back vibe with beaches, upscale amenities, I recommend staying in Dubai Marina and Jumeirah area. This area is home to several resorts with sea views, private beaches, and access to dining and vibrant nightlife. Madinat Jumeirah hotels, Le Meridien Royal Beach Resort and JW Marriott Dubai Marina are good options to stay here. Old Dubai: For a completely opposite experience to the modern charm of the other two areas, stay in Old Dubai encompassing Al Fahidi, Al Seef and Deira. This area is a mix of heritage sites, charming souks, and cultural attractions. Al Seef Heritage Hotel Dubai and XVA Art Hotel are two great options to stay here. For full information, check out my detailed post on where to stay in Dubai and best hotels. Book your stay In Dubai Dubai Itinerary: Travel Tips and FAQs Is 3 days enough to visit Dubai? 3 days is enough to visit the most iconic sights and get a taste of Dubai. Dubai is huge with many things to do in the city as well as day trips. If you have 5 days in Dubai or more, you can visit more attractions and places like the Mall of the Emirates, Jumeirah Mosque, IMG Worlds of Adventure (world's largest indoor theme park), the Global Village, Miracle Garden, I recommend 5 days or even a week. If you would like to take short day trip to Abu Dhabi or other cities in the United Arab Emirates, 5 days would be ideal. Best time to visit Dubai? November - March is the best time to visit Dubai and its high season. Be sure to plan your trip early. The weather is pleasant and temperatures range from 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F). The summer months are too hot with temperatures soaring above 40°C. How to get around Dubai? Public transport in Dubai is quite accessible with metro stations at most major attractions. If you prefer the comfort of taxi, Uber is the best way. Is Dubai safe for tourists? Yes, Dubai is considered one of the safest cities in the world for tourists. The crime rate is very low and we have never felt unsafe. What to wear in Dubai? Dubai is relatively liberal compared to other cities in the Middle East, but be respectful and dress modestly in public areas. In religious places, women should cover shoulders and wear dresses that cover the knees and men should avoid sleeveless shirts and shorts. Swimwear is acceptable at pools and beaches, but it's best to cover up when leaving those areas. I wore dresses and sleeveless tops in Downtown and felt totally fine. How far are the main attractions from Dubai airport? Downtown Dubai is 15Kms away and takes about 20 - 30min from Dubai International Airport. Dubai Marina and Jumeirah areas are about 30Kms away and take 30-40min depending on the traffic. Is Alcohol prohibited in Dubai? Alcohol is available at licensed bars, restaurants, and hotels. Drinking alcohol in public places is strictly prohibited. Tourists can buy alcohol at the duty free shops in the airport but I recommend ordering drinks at bars or restaurants. And don't get inebriated! The hotels we stayed in didn't have any alcohol in the mini bar. And I did not drink anywhere except for an ocassional drink in restaurants. Are there any cultural customs I should be aware of? Dubai is a multicultural city but follows certain cultural customs rooted in Islamic tradition. Public displays of affection should be kept minimal, especially in public areas, and it is respectful to dress modestly. During Ramadan, eating, drinking, or smoking in public is discouraged during daylight hours as a sign of respect. FINAL THOUGHTS Dubai is a city I find myself returning to time and again. Its ever-evolving skyline, history, cultural sites, and endless new attractions ensure there's always something fresh and exciting to discover. In three days, you will get a taste of what Dubai has to offer. From the breathtaking heights of the Burj Khalifa and the luxurious ambiance of Dubai Mall in Downtown to the historic charm of Al Fahidi, theme parks and the crystal clear beaches of Jumeirah, Dubai has something to offer for everyone. In my view, Dubai offers diverse experiences unlike any other big city. This three day Dubai itinerary provides a perfect introduction to this bustling city, leaving you with plenty of reasons to come back and explore even more."}]}

This is the information you need to ensure your Dubai trip runs smoothly. How many days in Dubai? First questions first, how many days do you actually need in Dubai? Being a city, many travellers think Dubai doesn't need that long to be discovered, but they couldn't be more wrong! The city is huge, and transfers between places can take their time. Personally, I think the bare minimum amount of time you should spend in Dubai is three days. Some travellers try to see as much as possible during long layovers in Dubai, but that's nowhere near enough time. This will allow you to see all the main sights, have time to relax on the beach and properly get a feel for the unique vibe of this city. The iconic pink Atlantis The Palm as seen from The Pointe, Dubai If you want to go beyond the main tourist attractions of Dubai, and live unique experiences like spending a night in the desert or seeing the Presidential Palace of Abu Dhabi, then you will need longer in Dubai. In this article I have outlined my core Dubai 3-day itinerary, and then built on top of that to form itineraries for four days, five days, six days and even seven days in Dubai. Depending on how long you have, and your personal interests, you can expand your trip to the full Dubai 7-day itinerary, or maybe just pick and choose specific days to form a Dubai 5-day itinerary. Although three days is enough, if you have the time for a Dubai 7-day itinerary, that is what I would personally go for, as it will allow you to really see everything this unique city, and its surroundings, have to offer. The entrance of Palace Hotel and Burj Khalifa in Dubai How to get around Dubai Dubai is a huge city, and making your way around it can be complicated, but don't let that deter you. Between public transport and taxis, you can easily make your way around Dubai. Dubai has an efficient metro system, the Dubai Metro. It runs mostly parallel to the sea and Sheikh Zayed Road. It's a rapid transit rail network that does 53 stops and covers most of the main areas of Dubai. Fares for the Dubai Metro depend on how far you're travelling. You can purchase tickets at every metro station, get daily passes or get a Nol card to top up. It's perfect for getting to the main spots (for example the malls have entrances directly connected to the Metro system, so you don't have to walk outside in the heat), but if you're trying to go smaller side streets, walking from the Metro station can be annoying. For short distances, or for journeys to places that aren't on the Metro line, I recommend either an Uber or taxi. I was surprised to find that taxis in Dubai are comparatively cheap (a 20km journey is around 50 AED). Discovering Al Seef, the historical area of Dubai Best time to visit Dubai Dubai is a very popular winter sun destination. Being located in the middle of the desert, Dubai has a hot and dry climate all year round. In winter that means temperatures around 20-25°C, but in summer it can go up to over 40°C.

Enjoying the pool with view over the Museum of the Future at 25hours Hotel One Central in Dubai Best tours in Dubai If you follow the advice in this Dubai itinerary, you'll easily be able to discover Dubai independently without having to join a tour. Having said that, there are definitely some experiences worth splurging for, or entrance tickets to certain attractions that you have to book online beforehand. I have listed the most popular below. Helicopter Flight from The Palm to Burj Khalifa - The tour name is pretty self explanatory, if you want a truly adrenaline inducing and unique experience, this is it! See the iconic Dubai skyline from the sky! Dubai Old Town, Souks & Street Food Guided Tour - Discover the historical parts of Dubai with a knowledgeable local guide, from the souks to the street food, you won't be disappointed.

The iconic red dunes of Dubai desert The exterior of Qasr Al-Watan in Abu Dhabi Do you need travel insurance for Dubai? After my personal experience spending two nights in a private hospital in Tenerife, and having to pay for it out of pocket (it wasn't cheap), I always recommend getting travel insurance. You might not end up needing it, but for a small fee you can travel without worries. Personally, I suggest getting your travel insurance with Heymondo. Heymondo offers tailor made travel insurance, providing the best value for money for your specific trip. You can also buy it once you're already abroad and have forgotten about it before flying (which, if you're anything like me, is quite likely). Besides the usual cancellation, medical expenses, luggage coverage and general travel insurance services, Heymondo also has a 24/7 doctor chat and instant assistance through their app. As a Greta's Travels reader, you get 5% off your Heymondo travel insurance !

Exploring the Spice Souk of Dubai What to pack for Dubai When planning what to pack for Dubai you'll soon realise it's not as simple as the usual travel essentials. Being a Muslim country, you will have to dress more conservatively in certain occasions. However, Dubai is famous for its malls, so if you do realise you're missing something, you can just buy it once there! That said, here are the things I would make sure to pack. Head scarf for women - If you plan on visiting the Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi (which you really should be) then you have to remember to bring a scarf to cover your hair. You won't be allowed in without one. Modest clothing that fully covers you - This goes for both men and women. Dress codes in Dubai vary depending on the situations, but it's good to have some long loose trousers and breathable long sleeved shirts, so as to comply with the dress code but also not overheat in the hot Emirati weather! The Wings of Mexico statue in Downtown Dubai Camera - Given how beautiful Dubai is, you want to make sure you capture it in all its beauty! Reusable water bottle - Especially if you plan to do a lot of walking, bring a bottle you can refill and ensure you stay hydrated. It will save you money and you'll also waste less plastic, it's a win-win! Power bank - Whether it's while snapping some pictures, while google mapping your way around the city or ordering an uber, you don't want your phone to run out of battery during a crucial moment! International adapter - In Dubai you'll find type G sockets and plugs (like the UK ones). Depending on where you're from, you might need an adapter to charge your electronics. The famous Palm of Dubai at sunset Dubai itinerary 3 days Let's start with my core Dubai 3-day itinerary! If you can't stay long in Dubai, make sure to stay at least three days, and hit all the highlights I've outlined below. Dubai itinerary day 1 - Dubai Marina Morning - Discover Dubai Marina I couldn't start a Dubai itinerary in any other location. Dubai Marina is one of the most iconic areas of Dubai. With its white sand beach, tall skyscrapers, fun beach clubs, and countless dining and drinking opportunities, it's what everyone imagines when they think of Dubai. I recommend wandering around Dubai Marina in the morning, before it gets too hot. You can walk along the man-made marina, enjoying the views of traditional dhow boats and modern yachts cruising past, with the iconic Dubai skyscrapers as backdrop. Walking along Dubai Marina There are plenty of cafes, restaurants and shops where you can stop for a quick breakfast, and maybe a bit of shopping throughout the morning. From the food court of Dubai Marina Mall you will get an incredible view over Dubai Marina, and the best part, it's completely free! As the morning turns into afternoon and the day grows hotter, you can head to the beach to cool down! If you want to try some truly unique experiences, I have listed some popular tours below. Dubai Marina Yacht Tour with Breakfast or BBQ - This is perfect for a group of friends or a special occasion, as you'll get to cruise past the iconic Dubai Marina skyline on a luxury yacht! Helicopter Flight from The Palm to Burj Khalifa - The tour name is pretty self explanatory, if you want a truly adrenaline inducing and unique experience, this is it! See the iconic Dubai skyline from the sky! Iconic views of Dubai Marina Afternoon - Relax at JBR & Marina Beach Just beyond the skyscrapers of Dubai Marina, you will find JBR Beach and Marina Beach waiting for you. Being the first day in Dubai, I imagine you will also want to relax after your flight, and what better place to do so? Here you will find both private beach clubs, as well as public stretches of beach. If you plan to stay here a while, I definitely recommend investing in a sun bed and umbrella, as the beaches in Dubai can get very hot! There are also plenty of bars, restaurants and cafes on the seaside walk behind the beach, so you don't need to worry about going hungry or thirsty while you're at the beach. A traditional wooden dhow boat in Dubai Marina JBR & Dubai Marina as seen from The View at The Palm If you're travelling with children, you'll find plenty of fun activities at JBR and Marina Beach also for them. From inflatable slides to banana boat tours, or from camel rides to jet skis, these beaches offer plenty of activities. You could just lie there and tan all afternoon, but if you're afraid of getting bored, no need to worry as there's plenty to do! You could also cross the bridge to Bluewaters, a man-made island with loads of bars, restaurants and shops, as well as the new wheel and viewpoint of Dubai; Ain Dubai. I love Bluewaters also because it offers a great view of the Dubai Marina skyline. Enjoying the view over Dubai Marina & JBR at sunset from Bluewaters Dinner - Dhow Dinner Cruise in Dubai Marina After a quick stop at your hotel to wash off the salt and sand, it's time to get all dressed up and head back to Dubai Marina, for a traditional dhow cruise and dinner. I went on a dhow cruise and dinner in Dubai Marina on my last trip to Dubai, and I don't know why I waited six trips to finally do so! Dhows are the traditional wooden boats of the UAE. Today, they are mostly used for tourist cruises, especially for dinner or afternoon tea. Doing a dhow dinner cruise in Dubai Marina is obviously a very touristy activity, but like I always say, touristy things are popular for a reason. Wooden dhow boats cruising in Dubai Marina The top deck of our Dubai dhow cruise, where you will enjoy your dinner You can't travel to Rome and skip the Colosseum just because it's \"touristy\". It's a must on every travel bucket list, and rightly so. The same goes for dhow dinner cruises in Dubai. Seeing the skyline of Dubai lit up for the night, while cruising along the sea and eating delicious local food, is an experience like no other. Most dhow cruises will include also pick-up and drop-off from your hotel, so you don't have to worry about transfers. Click here to book your dhow dinner cruise in Dubai! Or check out prices & availability below! Enjoying the view over Bluewaters Island and Ain Dubai from the top deck of our dhow cruise Dubai itinerary day 2 - Old Dubai Meets Modern Morning - Discover old Dubai After the skyscrapers of Dubai Marina, get ready to discover an older and more traditional side of Dubai. This morning we will head to Deira and Al Fahidi, the older areas of Dubai, which are also home to the souks. In Deira you will find the Gold Souk and Spice Souk, two of the most iconic souks of Dubai. The sprawling souks are characterised by countless winding alleys, lined with all sorts of shops. As the names suggest, you can expect to find jewellery and spices, but there are also many shops in the souks selling souvenirs, clothing, fine silks and more. It's the perfect place to go for a wander, and discover a less known side of Dubai. Exploring the souqs of Dubai, close to Deira Some of the gold shops in the gold souk in Dubai Just across the creek (which you can cross in a traditional abra wooden boat for around 1 AED) you will find Bur Dubai. This is another area with souks and shops, where you can find everything from clothing to souvenirs. As you walk through the souks you will emerge next to Al Fahidi, the historical district of Dubai. There are less shops present here, but you can spend a bit of time wandering around the traditional streets, and getting a feel for what old Dubai was like. Crossing the Creek of Dubai in a traditional Abra wooden boat Discovering the streets of Al Fahidi historical district in Dubai In Al Fahidi we had lunch at Arabian Tea House Restaurant & Cafe. It's a lovely traditional restaurant, with a beautiful interior decor and delicious dishes like fattoush, falafel or meat wraps, and main dishes like Biryani. Before leaving the magical atmosphere of old Dubai, you can pop by Al Seef, another historical area of Dubai. It's very similar to Al Fahidi, so if you're short on time, you don't necessarily have to visit both. Dubai is a super safe city, but if you don't feel like wandering around the souks alone, then you can join a guided tour like this one. Discover the souks, old town, creek and even some delicious local street food with this guided tour! Click here to book your Dubai Old Town, Souks & Street Food tour, or check out prices &availability in the calendar below! The gorgeous exterior of Arabian Tea House in Al Fahidi historical district in Dubai Afternoon - Sky Views Observatory & Dubai Mall After your morning exploring old Dubai, it's time to head to some of the most modern and unique sights in Dubai. Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall! Located in Address Sky View (accessible from the Dubai Mall metro station), you will find Sky Views Observatory, the latest viewpoint in Dubai. Entrance costs around 20 EUR per person, I recommend purchasing it online beforehand so you don't have to queue once there. From Sky Views you get an epic view of Burj Khalifa, as well as the surrounding cityscapes of Dubai. But what makes this viewpoint special, is the glass slide, the glass walkway and the Sky Edge Walk. This isn't just a place where you go and look at a view, you can truly engage with it in unique and adrenaline pumping ways. It's not every day that you get to hang off the side of a 53-floor building! Click here to purchase your Sky Views Skip-the-Line Entry Ticket, or check out prices &availability below! Sliding down the glass slide of Sky Views Observatory in Dubai Once you've had your epic views and adrenaline fix, you can go for a wander inside Dubai Mall. Dubai Mall is the second largest mall in the world, home to over 1,200 retail stores. Whatever it is you're searching for, I'm pretty sure you'll find it here. It's even home to Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo! Just outside Dubai Mall you'll find the Burj Khalifa water fountains. You actually get the best view of the fountains from the Apple Store inside Dubai Mall! The fountains are on every 30 minutes from 6PM to 11PM, every day of the week, although it can vary depending on the time of the year or if there are public holidays on. I was last in Dubai during Ramadan, and then fountain show started later than usual. Time your sightseeing, viewpoint admiring and shopping so as to arrive at the fountains in time for one of the shows! Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo, inside Dubai Mall The ice skating rink inside Dubai Mall Sunset & Evening - Burj Khalifa After enjoying the Burj Khalifa fountain show, head over to Burj Khalifa (the entrance is inside Dubai Mall). With its 828 metres, Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world, wanting to admire the view from its top is only natural! Seeing the view from the top of Burj Khalifa is one of the most popular things to do in Dubai, and as such, it can get incredibly busy. I've been twice before on separate Dubai trips, and have a few pointers to ensure you have the best visit possible. Enjoying the view over Dubai at night from the Burj Khalifa If you can, I 100% recommend splurging on one of the premium experiences like the skip-the-line ticket, visiting floor 148 or the ticket with lunch or dinner at the Burj Club. The normal ticket with entrance to floors 124 and 125 is what everyone does, and the queue gets gigantic. On my last trip, we had to queue for over an hour just to get to the lift! We spent a few hours enjoying the view and taking photos, and then had to queue a good 30 minutes to get back down. The premium skip-the-line tickets will avoid you this hassle.The best time to go to the top of Burj Khalifa is at sunset, as you can see the whole change in the colours of the sky and Dubai skyline. The view over Dubai at night from Burj Khalifa Standing at 452m (the height of floor 124), watching the sky turn pink and then dark, and the skyscrapers of Dubai light up below you is a unique experience. Even if you purchase a skip-the-line entrance, it can take a while to get to the viewing platform, so make sure to time your visit accordingly and don't miss the sunset! Dubai Burj Khalifa Level 124 & 125 Entry Ticket - This is the basic entrance ticket to Burj Khalifa. With this you can go up to the viewing platform, and enjoy the stunning views. Burj Khalifa Ticket & Tour: Level 124, 125 & 148 - Here you'll find the skip-the-line entrance, as well as access to the higher viewing deck at level 148, and a guided tour experience to top it all off! Burj Khalifa 124 & Lunch or Dinner at The Burj Club - The premium experience, which goes beyond the viewing deck and includes a delicious meal! Enjoying the view over Dubai at night from the top of Burj Khalifa After spending some time enjoying the view, if you don't go for the Burj Khalifa entrance with dinner, you can head back down and eat at Dubai Mall. We ate at Al Hallab, a tasty Lebanese restaurant with outdoor seating and a view of the Burj Khalifa fountains. The Burj Khalifa and Fountain Show as seen from the Al Hallab outdoor terrace Day 3 - Barasti Beach & The Palm Morning - Mall of the Emirates When it comes to malls, there are countless malls in Dubai that you could visit. Having visited Dubai Mall already, I think the next one that can't miss on any Dubai itinerary is Mall of the Emirates. Mall of the Emirates is famous for being home to Ski Dubai; an indoor ski resort. You read that right, you could be baking under the hot desert sun one day, and then skiing at -1°C the next on the same trip! Besides skiing, you can spend some time shopping, chilling and eating at one of the many food court restaurants. Ski Dubai; the indoor ski resort inside Mall of the Emirates, Dubai Afternoon - Barasti Beach Once you've made the most of your shopping spree, it's time to head to Barasti Beach! Located between Dubai Marina and The Palm, Barasti Beach is one of the most iconic beach bars in Dubai. My personal favourite thing about it is that entry and use of the sun beds and umbrellas is free (unlike most beach bars in Dubai which charge 30+ EUR for the day). They will check your bag on arrival as you're not allowed to bring any food or drinks inside. Chilling at Barasti Beach in Dubai You don't have to pay for sun beds, but if you plan on spending a whole afternoon or day there, they count on you probably spending something on food and drinks. These can be a bit pricey, but when compared to average prices in Dubai, are actually pretty reasonable. Barasti Beach has a really cool vibe, with hammocks hanging just over the water, a pool, a stage for live music and a wide array of food and drink choices. Plus, it's lined by the iconic view of Dubai Marina skyscrapers behind it. Enjoying a drink at Barasti Beach Club in Dubai Sunset - The view at The Palm at sunset Once you've had your fill of sea and sunshine, head over to Palm Jumeirah for one of the best sunset views you'll have ever seen. That might seem hard to top after Burj Khalifa yesterday, but in my opinion, The View at The Palm is more fascinating. Palm Jumeirah is a palm-shaped artificial group of islands built just off the coast of Dubai. It's one of the most incredible engineering feats you will ever see, and it's unique in its kind. You hear a lot of talk about The Palm, but rarely have a chance to see it properly. View over the Dubai Marina & JBR skyline from The View at The Palm The sunset from The View at The Palm in Dubai The View at The Palm is located on the 52nd floor above The Palm, and offers 360 views over, you've guessed it, The Palm, as well as the Dubai Marina skyline, Burj Al Arab and even Burj Khalifa in the distance. Entrance ranges from 100-160 AED depending on if its prime hours or not. I recommend visiting at sunset, even though the price tag is higher as its at prime hours, it will honestly be worth the extra money. Watching the sun sink towards the ocean, pain the sky orange and turn golden as The Palm and Dubai skyline light up, was honestly one of the highlights of all my Dubai trips. It doesn't get as busy as Burj Khalifa, so you don't need to arrive too much earlier than your ticket entrance. Click here to purchase your entry ticket to The View at The Palm! Or check out prices & availability below! Enjoying the sunset from The View at The Palm in Dubai Evening - Dinner at The Pointe Since you're already at The Palm, once the sun goes down you can just head over to The Pointe, a new iconic waterfront destination with views of the famous Atlantis Hotel, lined with shops, bars and restaurants. Here you can walk the Palm Jumeirah Fountain Show, while eating at one of the many waterfront restaurants. It's a slightly off the beaten track, with less tourists compared to other malls or beach areas in Dubai. The Palm Fountain show as seen from The Pointe, with the famous Atlantis behind it Dubai itinerary 4 days As I already mentioned, three days is the bare minimum amount of time you need to spend in Dubai to enjoy it and see the sights. Now that you've seen the main sights, you can go beyond, and spend your fourth day in Dubai doing something unique. Desert safari With all the beaches, malls, glitz and glam of Dubai, you might have forgotten that you're actually in the middle of the desert. I didn't actually make it out to the desert until my third or fourth trip to Dubai, and I wish I'd made it sooner. Enjoying a camel ride in Dubai desert One of our cars got stuck in the Dubai desert while dune bashing On a desert safari you can go beyond the souks and historical neighbourhoods of Dubai, and get a feel for what bedouin desert life was truly like. There are loads of desert safaris in Dubai, mostly offering similar things, but also with unique twists or special selling points. Pretty much all safaris will include pick-up, drop-off, dune bashing, sand boarding, and a meal in the desert. Depending on whether you join a morning or afternoon tour, the meal will usually be a breakfast, lunch or dinner. I recommend joining an afternoon tour, since sunsets in the desert are absolutely magical! Beautiful sunset views in Dubai desert Spending a day away from the skyscrapers and beach clubs of Dubai is, in my opinion, a must on any Dubai itinerary. It gives you the opportunity to experience something truly unique, which you can't do just anywhere. Between the adrenaline pumping dune bashing, the endless golden dunes, the magical golden sunset and the distinctive local culture, you're guaranteed to spend a truly thrilling day. Dubai Red Dunes Safari, Camel Ride, BBQ & Al Marmoom Oasis - The most popular and complete desert safari out there, it includes all the fun desert activities, transfers and a BBQ dinner feast. From Dubai: Red Dunes and Camel Safari with Overnight Camp - Want to do something truly unique and spend a night in the desert? This is your opportunity to do so! The pool at Bedouin Oasis Camp - the camp for our Dubai desert safari The evening show during our desert safari Dubai itinerary 5 days Morning - Extend your desert safari If you have five days in Dubai, I highly recommend extending your desert safari and spending one night in the desert. If visiting the desert by day is magical, seeing it under the stars is even more so. Sleeping in a bedouin tent (or fancy desert resort, that's up to you) is a once in a lifetime experience. The overnight desert safaris will include both breakfast and dinner, and you can expect a traditional performance during dinner. After your magical night in the desert, you'll wake up feeling refreshed and energised. You can spend some time in the morning relaxing at your bedouin camp, and then get ready to head back to the city. Going on a camel ride in the desert in Dubai Afternoon - Chill at the Beach & see the Burj Al Arab Once you return to the city from your desert adventure, you can head back to the sea, and discover some new Dubai beaches you haven't yet visited. For example Kite Beach; a long stretch of fine white sand and turquoise water. This beach can get quite windy, which makes it perfect for kitesurfing and other water sports, hence the name. It's a fun beach to spend an afternoon, go for a dip, and maybe even try some kitesurfing! Nearby you'll also see the famous Burj Al Arab, the iconic sail-shaped luxury hotel in Dubai. Burj Al Arab and the iconic Dubai skyline as seen from The View at The Palm You can pop over to Public Beach (it doesn't seem to have a name, that's how it comes up on Google Maps) if you want to get a closer look. Just bear in mind that, as of April 2024, there was a construction site by the beach, which blocked the view of Burj Al Arab. I don't know at what stage the construction is now, or if it will be blocking the Burj Al Arab view permanently once completed. If you want to continue your local Emirati experience, you can head over to Bu Qtair Restaurant for dinner (located half way between Kite Beach & the Burj Al Arab). It's a very local and traditional fish restaurant, it's not fancy, but the fish is delicious! The iconic sail shape of Burj al Arab in Dubai Dubai itinerary 6 days If you can spend at least six days in Dubai, then for your final day I recommend actually getting out of Dubai, and exploring the Emirati capital; Abu Dhabi. Many travellers don't know whether to choose Dubai or Abu Dhabi for their trips, but if you can spend at least six days in Dubai, you won't have to! Just follow this Dubai itinerary and you'll be able to see both. Day trip to Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi is only a 1-hour drive away from Dubai, meaning you can easily do a day trip to Abu Dhabi from Dubai. One day isn't a lot, but it's enough to see all the main sights of Abu Dhabi, and get a feel for this unique city. Many travellers often wonder if they should visit Dubai or Abu Dhabi, and while the answer ultimately depends on your travel style and mood, I definitely think Dubai has more going for it, and you can just visit Abu Dhabi for a day or two. Exploring Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi You can easily visit Abu Dhabi independently, just rent a car or hop on a bus and head over! Alternatively, if you don't feel like driving in the UAE or figuring out public transport, there are many organised day tours you can join. I have listed the best ones below. From Dubai: Abu Dhabi Premium Full-Day Sightseeing Tour - The most complete Dubai to Abu Dhabi day trip, it includes all of the major sights, transfer and lunch. From Dubai: Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed Mosque Guided Tour - A shorter tour for those who only want to visit Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque. From Dubai: Abu Dhabi Full-Day Trip with Grand Mosque & Louvre - For the arts and culture lovers, this tour focuses on the Grand Mosque and Louvre Museum. The \"Power of Words\" piece inside Qasr Al-Watan in Abu Dhabi If you do choose to visit Abu Dhabi independently, I have outlined below the must-see sights that you can't miss. Emirates Heritage Club Emirates Heritage Club is a reconstruction of a traditional desert village. It's a cool place to wander around, but after the souks and historical areas of Dubai and the desert experience, it probably won't wow you. What is wow about Emirates Heritage Club is the view of the Abu Dhabi skyline. You'll be right across from Corniche Beach, and will be able to enjoy the views of this unique skyline. Enjoying the view over the Abu Dhabi Skyline Qasr al Watan The Presidential Palace was completed in 2017, but only opened to the public in 2019. Entrance is 60 AED, and trust me when I saw, it's well worth the price tag. Qasr al Watan is one of the most stunning buildings I've ever seen. The white granite facade only hints at the sumptuous interior, where you will find absolutely breath taking rooms and decorations. Walking through its halls, you understand what real grandeur is. The exterior of Qasr Al-Watan in Abu Dhabi The grand interior of Qasr Al-Watan in Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Completed in 2007, Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque (often referred to as just Grand Mosque) is one of the largest mosques in the world, and home to the largest hand-woven carpet in the world. It's an elaborate display of Islamic architecture and design.With its domes, columns, details and spires, this imposing white building will leave you breathless. Entrance if free, just make sure to register online for a specific time slot, and make sure to dress appropriately or you won't be allowed in. Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi Sunset from What AlKarama What AlKarama is a war memorial just across the road from the Grand Mosque. In and of itself it might not be a Abu Dhabi highlight, but what makes it special is the shallow pool in front of it, where you can see a perfect reflection of the Grand Mosque. It's especially stunning at sunset, when the mosque starts to light, the sky turns pink and the reflection is perfectly defined. Enjoying the view over Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque at sunset In my opinion, these are the four places you absolutely have to visit in Abu Dhabi. There are many other famous and popular sights, such as Ferrari World, The Louvre, Saadiyat Island and Emirates Palace, but seeing all of them in one day would be a bit of a stretch. After all, this is a Dubai itinerary, not an Abu Dhabi one. If you can extend your Dubai trip and spend a night in Abu Dhabi that would be a great opportunity to see more of this unique city. It also allows you to see the Abu Dhabi skyline lit for the night, which is quite the sight. If you just want to get a feel for the Abu Dhabi vibe, a day trip is more than enough, and you can head back to Dubai for the last day of your Dubai itinerary. The unique skyline of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi lit up for the night Dubai itinerary 7 days If you're lucky enough to spend seven days in Dubai, here is the final day of your Dubai 1-week itinerary! To be entirely honest, I don't have specific recommendations for this final day in Dubai. If you follow all my suggestions for the previous six days, by this point you'll have seen all the key highlights of Dubai and its surroundings. And let's be real, you'll probably also be a bit tired from all the sightseeing and travelling around. The \"fronds\" of the Palm at sunset, as seen from The View at The Palm The reason I suggest spending at least one week in Dubai, is because it gives you time to absorb everything you're seeing, without rushing too much. You could see everything in less (as I said already, three days in Dubai are the bare minimum to see it all) but you'll be knackered by the end of it. On this final day in Dubai you can head back to spots you particularly liked, maybe go back to Barasti Beach Club for some beach chilling, or head over to Dubai Mall for some final shopping. There are also plenty of other attractions in Dubai that I haven't mentioned yet. Like the famous water parks at Atlantis or Burj Al Arab, the pool club at The View at the Palm, seeing the sunset from Dubai Creek, the Museum of the Future, or exploring the new Blueswater water front. I haven't included them in my core Dubai travel itinerary because, even though they're all great, I don't think they're a core part of a Dubai trip. Depending on your personal interests, you can choose to visit one or more of them on this final day. The Museum of the Future in Dubai Final thoughts on the best Dubai holiday itinerary There you have it, the ultimate Dubai itinerary! Have you been to Dubai before? How did you find it? Let me know in the comments below! I know Dubai isn't for everyone, but there's no denying it's a unique place and there's nowhere else quite like it. I truly believe everyone should visit Dubai at least once in their life, and experience what all the buzz is about. With its huge malls, tall skyscrapers, glam lifestyle, fascinating desert and stunning sunsets, I know you'll love these Dubai itineraries. As I already mentioned, you need seven days in Dubai to see everything, but if that's too long for you, then three days in Dubai is the bare minimum. In this article I outlined day-by-day everything you should do and see in Dubai, building a Dubai itinerary for three days, four days, five days, six days and even seven days. Regardless of how long you have, one of these itineraries will fit your trip. I tried to include everything you need to know about planning your perfect Dubai itinerary, including the best activities, how to get around, where to stay, what to pack and more.

Since it is smack dab in the middle of the Arabain desert, the weather of Dubai can be quite harsh, making it hard to decide when in fact is the best time to visit. Dubai summers are oppressive, almost unbearable sometimes, and will often leave you trapped indoors. The best places to visit in Dubai in June, July and August will all have air conditioning and sometimes even artificial snow! Dubai's winter months are the most comfortable time of year and are comparable to summers elsewhere. Most of Dubai's landmarks will be very busy though as this is peak tourist season. Plan a visit to during Dubai's winter season but be ready to spend lots of cash. The best months to backpack Dubai are hands-down during the spring and autumn. Dubai's shoulder seasons are comfortable, not too hot, and not too busy with tourists. As such, these are the best times to visit Dubai's beaches. Dubai in May starts to heat up again so take note.

Luckily, getting around is super easy, thanks to its well-developed public transport network spread throughout all parts of the city. The metro is the most commonly used public transport in the city. It connects most neighborhoods and it's just two lines, so it's really easy to navigate and it's also the most cost-effective way to get around. They are clean, ultra-modern, and safe. Women can choose to use the women-only carts if they want to. Plus, it connect you all the way to Dubai International Airport. Another way to get around the city is by taxi. Uber and Careem are the common taxi service apps in Dubai. They are more expensive than a licensed taxi usually, but they offer a flat rate, which means if you get stuck in traffic you're not paying for it. As a rule of thumb, Careem is less expensive than Uber if you're travelling shorter distances and Uber is less expensive than Careem for longer distances. Finally, another way to get around Dubai is by taking the bus. There are a total of 1,518 buses in Dubai, running on 119 internal lines, including 35 lines connected to the metro stations. Buses are a cheap way of getting around, but they require a bit of searching to make sure you're on the right bus. As Dubai is so hot and it's no fun waiting around in the scorching heat for a bus, I recommend you get the metro and Ubers. Plus they are so cheap it makes perfect sense! Travel with peace of mind. Travel WITH a security belt. Stash your cash safely with this money belt. It will keep your valuables safely concealed, no matter where you go. It looks exactly like a normal belt except for a SECRET interior pocket perfectly designed to hide a wad of cash, a passport photocopy or anything else you may wish to hide. Never get caught with your pants down again! (Unless you want to...) Hide Yo' Money! What To Prepare Before Visiting Dubai Coming prepared is one of the most important parts of travelling, no matter where you want to go. Although Dubai is considered to be one of the safest cities in the United Arab Emirates. It is also known as one of the safest middle eastern destinations for women and travelers in general. However, it is still wise to take precautions and know the country you're visiting while traveling abroad. It is recommended that travelers who visit Dubai, especially women, dress fairly modestly in public, and bathing suits are only allowed on the beach and at hotel pools. While women are generally safe in Dubai, It is also a good idea to avoid situations that can place you in a more vulnerable position. If traveling alone, ask to be seated in the family section and try to sit in the women's section at the front of the train. There can also be unpredictable driving behavior in the United Arab Emirates, so keep an eye out for reckless driving. Pickpocketing is fairly rare in Dubai, but pay attention to your surroundings (as is always wise when traveling), especially around the tourist hub, Jumeirah Beach. While Dubai is fairly cosmopolitan in many ways, they remain highly conservative, so try to avoid PDA because if someone is offended by it, you can get charged/fined. It is also forbidden to eat in public during the daylight hours of Ramadan, however, most hotels provide a screen in their restaurants so foreign guests can eat during the day. Dubai is considered to be friendly and safe for the most part, but make sure you check out all the rules and tips for traveling there before you go. As you are likely traveling in a foreign country, ensure you have access to emergency numbers in case of an accident or problem. It's also always a good idea to have travel insurance in the event of a problem. ALWAYS sort out your backpacker insurance before your trip. There's plenty to choose from in that department, but a good place to start is Safety Wing. They offer month-to-month payments, no lock-in contracts, and require absolutely no itineraries: that's the exact kind of insurance long-term travellers and digital nomads need.

I took my speed boat tour at 1 pm. It was a good decision because it was super sunny at that time. Atlantis, The Palm from the speedboat Burj Al Arab from the speedboat This is really the best way to see some of the major landmarks of Dubai such as the Dubai Marina, Dubai Eye, Atlantis The Palm Hotel, and the Burj Al Arab. By all means, book the 99-minute boat tour as that's the only one taking you to the Burj Khalifa as well. I tried an hour-long wooden boat tour as well but it's not that wauuu as I thought. So, after trying different boat tours, I can tell you that the speed boat is the most exciting one and the best for nice photos as well. I also highly recommend that you book with the same company I linked here because I can tell you that they are really awesome. They have nice and funny English-speaking guides. And most importantly they take awesome pictures. You'll have so much fun with them.:-) Check rates & book your speed boat tour! 3) GO ON AN UNFORGETTABLE BREAKFAST CRUISE If you like it more relaxed, then take a luxury yacht tour with breakfast or barbecue.

Check rates & book your breakfast cruise! 4) ENJOY THE SUN AT JUMEIRAH BEACH RESORT (JBR) Palm Jumeirah Beach is an extremely popular beach. It's full of people and restaurants. If you are a beach person, just stay there for a while.

DAY 4 of the 7-DAY DUBAI ITINERARY BUR DUBAI (OLD DUBAI) & DEIRA: Dubai Heritage village, Bastakiya Quarter, Dubai Creek, Deira HOW TO GET TO OLD DUBAI By metro: Take the metro to the Al Fahidi Station and from there you can walk to old Dubai. Even if you have a car, better to go there by metro because it's pretty hard to park there. 10 BEST THINGS TO DO IN OLD DUBAI 1) TRY AN INDIAN RESTAURANT When you get to old Dubai, you can find a myriad of inexpensive places to eat. For example, I had Indian Chicken Biryani for 13 AED (~4 USD) with Karak (milk tea) for 2 AED close to the metro station. Alternatively, you can have lunch in an Indian restaurant called Bikanervala in the heritage village. I paid 30 AED (~ 8 USD) for a meal and 7 AED (~ 2 USD) for a Karak (milk tea). As it's a touristy area, the prices are higher. All of them very very tasty. 2) VISIT THE DUBAI MUSEUM From the station walk to the Dubai Museum. The entry fee is 3 AED (~0.80 USD) The Dubai Museum is the primary museum of Dubai. It's right next to the Al Fahidi Fort which is the oldest building in Dubai. Dubai Museum in Old Dubai - Dubai 7 day itinerary 3) VISIT THE DUBAI HERITAGE VILLAGE AND THE BASTAKIYA QUARTER This area is called the Al Fahidi Historical Neighbourhood. The name of the Bastakiya district is named after an Iranian town called Bastak and it was built in the 1890s mostly by rich Persian merchants who came to Dubai to trade. Bastakiya quarter in old Dubai Photoshooting in the old Dubai Bastakiya quarter in old Dubai - Dubai 7 day itinerary Bastakiya quarter in old Dubai - Dubai 7 day itinerary Bastakiya quarter in old Dubai - Dubai 7 day itinerary 4) LEARN ABOUT EMIRATI FOOD AT THE SHAIKH MUHAMMAD CENTER FOR CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING When you are in old Dubai, either participate in the breakfast or lunch program of the Sheikh Mohammed Cultural Center. It lasts for 90 minutes. You need to book well in advance as this event is super popular. In Dubai, you find a lot of international restaurants but not so many places where you can try traditional Emirati dishes. But here you can taste a variety of local Emirati dishes and learn about the customs and traditions of the UAE. Click on the options below to see the details: Breakfast at Sheikh Mohammed Lunch at Sheikh Mohammed Cultural Center 5) LEARN ABOUT COFFEE CULTURE IN THE COFFEE MUSEUM Before or after the cultural center, try coffee in the Coffee Museum where the entrance is 10 AED (~3 USD). Then, stroll around this historical area and check out all the other museums if you have time. Most of them are free. Bastakiya quarter in old Dubai - Dubai 7 day itinerary 6) ARABIAN TEA HOUSE CAFÉ If you are interested in an authentic Emirati experience, go for the Arabian Tea House Restaurant and Cafe which is close to the Coffee Museum. Here, traditional Emirati main courses cost between 60 and 70 AED (~16 - 19 USD). I paid 60 dirhams (~16 USD) for a Chicken Deyay and 25 dirhams (~7 USD) for a hibiscus tea. I can highly recommend both of them. It's not only you getting hungry:-) - Dubai Itinerary 7) SHOP AT THE DUBAI OLD SOUK It's a typical Arabian street market but mostly with Indian sellers. It's a great place to take pictures and buy souvenirs. I actually went to a shop close to the station which looked like a Euro Shop and bought souvenirs there. I bought the same shiny camel for 10 AED that they offered for about 40 AED. What I really enjoyed in the old souk was Indian street food and Karak (milky tea). I asked Pakora for 5 AED and Karak. The Karak on the street costs only 1 AED. No need to ask for the price of the Karak, just pay 1 dirham. As for the Pakora, just ask for it for 5 AED. If you ask the price, you will pay more. This Pakora is actually so filling that it's enough for lunch.

Today it's one of the most visited tourist attractions of Dubai. Old trading boats at the Dubai Creek - Dubai 7 days itinerary 8) TAKE A BOAT RIDE AT THE DUBAI CREEK Dubai Creek has been serving as a fishing area, a pearling site and a gateway for trades for centuries. Today it's one of the most visited tourist attractions of Dubai. Take an abra, traditional wooden boat, from Bur Dubai to the other side of the Dubai Creek to Deira. Taking this water taxi is the most authentic and traditional way of traveling in Dubai. I've done that a few times just for fun.:-) Each boat is for 20 passengers and it costs only 1 AED. If you are willing to pay more you can do it privately. Abra boats in Bur Dubai Trying the old wooden boats called abra at the Dubai Creek is must do in Dubai 9) GET LOST IN GRAND SOUK DEIRA It's a traditional Arabian marketplace labyrinth of mostly covered alleyways. It's also called the Al Souk Al-Kabeer. This is where you can buy a lot of exotic spices, herbs, coffee, and dried fruits such as dates. Make sure you buy dates here. Ask for premium dates which are called Medjool dates in Arabic. Medjool dates are dates of the highest quality. I got big juicy Saudi Arabian dates which I can highly recommend. I bought a lot for my family as a gift and they loved it. Redgold saffron in Deira, Dubai 10) BUY GOLD AT THE DEIRA GOLD SOUK This is a very famous part of the grand market. It's full of jewelry stores. It has about 300 shops selling gold. This is where you can buy jewelry at the best possible rate. Feel free to haggle to get some gold as cheap as possible. One of the many gold shops in Deira - Dubai Itinerary MINIMUM BUDGET FOR THE DAY PER PERSON Lunch: Pakora with Karak: 6 AED 2 Small water: 2 AED Abra twice: 2 AED Dinner: Chicken Biryani with Karak: 15 AED Total: 25 AED (~ 6.10 € / ~ 6.80 USD) DAY 5 of the 7-DAY DUBAI ITINERARY DAY TRIP FROM DUBAI TO ABU DHABI HOW TO TRAVEL TO ABU DHABI FROM DUBAI Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, is an amazing city full of beautiful and fun places. If you want to see the best things to see in Abu Dhabi in one day, you must have your own car or join a tour. If you want to visit Abu Dhabi from Dubai using the public bus running between the two cities, start the day as early as possible. Then, in Abu Dhabi, you should get around by taxi. It's possible to move around by local buses in Abu Dhabi but if you have only one day it's not worth it. It takes too much time to buy bus tickets and the buses rarely run and they are too slow. Taxi is really cheap in Abu Dhabi anyways. HOW TO TRAVEL TO ABU DHABI FROM DUBAI INDEPENDENTLY Cheapest way to get to Abu Dhabi: By bus. From the Ibn Battuta Station to Abu Dhabi Central Station. The buses start at 5 am and they run until midnight every 15 minutes. You can use your NOL card for this ride. One way: 25 AED (~7 USD), ~116 km / 72 mi, 1 h 40 min Fastest way to get to Abu Dhabi: By taxi Dubai to Abu Dhabi taxi fare:~200 AED (~54 USD) - 250 AED (~68 USD), ~1 h 10 mins BEST CITY TOUR FROM DUBAI TO ABU DHABI The best way to visit Abu Dhabi is by joining a tour. Let me show you the best tour from Dubai to Abu Dhabi: Abu Dhabi full-day sightseeing tour from Dubai I recommend this tour because it covers the most tourist attractions in Abu Dhabi. It's an 8 to 9-hour tour including the best things to see in Abu Dhabi: Sheikh Zayed Mosque, The Corniche, in Abu Dhabi, Emirates Palace, Qasr Al Watan and Marina Mall. secure your spot for the best abu dhabi day trip from dubai! 5 BEST PLACES TO VISIT IN ABU DHABI These are the best places that you can see in one day in Abu Dhabi. 1) SHEIKH ZAYED GRAND MOSQUE Establishing this grandiose mosque was one of the amazing projects of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who was the former Ruler of Abu Dhabi for 30 years and the first president of the UAE. His intention was to build a structure that unites the cultural diversity of the Islamic world and where modern and historical art meet. The entrance is free. In the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, you need to cover up. Women must wear headscarf and abaya inside the mosque. You will get one free of charge at the entrance. I bought a nice black abaya with golden embroidery in one of the souvenir shops in the mosque. It cost 150 AED (~37€ / ~ 41USD)). Men need to wear long trousers and full sleeve shirt. In the Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi, UAE - Dubai Itinerary 2) QASHR AL WATAN, THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE In the past, the Presidential Palace was only used for official purposes, such as hosting foreign leaders of states and for highly important presidential meetings. Even after being opened to the public, the palace continues to be used for these purposes. As of today, it's open to the public as well. Sheikhs Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the current Ruler of Abu Dhabi and President of the United Arab Emirates, and Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces decided to show this beautiful palace to the world. The entrance fee for adults is 65 AED (~17.70 USD) and 30 AED for children. Inside the Presidential Palace in Abu Dhabi, UAE - Dubai Itinerary 3) EMIRATES PALACE It's a luxury 5-star hotel with stunning Arabian interiors that you must see. When you are there, you will feel like you were dropped in the most beautiful fairy tale ever. Even if you are not a guest, you can visit the hotel. There is no admission fee. CHECK OUT THE BEAUTIFUL EMIRATES PALACE HERE! 4) ETIHAD TOWERS It's a mind-blowing complex of buildings with five towers. They have a really amazing design. If you are in Abu Dhabi only for one day, you'll not have time to go there but you can see them from the court of the presidential palace. 5) THE CORNICHE, ABU DHABI The Corniche is an 8 km long seaside promenade including a 5,5 km beach, the Corniche Public Beach. If you start walking from the most northern part of the corniche, the Mina Dhow Harbor, in about two hours, you will end up at the Presidential Palace and the Emirates Palace Hotel. When you are there, you can have a nice meal in one of the amazing restaurants on the beach or in the Marina Mall. Check out my travel guide for more information about Abu Dhabi! Best Day Trips from Dubai to Abu Dhabi + Travel Tips DAY 6 of the 7-DAY DUBAI ITINERARY Palm Jumeirah, Atlantis the Palm, Waterpark, The Pointe HOW TO GET TO ATLANTIS THE PALM You can get to the Atlantis the Palm, either by monorail or by taxi. The monorail is much better because the view is so much nicer than from a taxi. HOW TO GET TO THE MONORAIL (Palm Jumeirah Monorail Footbridge) Fastest way: By taxi. Take the tram to the Internet City and then from there take a taxi. Cheapest way: Take the metro to the Damac Properties (Dubai Marina) and then change for the tram to Palm Jumeirah, and then take the walk to the Palm Gateway. You will have to walk through a parking lot to find the monorail. Monorail ticket: You can only buy your ticket on the spot. A single ticket costs 20 AED (~5 USD) and a return ticket costs 30 AED (~8 USD). You can also use the NOL card to pay for your ticket. Palm Jumeirah Monorail - Dubai 7 day itinerary 6 BEST THINGS TO DO IN ATLANTIS DUBAI & AROUND IT 1) MARVEL AT PALM JUMEIRAH FROM THE SKY Palm Jumeirah is the largest artificial island in the world. It's an incredibly fascinating archipelago shaped like a palm tree. It's home to luxury hotels and resorts such as the famous Atlantis, The Palm, beautiful apartment buildings and beachfront villas. If you want to get the best view over this island, you need to fly. The most exciting way to get an epic view over the Palm is from a helicopter. check & book a dubai city heli tour! The world's largest artificial island, Palm Jumeirah, in Dubai, UAE 2) LOOK AROUND ATLANTIS THE PALM When you get to the Atlantis the Palm, you can walk along the coast and in the public area of the Atlantis Hotel. In the public area, you can find a bunch of awesome places of entertainment. In one day, you'll not have time for all these fantastic activities. Thus, you'll need to pick the ones you like the most. Atlantis The Palm Hotel also must be on any Dubai itinerary 3) DISCOVER THE LOST CHAMBERS OF ATLANTIS In the Lost Chambers you will find a water lagoon with 65,000 marine animals including sharks, eels and sea horses. 4) HAVE FUN AT THE AQUAVENTURE WATERPARK The Atlantis Aquapark is the number 1 Waterpark in the Middle East. It's full of crazy adrenalin-pumping rides. 5) SWIM WITH DOLPHINS IN THE DOLPHIN BAY How about making new friends with dolphins? Yes, Dubai is all about unforgettable experiences. You can meet cute dolphins and spend 30 minutes with them in Dubai's Aquaventure Waterpark at Atlantis. This way you can get free access to the Aquaventure Waterpark. This one is actually only in shallow water but there is another activity where you can swim with a dolphin in 3-meter deep water. 6) ENJOY THE POINTE BEACH On the way back, take a taxi or the monorail to The Pointe Beach which was my favorite public beach. From there you also have an amazing view of Atlantis. Especially, in the evening, it's an awesome place to have a dinner with a wonderful view over the illuminated Atlantis the Palm and the monorail. 7) MARVEL AT THE PALM FOUNTAIN SHOW It's similar to the Dubai Fountain Show but it's more colorful and there is no crowd there. I personally like this much more. Palm Fountain's show timings: On weekdays, the first show starts at 6 pm and the last show starts at 10:30 pm. On weekends, luckily the last show starts at midnight. Chilling on a bean bag with a view Atlantis, The Palm and the main rail track A spontanious sport car exhibition DAY 7 of the 7-DAY DUBAI ITINERARY Jumeirah Mosque, Kite Beach, Burj Al Arab, Madinat Jumeirah Start the day with the Jumeirah Mosque. From the mosque, you can take a taxi to Kite Beach. There are buses as well. But save time by taking a taxi. By bus, it would take too much time. From the Kite Beach, you can walk to Jumeira Public Beach. It would take you around 30 - 40 minutes. To be honest, I don't find these public beaches impressive at all. From this Kite Beach, you can go to the Burj Al Arab and take photos with it at the gate. It's very popular among tourists. If you really want to go to beautiful beach, I recommend skipping the Kite Beach and the Jumeira Public Beach, and go to the Ocean Beach. Ocean Beach is a private beach that belongs to the Jumeirah al Naseem Hotel. It's also known as the Madinat Jumeirah private beach but on Google Maps, you will find it as Ocean Beach. If you are not a guest, the day pass to use the beach costs 450 dinars (~123 USD). From this beach, you will have the best view of the iconic Burj Al Arab. From the Burj Al Arab, you can walk to the Madinat Jumeirah where you will find an indoor bazaar and picturesque lake with cozy restaurants. The entrance of Souk Madinat Jumeirah - 7 day itinerary Dubai It's a perfect place for a nice and quiet lunch or dinner. A meal at Madinat Jumeirah costs at least 150 AED (~37 € / ~41 USD). But in most restaurants, you would pay more here. Madinat Jumeirah - One of the best places to visit in Dubai in 7 days 5. WHERE TO STAY IN DUBAI - BEST AREAS TO STAY IN DUBAI Dubai has 6 main areas in terms of accommodation where you can find amazing hotels: Downtown Dubai, The Palm, Dubai Marina and Jumeirah Beach Residence, Bur Dubai, and Deira. 1. DOWNTOWN DUBAI HOTELS Strategically, downtown Dubai is the best area to stay in Dubai as it's situated between old Dubai (Deira) and The Palm. Downtown Dubai is about 12 km from old Dubai and 22 km from The Palm and JBR Beach. There is a lot of different type of supermarkets, shops, and restaurants for all budgets.

They are the most walkable parts of modern Dubai. If you stay here, you are close to the beach, you can jog on the promenade, and find countless amazing, and fancy restaurants and bars. I found these areas much more expensive than Downtown Dubai. Both the restaurants and supermarkets are much more expensive than in Downtime Dubai. I stayed in this area twice: once in Dubai Marina and once in JBR. I really loved staying there. LUXURY HOTEL - The Ritz-Carlton, Dubai Photo credit: via Booking. Com CHECK RATES & BOOK HERE!

ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY TIPS As for my plan for my 7-day plan, day 7 contains must-see places in Dubai. But, to be honest, you can just replace the activities with any of the below-mentioned ones. Miracle Garden It already sounds awesome!:-) It is needless to say that it's the largest flower garden in the world. Here we are talking about 50 million different flowers and 250 million different plants. Entrance fee for the Dubai Miracle Garden 75 AED for adults (~20 USD) 60 AED for children (3-12 y.) (~16 USD) Beach Clubs in Dubai Beach clubs are big in Dubai. Here I collected the 3 best beach clubs in Dubai Zero Gravity: This is a super popular beach club close to the JBR from which you will have a wonderful view of the Dubai Marina. Price for day passes Sunday to Thursday: 160 AED (~44 USD) Friday Brunch AED 295 (~80 USD) for ladies, and AED 345 (~94 USD) for gents Saturday Brunch AED 249 (~68 USD) for ladies, and AED 299 (~81 USD) for gents Opening hours 10:00 - 21:00 Nasimi Beach This is an absolute dream.

But I believe it can be awesome when you are with friends in Dubai. I made some research on clubbing as well.:-) You can follow their accounts on Instagram and see whether you would like them. White Dubai Cavalli Club Antika Bar 7. BEST TIME TO VISIT DUBAI Regarding the best time to travel to Dubai, the most important thing to consider is the weather. The temperature in different seasons is one of the most important things to know before traveling to Dubai. Other important factors could the prices and how crowded Dubai is in different seasons. But at the end of the day, they are all related to the weather. BEST SEASON TO VISIT DUBAI The best season to go to Dubai is winter. The most ideal time to travel to Dubai is anytime from November to April. This is the tourist season in Dubai when it's sunny and pleasantly warm but not too hot. In winter, you can do everything in Dubai. The winter activities in Dubai are limitless. Of course, this is also when Dubai is pretty crowded and hotel rates skyrocket. Hotel prices are 3 or 5 times more than in summer. BEST MONTH TO VISIT DUBAI December - January - February: Dubai Peak Season In terms of the temperatures, the best month to travel to Dubai is definitely one of the winter months: December, January or February. This is literally the peak season. And, obviously, the peak season means the highest hotel prices and the biggest crowds. Christmas is definitely a popular time to visit Dubai. I think it's an absolutely fantastic idea to spend the Christmas holidays in Dubai. Then, in January and February. It's the best time for shopping in Dubai as you can get terrific discounts on really amazing merchandises. In these months, it gets darker earlier, already at 4 am. Therefore, I recommend starting the day early to see as much as possible in daylight. But you will also find a lot of amazing places and activities that are very beautiful and a lot of fun at night. November and March: Best Weather in Dubai This is right before and after the peak season. The weather is consistently pleasant. At this time, the prices are a bit lower for hotels and there is less crowd in Dubai. I spent a couple of weeks in Dubai at the end of November and the beginning of December. I didn't feel it was crowded and the prices were pretty good. I think places such as Munich feel more crowded literally all year long. I traveled to Dubai spontaneously from Iran at the end of November and I didn't know what to expect. But it was an awesome decision. I told myself, hey girl, you just nailed the best time of the year to visit Dubai. Check out the following comparison table I put together. It will surely help you to decide about when you should travel to Dubai. Month in High Season Average High Temperature Average Low Temperature Dubai Temperature November 31 °C / 88 °F 20 °C / 68 °F Dubai Temperature December 26 °C / 79 °F 16 °C / 61 °F Dubai Temperature January 24 °C / 75 °F 14 °C / 57 °F Dubai Temperature February 25 °C / 77 °F 16 °C / 60 °F Dubai Temperature March 29 °C / 84 °F 18 °C / 64 °F WORST TIME TO VISIT DUBAI The worst time to travel to Dubai is summertime: June, July and August. Summer in Dubai is just freaking hot, it's a scorcher. Moreover, it can be extremely humid. Thus, the things to do in Dubai in summer are limited. For most tourists, it will be probably too hot to enjoy their vacation in Dubai. However, this is the cheapest time to go to Dubai. This is when the hotel prices drop. The cheapest month to visit Dubai is probably July when the temperature can get as high as 41 °C / 106 °F. RAMADAN IN 2022 Ramadan, the holy month of Muslims, will be observed next time from April 2 in 2022. If you are not a Muslim, you'll probably not enjoy Dubai this time. It's because in the month of Ramadan you cannot eat, drink or smoke in public as these activities are banned during the day. Moreover, a lot of businesses will be closed during daylight Months in Low Season Average High Temperature Average Low Temperature Dubai Temperature April 33 °C / 91 °F 21 °C / 70 °F Dubai Temperature May 38 °C / 100 °F 25 °C / 77 °F Dubai Temperature June 40 °C / 104 °F 28 °C / 82 °F Dubai Temperature July 41 °C / 106 °F 30 °C / 86 °F Dubai Temperature August 41 °C / 106 °F 31 °C / 87 °F Dubai Temperature September 39 °C / 102 °F 28°C / 82 °F Dubai Temperature October 35 °C / 95 °F 24 °C / 75 °F 8. COVID-19 TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS Dubai is open to tourists. People traveling to Dubai are no longer required to present COVID-19 vaccination certificates or negative PCR test results. 9. GETTING AROUND IN DUBAI BY CAR The best way to get around in the UAE, in general, is by car. If you are on holiday in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, don't waste your time with public transport unless you want to drink alcohol. If you are at least 2 persons, it's worth it 100%. This way you'll save a lot of time. You can check car rentals prices and book a car here on the website of Auto Europe. Prices start at 125 € (~ 140 USD) with full insurance. The fuel prices are affordable as well. Here are some of the fuel prices projected in Dubai. Special 95: 212 AED (~ 0.51 € / 0.58 USD) / litre Super 98: 2.24 AED (~ 0.55 € /0.60 USD) / litre Parking is between 2 -4 AED per hour depending on where you park in the city. Public holidays and weekends have the same fare. DUBAI PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION DUBAI METRO Riding the Dubai Metro is an absolutely fabulous experience. It's one of the most fantastic metro lines in the world. The metro itself is super clean and modern and it runs without a driver. View from the Dubai Metro - Dubai 7 day itinerary DUBAI METRO CARD NOL CARD: Best choice for tourists If you want to use public transport in Dubai, you must have a NOL CARD. It's basically a chip card that you can recharge. About the NOL CARD System: Where can you use the NOL CARD? You can use the Nol Card on the metros, buses, taxies and trams in Dubai. Moreover, you can use your Nol Card for museums, public park entry, parking and even paying for groceries. How much is a Nol card in Dubai? Mine, which was a colorful card, was 20 AED and included 15 AED credit. I think at that time it was some kind of special offer and I could use it for the metro, bus and water bus. This is how to use the Dubai metro card - Dubai 7 day itinerary Getting in the Dubai Metro - Dubai 7 day itinerary Dubai Metro Zones This is very important to understand. Dubai has 7 zones. The rate you pay for traveling by metro and tram depends on from which zone to which zone you are traveling. There are 7 zones and 3 payment rates. Tier 1 in zone 1: you travel only within one zone or less than 3 km crossing 2 zones Tier 2 in zone 2: you start in one zone and finish in a neighboring zone Tier 3 in zone 3-7: you travel in three or more zones Where can you get a NOL card in Dubai? In all Dubai Metro stations and at certain Dubai Bus stations From RTA Customer Service Centers and RTA authorized sales points From ticket vending machines Dubai Metro Prices Nol Red Ticketdub Validity: Only on one type of public transport Nol Red Ticket fares costs 2 UAD minimum amount to recharge; 7.50 AED 1 zone: 4 AED 2 zones: 6 AED 3+ zones: 8.50 AED Nol Silver Ticket Validity: in regular class on the metro tram and water taxi Nol Silver Ticket fares cost 25 AED including 19 AED credit (e-purse value) minimum amount to recharge; 7.50 AED 1 zone: 3 AED 2 zones: 5 AED (for example Burj Khalifa - Dubai Marina) 3 zones: 7.50 AED (for example Dubai Airport - Burj Khalifa) Nol Gold Ticket This is the best Dubai metro card. If you have the Nol Card, you have access to the seats of Gold Class of the Dubai Metro. It's really worth it. In the morning and in the evening the metro in Dubai can be completely full which is not fun when you are a tourist in Dubai. Validity: in gold class on the metro and tram + on a regular water taxi Nol Gold Ticket and fares cost 25 AED including 19 AED credit (e-purse value) minimum amount to recharge; 7.50 AED 1 zone: 6 AED 2 zones: 10 AED 3 zones: 15 AED I had the silver card: I spent around 150 AED in two weeks and I was on the go every single day. I used the card for the metro, buses, and tram. When my parents visited Dubai, they bought the Gold Nol Card. They loved the Gold Class. DUBAI METRO TIMING The metro is running every 3 minutes during the day and it's super fast. The metro is super efficient too. ABOUT USING THE DUBAI METRO One end of the metro is only for women and children. I always used that. This way you will have an awesome view of the metro rails and the building along the way. As for the bus, I don't really recommend it. Instead, take a taxi. Taking the bus might save you money but you will loose a lot of time as I did when I tried the buses. The other end of the metro is the gold class for gold card users. If I were a man, I would travel there so that I had a nice view from the metro. This is also why I recommended the Nol Gold Card to my parents. Between the two ends, you have the mixed sections for regular cardholders. I tried only once and it was enough. It was so smelly. To go to Abu Dhabi you can use the same card you use in Dubai. DUBAI TRAM It's super nice as well. I absolutely loved traveling by tram in Dubai. Make sure you have a sweater with you when you use the metro and the bus. They use a lot of cold air conditioning and it can be too cold. DUBAI BUSES I don't recommend buses if you are on vacation in Dubai. Commuting by bus simply takes too much time. If the metro and the tram don't take you where you want to travel to, take a taxi. TAXI IN DUBAI Taxi is cheap in Dubai. You can use taxi apps or get a taxi from the street. Dubai Taxi Apps Quite often, it might be more convenient to use a taxi app such as Uber and Careem. But it always seemed to me that they charge you more than a taxi from the street. In any case, in a lot of situations, booking a taxi using a taxi booking app is just so much more convenient. Dubai Taxi Fare Examples 5 km costs 16 AED (~4.40 USD) 7 km costs 20 AED (~6 USD) 50 km: 100 AED (~27 USD) The taxi meter is in every taxi and it's compulsory to use it including airport taxis. Don't make deals with taxi drivers. If you try it, you will probably pay more than the official rates. You can only pay with cash. As for taxi drivers, be careful. They are extremely nice and polite but they can be tricky. Always follow the route on Google maps and know where you want to go. And do stop the driver if he drives you further than you need. Once one driver said: \"Oh, I missed the turn, sorry.\" So I ended up paying more because he had to drive too much until he could turn back. Another time, when I clearly told the driver where I want to be dropped off, he drove two tram stops further, even though he could have dropped me where I wanted it. Once I noticed it, we had to drive a lot forward until we could turn back. Again, I ended up paying more than I should have. Once in Abu Dhabi, I had only 100 AED and the driver told me that he had no cashback at all. And imagine, he expected me to go somewhere where I can change money and of course pay for the ride. The lesson from the story: always have change with you or before taking the taxi, ask the driver if he has cashback if you have a bigger note. As for taxis, there are also luxury taxis: the more beautiful cars are more expensive. MY TRAVEL COSTS IN DUBAI INCLUDING ABU DHABI IN TWO WEEKS This will give you an idea of how much you will spend if you use public transport and taxis while vacationing in Dubai. Dubai - Abu Dhabi: 2 return tickets, 100 AED (~27 USD) Public transport in Dubai: ~ 70 AED (~19 USD) Taxi in Dubai and Abu Dhabi: ~ 120 AED (~33 USD) Water taxi in Dubai: 13 AED (~4 USD) Public transport in Abu Dhabi: 20 AED (~5 USD) In Total: 323 AED (~88 USD) 10. IS DUBAI SAFE? IS IT SAFE TO TRAVEL TO DUBAI? I felt safe both as a human being and as a woman. In Dubai, there are a lot of rules and if people don't follow them, they are in trouble. Therefore, people are more disciplined. IS DUBAI SAFE FOR WOMEN? I consider Dubai safe for women including solo female travelers. I spent the entire two weeks there by myself. IS DUBAI SAFE FOR AMERICANS? Absolutely, it is. It's out of the question. 11. WHAT TO WEAR IN DUBAI? What to wear in Dubai is an interesting question. This question mainly concerns women. To put things into perspective, remember that the United Arab Emirates is a Muslim country. Inspite of the fact that tourists and residents are not required to dress modestly anymore because Dubai's main goal is to attract tourists and expats from all around the world, I know that local Emiratis do not feel comfortable with the way most foreign women are dressed up. As I see it most foreign women completely disrespect the local culture with they are dressed up. However, I personally believe that respecting the local culture wherever we are as guests is extremely important. What Do Women Wear in Dubai In Dubai, you will find women wearing all kinds of things. You will see women wearing Islamic dresses such as abayas and women wearing western clothing. What Women Should Wear in Dubai On the one hand, I think it doesn't matter what you are wearing because nobody will say anything if you are not wearing modest clothing. On the other hand, as I said it's crucial to respect the culture where you are a guest. I personally cannot ignore the fact that I'm in a Muslim country where you are expected to dress modestly. I do respect that. Let me tell you how I dress up when I'm in Dubai. The only places where I was wearing short things are the Dubai Marina, JBR, and beaches. These are neighborhoods and places where most of the residents are western expats. However, everywhere else, I would only wear long pants or skirts and I would wear shirts that do not reveal too much cleavage and cover my shoulders. That's only me. I'm so used to traveling in Muslim countries and I cannot do it any other way. I would just feel that I'm disrespecting the culture. Actually, in Dubai, I prefer covering up also because inside malls, hotels, and the metro, they have air conditioning which is super cold compared to the temperature outside. Frequently Asked Questions Regarding What to Wear in Dubai Do you have to cover up in Dubai? No, you don't have to cover up totally in Dubai unless you visit a mosque. Can you wear shorts in Dubai? Officially, you are not supposed to. However, a lot of foreigners including Europeans, Americans, and Asians are actually wearing shorts in Dubai in every neighborhood. I personally would not do it. Wearing a short in Dubai Marina, JBR and places for swimming, sunbathing, and partying is ok. Can you wear a bikini in Dubai? Yes, on the beaches, in the beach clubs, aquaparks, and in the swimming area of hotels and resorts. What clothes should I wear in Dubai? For hot days, you can buy light and airy cotton clothes that cover your body. There are really a lot of nice dresses for the warm months that are both comfortable and modest at the same time. What Not to Wear in Dubai? These are the things that you should not wear in areas other than Dubai Marina, JBR, beach, and beaches for tourists and ex-pats. Too tight dresses Transparent clothes Tops where your bra can be seen Too short skirts and shorts Dresses and shirts showing too much cleavage Clothes showing too much skin You can; however, wear them in nightclubs, beach clubs and in most hotels and resorts. But I as I said, there are a lot of people, both residents and tourists, who are ignoring these rules. I personally advise my readers to respect the local culture by keeping in mind the dress code in Dubai. 12. ALCOHOL IN DUBAI Dubai is home to nearly 9 million ex-pats and before the coronavirus pandemic, each year Dubai received around 16 million tourists. Thus, buying alcohol in Dubai and drinking alcohol in Dubai are possible in many places. The Dubai drinking laws and rules are quite strict but as a tourist, you will hardly feel it. Officially, drinking alcohol is only allowed for non-Muslims. But in reality, Muslims drink alcohol in Dubai as much as non-Muslims. Where can you drink alcohol in Dubai In hotels, restaurants, bars, and clubs, you can drink alcohol. I've never seen anywhere that Muslims were asked about their religion when they ordered alcohol. Drinking in public and drunk driving Drinking in public places including beaches is illegal in Dubai. Buying alcohol at a store To purchase alcohol at a store, you need to go to a licensed liquor store, acquire your alcohol license and you are ready to get your booze. As a tourists, you can apply for an instant 30-day alcohol license with your passport and Dubai entry stamp. It's totally free. To find liquor stores, just google dubai liquor stores. If you don't want to deal with that, buy your booze at Duty-Free inside the airport when you arrive in Dubai. You can purchase up to 4 liters of booze or two cartons of beer. Drinking age in Dubai By law, you must be at least 21 years old to drink alcohol in Dubai. 13. DUBAI SIM CARD Buying a SIM card is important in Dubai. If you have a Dubai sim card, you can call a taxi, make reservations, and use google maps and taxi apps to get around Dubai. 13.1. BUYING AN eSIM An eSIM makes it much easier to switch mobile networks. Instead of searching for the sim card shop, hunting for a SIM 'ejector tool' to remove the old SIM from your phone, then inserting it into your phone, you can switch to a different network with a phone call or online. Check out the rates of the United Arab Emirates eSIM provided by Airalo. 8.50 USD: 1 GB, 7 days 22.50 USD: 3 GB, 30 days 35 USD: 5 GB, 30 days 13.2. PREPAID SIM CARD UNITED ARAB EMIRATES PREPAID SIM CARD DUBAI AIRPORT As soon as you get to Dubai, buy a SIM card. In terms of prices, it doesn't matter where you buy your sim card at the airport or elsewhere. The prices are the same or almost the same everywhere.

IS DUBAI EXPENSIVE Generally, I don't find Dubai expensive. A vacation in Italy, Germany or Croatia would cost you way more than a vacation in Dubai. Yes, you can find the most expensive and luxurious hotels in the world in Dubai but you can also find cheap accommodation such as hostels for 25 USD per night. Yes, there are a lot of expensive restaurants in Dubai but most restaurants are affordable. Average, you pay around 10 USD for lunch or dinner in very nice places. Moreover, in Old Dubai, you can get very delicious Indian food for less than 3 USD. The public transport and taxis are really cheap in Dubai. In Dubai, you can spend a lot of money if you stay in expensive hotels and choose to participate in all the fun activities that I recommended in this travel guide. The limit is the sky. However, if you are a budget traveler, you can easily manage on 350 USD per week or even less. Below, you can see some of the prices I collected on the way. 15.

While visiting Dubai last fall I took notes everyday which led to this post, Dubai Travel Guide for First Time Visitors ! I don't know about you but one of the most frustrating things to me when preparing for a trip is researching items all over the internet. I review so many articles to gather enough information to make sure I am prepared for that city or country. Because let's face it, how many of us have time to read an entire Lonely Planet book? (Although I do still occasionally download them :) Therefore, I will continue to write travel guides for my readers. My first post about Dubai included my favorite pictures and was on overview of how I spent 5 days there. That post will help you build your Dubai itinerary. This post is a long list of Dubai travel tips that will cover almost everything else you need to know. So here is my Dubai Travel Guide! Do You Need a Visa to Go to Dubai? No--with a US passport, you do not need a visa to go to Dubai (or Abu Dhabi), which is a part of The United Arab Emirates. How to Travel to Dubai We took Emirates airlines directly from NYC to Dubai. They had a 2 for 1 deal airfare which was great! Emirates airlines has deals often and they fly from several cities across America so I do suggest signing up on their website. They also offer free layoversin Dubai. We met several people who were taking advantage of traveling to other countries on Emirates but stopped in Dubai on the way. You can also fly on Etihad Airways into Abu Dhabi and take a shuttle bus or taxi one hour to Dubai. Qatar Airways is another option. They make a stop in Doha before continuing on to Dubai. Of course you can use US based airlines as well. The Best Times to Visit Dubai is HOT! I know-Duh. During the \"winter months\", which correlate to ours, the temperatures are cooler with highs in the 80s to lows in the 60s. This is from November to March. Based on these temperatures, this is tourist season in Dubai, so expect it to be more crowded and prices to be a bit higher if you plan your Dubai trip for this time period. However, in the summer months from June to August, temperatures average a high of 105! The Best Places to Stay There is no shortage of hotels in Dubai, especially luxury hotels. You can also check rental sites such as Airbnb. In terms of the best location, you should first think of Dubai as a long strip. I compare it to Las Vegas or Cancun if you have been to either. We kept driving back and forth, up and down the same main road. The most central location, and hence the most crowded, is around the Dubai mall which is where Burj Khalifa is located. At the other end is the Dubai Marina with Palm Jumeirah and Burj Al Arab close by. On the complete opposite end of this \"strip\" is the Dubai airport and Old Dubai with the souks. Along most of this strip is Jumeirah Beach filled with beach resorts, shops and restaurants. Based on your interests, you may prefer to stay closer to one of these landmarks. Getting Around Dubai Just like any major city and tourist area, there is a lot of traffic in Dubai. There is also rush hour traffic. You should be aware that the work week in Dubai is Sunday through Thursday. Their weekend days are Friday and Saturday. This affects the time it takes by car/taxi getting from one location to the next. Traffic is much lighter on the weekends. Taxis For the best prices use the regular taxi cabs and not the fancy Lexus taxis. Check to see if there is a meter in the taxi and you can also ask what the price will be from one location to the next. For example, we were unaware of an automatic surcharge leaving from the Metro station on Palm Jumeirah to the Dubai Mall. Metro Dubai has a very clean and easy to use Metro system. During the week and rush hour this may be your best bet based on the traffic. However, the day we used it we found it be crowded (no seats available), we had to change trains and wait for long stretches since it was a weekend day and the distance to the metro in the Dubai mall was a long walk! It took us over an hour to get to our location using the Metro so give yourself plenty of time if you have to change trains. During the week the trains run more often. Hop On/Hop Off Buses This is another way to see Dubai and there are two systems available. Both are located at the Dubai mall for pickup and have different routes that take you to all the main areas. Unfortunately, due to Thursday rush hour traffic we were not able to see as much as we would like on our bus. Therefore, if you decide to do this, start early in the morning, do it on a weekend or purchase a multi-day pass. What to Wear in Dubai This is a source of stress for many people traveling to the United Arab Emirates, especially those wondering about traveling to Dubai as a woman. I found this article prior to our trip that was very helpful. Basically, tourists and ex-pats wear regular clothes. The only time I wore a traditional hijab and abaya was visiting the Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi. I expect that would be the same whenvisiting any mosque. While on the beach I was actually surprised just how skimpy people were dressed or not dressed :)You are also expected to have on closed-toe shoes with pants or long skirts for ladies with your shoulders covered while dining in restaurants in Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab. PDA in public Before arriving in Dubai my husband read that we could get arrested for public displays of affection while in Dubai, so we refrained. I later read that holding hands and a peck on the cheek are fine. How Much is a Trip to Dubai? Money, Money, Money! Although I am sure there is a budget friendly way to do Dubai, I found it to be costly or at least comparable to the US. Their currency is called \"dirham\" or AED for Arab Emirate Dirham. You may see it abbreviated ads Dhs or DH. The dollar bill denominations conveniently have Arabic on one side and English on the other side. There are coins as well. The current conversion is 1 Dirham equals 0.27 USD. But again, once I did the conversions for taxis, food, tours and our hotel, it was equivalent or more to what I would pay in the US. Keep in mind I am a luxury blogger somy activities includedhigh tea at Burj Al Arab, a stayat a luxury hotel on the Dubai Marina and I did some private tours. You can exchange money on arrival at the airport but we noticed a slightly better exchange rate at the malls. And there are plenty of malls. In terms of American credit cards, most places only take Mastercard or Visa. Our hotel and the Nike store in the Dubai Mall accepted American Express but that was it-based on our experience. Do They Speak English in Dubai? We found that most people were fluent in English and the street signs, menus, basically all the signage was in both Arabic and English. This made it very easy to navigate. Come with me on food & wine adventures around the world- Culinary Travels ! Food & Alcohol The food is fresh and it is delicious! Dubai is known for multicultural cuisine and pretty much anything you arewant to eat you will find here. I was excited to try authentic Middle Eastern dishes. There is a heavy Asian, includingIndian,influence to the food in Dubai which I noticed while having brunch at Saffron at the Atlantis resort. Since this is a Muslim region, do not expect to find pork in the restaurants. However, there is plenty of seafood, lamb, beef and chicken. Popular dishes include shawarma (sliced meat like a kebab), hummus, curried dishes, basmati rice and marinated whole fish (I ate a whole sea bass vs a filet while in Dubai). Dates are also very popular. They come in many varieties and you will find date markets and fancy date shops in the malls. Try some with Arabic coffee. Please, pleaseignore all the American fast food places while in Dubai! Alcohol: Tourists are allowed to drink at licensed hotels, bars and restaurants in Dubai. Our hotel fridge was fully stocked! However, you are not allowed to drink in public, including on the beach. Public drunkenness is also not allowed (if only this was the case in the US :) In order to purchase alcohol in Dubai you would need a license. To get around this you may purchase alcohol at the duty free shop at the airport. Things NOT to do in Dubai For more about the \"can't miss\" things to do and see in Dubai, check out my post on how I spent my five days there. But sometimes it's just as important to get travel tips on \"CAN miss\" tourist activities. Based on my experience, these are the attractions in Dubai that you don't really need to stress about fitting into your trip. The Top of Burj Khalifa Although crowded, it waswellrun operation. However, I was not impressed with the views from the top. Granted, it was a bit hazy that day but most of what we saw were the skyscrapers close by and the desert. If you have been to top of other buildings such as the Empire State Building or the John Hancock Building, I think you will be disappointed. Friday Buffet Brunch at Saffron in the Atlantis Resort Brunch in Dubai is held on Fridays. I chose Saffron since it was described as a fun day party. It was really brunch on steroids. There was a DJ and more food and alcohol than you can consume in 3 or 4 hours. If you are going with a group, I think this will be fun. If you are looking for a more intimate or fine dining brunch experience, this is not it. Atlantis, The Palm Speaking of Atlantis, if you have seen pictures of Palm Jumeirah you have noticed the Atlantis resort sitting at the end. Although I have visited Atlantis in the Bahamas, after gazing at this man-made island for years I knew I had to visit the island and the resort. We took the monorail to Atlantis in order to see the individual islands that make up the Palm. That part was pretty cool. However, Atlantis was an enormous hotel/resort with people everywhere. There were security guards making sure tourists did not enter areas for the guests and it took forever to find Saffron. But, if you do love Vegas style hotels with the high ceilings, designer shops, multiple restaurants and large crowds then you will love Atlantis. If not, stay away from it! lol The Dubai Fountains The Dubai Fountains are located at the Dubai Mall. They were designed by the same architects of the fountains at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. We waited 30 minutes in a hot crowd to watch 3 minutes of the fountain show. It was quick and not as elaborate as I had imagined. I was disappointed. I have been told it depends on the length and type of the song. There are restaurants with outdoor patios located around the fountains so if you have time sit and watch more than one performance. A Day Trip to Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi is located approximately 1 to 1 hours driving distance from Dubai depending on the traffic, so it makes a good option if you're looking for places to go from Dubai. There are many popular attractions in Abu Dhabi including the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, Yas Island and Emirates Palace. If you choose to do a day trip to Abu Dhabi from Dubai you can take a daily public shuttle bus, hire a taxi, rent a car, or do a private tour. Since we wanted to see a lot in a short time, we decided on a private tour. Emirates Adventures picked us up from our hotel for a full day tour of Abu Dhabi. Again, depending on your budget, there are many options available. Whew, you made it to the end! I know this is a lot of information to take in but I hope this Dubai Travel Guide has been helpful, especially for first time visitors. Be sure to read \" How I spent 5 Days in Dubai & Abu Dhabi \" for more information. Overall I enjoyed our trip to Dubai. It was modern, clean, easy to get around, the history is interesting, the food was delicious, the Arabian sea was warm, and there were lots of activities to choose from. I wish we had more time in Old Dubai and I definitely enjoyed our afternoon and evening in Burj Al Arab, our day trip to Abu Dhabi and the desert safari. Have you been to Dubai?

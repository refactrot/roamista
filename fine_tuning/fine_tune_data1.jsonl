Not only is it an icon of American history and culture, but it also has so many amazing things to do. I\u2019ve been to New York over 10 times (it\u2019s possible to\ndrive from Washington DC\n) and have crafted the perfect New York itinerary for 3 days.\nIt\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed when thinking about what to do in New York. In this 3 day New York itinerary, I\u2019ll share the best things to do in New York City on your trip and help you decide what you really want to try to fit in by giving you options depending on whether you\u2019re a foodie, history buff, or view seeker!\nTable of Contents\nPhoto purchased on shutterstock.com\nGetting There\nBus, train, drive, or fly? I\u2019ve done all four, which have pros and cons depending on your budget and where you are traveling from. I\u2019ll outline each below.\nDrive\nIf you\u2019re taking a car or coming to New York, you can drive here, but there are some things you should know.\nTolls are expensive to get into the city, and you\u2019ll have to cross over one from almost any direction to get there. Once you are in the city and over the bridges, you will likely not have to worry about any more tolls. All New York toll roads are cashless and require a small removable transponder to pay your toll.\nToll booths in New York\nare managed by\nE-ZPass\n, and transponders can be obtained online.\nNew York is famous for its traffic, and it is sometimes terrible. A few miles can take you over an hour to get across, so plan ahead!\nLast, parking on the street is hard to come by in most areas and will likely have restrictions. I\u2019d recommend you plan ahead and pay for parking before getting to New York to save time and money. Many hotels and garages will charge more than $50 a day for parking, so it\u2019s best to plan ahead so you aren\u2019t stuck with a giant bill.\nBus\nMany different bus lines operate up and down the East Coast, and while not always the most convenient, they tend to be the cheapest way to get to New York.\nMegaBus, Greyhound, Peter Pan, Best Bus, and more offer bus tickets to New York for as low as $5. I took one of these buses, and while it did take longer than the other options below, it was the cheapest.\nTrain\nAmtrak lines connect New York to essentially every major city along the East Coast with regular and high-speed service daily in and out of Penn Station and Moynihan Train Hall. The train hall is right in the center of Manhattan, making it a great place to start your New York trip.\nFlights\nThere are three airports close to New York City, and you can fly into any of the three and take public transit to get into the city.\nJFK International Airport\nJohn F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, is New York\u2019s largest airport. It\u2019s about 15 miles from Midtown Manhattan and is served by over 70 international and domestic airlines. From JFK, you can catch a cab to anywhere in Manhattan for\na flat fee of $52\n, plus tax, tolls, gratuity, and a surcharge of $4.50 during peak hours from 4 to 8 pm on weekdays.\nIf you want to skip the private ride, JFK\u2019s\nAirTrain\noperates 24/7 and links the airport to several public transit options for an $8 ticket. Hop on the AirTrain Red line to catch the Long Island Railroad or the J-Z and E trains at Jamaica Station, or take the Airtrain Green line to connect to the A train at Howard Beach station. Taking the Long Island Railroad from Jamaica Station will take you to Manhattan\u2019s Penn Station in about 20 minutes.\nLaGuardia Airport\nLaGuardia Airport in East Elmhurst, Queens, is approximately eight miles from Midtown and serves mostly domestic destinations, with a few flights arriving from Canada. From there, ride a metered taxi (which will also charge tolls and tips) or catch one of two city buses (the Q70 and the M60) to connect with the subway. You\u2019ll need patience for the latter and the swipe of a MetroCard for $2.75.\nNewark Liberty International Airport\nNewark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, is 16 miles from Midtown and is a hub for domestic and international flights. Metered taxis will transport you to the city, though it can cost around $100 with tolls and tips. AirTrain Newark, however, connects to NJ Transit for an easy, cheaper ride into Penn Station in under 30 minutes.\nWhere to Stay\nThere are so many amazing areas to stay in New York it\u2019s hard to narrow it down, but below, I\u2019ll outline three areas I\u2019d recommend for your trip, ranging from the cheapest to most expensive options. All are located close to the places on this itinerary and accessible by subway.\nLong Island City\nLong Island City sounds super far from Manhattan, right? Well, it\u2019s just across the water from Midtown Manhattan (pictured above on the right) and is just two train stops away from many sites worth visiting. Long Island City is known for its gleaming high-rises with sweeping views of Manhattan. Innovative art galleries, performance spaces, and pockets of trendy bars and restaurants can be found all over this area.\nThis area is more affordable than Manhattan, but still very convenient to get to everything on this itinerary. Generally speaking, it\u2019s the cheapest area on this list for hotels!\nRecommended hotels:\nThe Local NY\n(hostel, good location)\nTownePlace Suites by Marriott\n(comfortable, views of the river)\nHilton Garden Inn\n(comfortable, great location, easy parking)\nRavel Hotel\n(trendy, great view of Manhattan)\nLower East Side\nIf you\u2019re looking for a more local feel in a neighborhood with some of the best food, then this is the perfect place to stay. The eclectic Lower East Side is where gritty alleys and tenement-style buildings mix with upscale apartments and chic boutiques. Nighttime draws hip, young crowds to the area\u2019s trendy bars, music venues, and restaurants. The neighborhood\u2019s Jewish heritage lives on through Orchard Street\u2019s Lower East Side Tenement Museum, fabric stores, and traditional delis such as Katz\u2019s and Russ & Daughters.\nRecommended hotels:\nHotel Indigo\n(great rooftop, modern feel, rooftop pictured on left of this section)\nMoxy Hotel\n(trendy, easy parking)\nMidtown Manhattan\nMidtown Manhattan is full of the most popular things to do in New York. It\u2019s centrally located, but also the most crowded of the three areas I am recommending. This is not a good spot to stay if you drive in, as parking is the most challenging/expensive in this part of the city. It is the most convenient location and walkable to many things on this New York itinerary (3 days) for most trips; I wouldn\u2019t recommend staying in this area, but because this is a short one, being centrally located can be a good thing.\nRecommended hotels:\nMarriott Marquis\n(in Times Square, great views)\ncitizenM Hotel\n(blocks off Times Square, upscale feel)\nCivilian Hotel\n(modern, boutique)\nGetting Around\nPublic Transportation\nThe New York City subway system is one of the best systems in the world for public transportation. You\u2019ll find a local subway stop just a few blocks away from almost everywhere on your New York itinerary. I would highly recommend getting a subway pass and taking it for the majority of your trip!\nYou can get a prepaid card, or you can get a single trip card. If you\u2019re paying per ride, you get one free transfer within two hours of your first swipe (bus to bus or train to bus only). Once you exit through the subway turnstiles, you can\u2019t transfer to another line or reenter the station without paying again.\nAn unlimited card gives you as many transfers as you\u2019d like, but you can\u2019t use it at the same station within 18 minutes of your first swipe, so individual or pay-as-you-go cards are the best options if you\u2019re sharing with travel companions.\nFor contactless payment, you can either pick up an OMNY card and top up your account online or tap your contactless credit or debit card or electronic device on an OMNY reader to pass through the turnstile.\nTaxis or Uber?\nNew York City has the most expensive Ubers in the U.S., at $34.74 per 6.2 miles.\nBoth conventional taxis and Uber charge fares based on a combination of time and distance Ta. s do not have surge pricing and use old-world pricing, but riders might have to wait longer when demand exceeds supply. Uber does not differentiate between cruising and stop-and-go traffic, while taxis charge different rates based on speed.\nThe results might shock you. She found that without tips or surge pricing, hailing a cab was always less expensive than an UberX or a standard Lyft. Cab prices averaged 35-83% less than a ride-share. Prices for the same rides on the taxi cab app CURB varied.\nI say all this to tell you, expect to pay a lot when you get a taxi or Uber in New York, expect to be stuck in a lot of traffic, and avoid this when possible.\nDay 1: Central Park, Upper East Side, Midtown\nOn your first day in New York, it\u2019s time to see some of the most iconic sites that the city has and take in some of the biggest sites to knock those off your list. Spend a morning in Central Park, then head to the Met. From there, walk around the Upper East Side (stroll Madison Ave), then end your day in Times Square.\nCentral Park\nThis is one of the most magical places in New York and the perfect place to start your trip. Start at the southern part of the park and walk from there in order to do everything on this itinerary. I\u2019d recommend choosing 1-3 stops listed below. Otherwise, you won\u2019t have enough time to do everything on this itinerary!\n1. Picnic in Sheeps Meadow or by the Pond: Grab a bagel from pretty much anywhere before going into the park. Bring it with you into the south side of the park and choose a spot. You can either hang out in Sheeps Meadow, which is known for its picnics and you\u2019ll likely see lots of New Yorkers hanging out here on a nice day. The Pond is home to the Gapstowe Bridge and close to Wollman Rink (where you can ice skate in the winter!).\n2. Central Park Zoo: This is a stop I\u2019d recommend making with kids or if you are an animal lover. Not far from the Pond, you\u2019ll find the Central Park Zoo.\n$20 for Adults / $15 for Children (3-12) & free (2 & under) / $17 for seniors (65+)\nPro-tip\n: General admission tickets are included with the purchase of the\nNew York Go City Sightseeing Pass\n, which is a\ntourist discount pass\nperfect for doing a lot of activities in NYC.\n3. Bethesda Terrace and Fountain: Bethesda Terrace and Fountain are two architectural features overlooking the southern shore of the Lake in New York City\u2019s Central Park. The fountain, with its Angel of the Waters statue, is located in the center of the terrace. This is one of the prettiest and most famous parts of Central Park!\n4. Rent a Row Boat: Central Park Boathouse has partially reopened, and the rowboats are available to rent as of June 17, 2023. Until notified, boats are available by walk-up and paid for with credit card or Apple Pay only. Online bookings will soon also be available through reservation service OpenTable. The restaurant\u2019s interior is being upgraded, and plans to reopen this fall.\n5. Belvedere Castle: Walk through the Ramble (a beautiful part of the park, especially in fall) to one of the most iconic features in Central Park. This miniature castle is located atop the huge rock outcrop known as Vista Rock, the second highest natural point in Central Park.\nThe entire complex, completed in 1872, was designed as a place from which to enjoy views of the surrounding landscape; the building originally had no windows or doors, as it was intended as an open-air lookout tower. It houses a welcome center, gift shop, and lookout point worth climbing to!\nFrom Belvedere Castle, head to the Met!\nThe\nMetropolitan Museum of Art\n(The Met)\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art is one of the world\u2019s largest and finest art museums. Its collection spans 5,000 years of world culture, from prehistory to the present and from every part of the globe.\nWhile its entire building space is technically smaller than the Louvre, the Metropolitan Museum covers the largest floor area of any museum in the world, at an incredible 2 million square feet.\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 by a group of American citizens \u2013 business people and financiers as well as leading artists and thinkers of the day \u2013 who wanted to create a museum to bring art and art education to the American people.\nAfter exploring for a few hours, make sure to take a break and head up to the\nMet\u2019s rooftop\n. They have drinks and bites to try with a view overlooking Central Park and Manhattan. It\u2019s beautiful and a great stop from all the walking you\u2019ve been doing!\nGeneral Admission\n: Adults, $30; Seniors (65 and over), $22; Students, $17; Children (under 12), Free.\nThe New York Go City Sightseeing Pass\ngrants free same-day admission to all of the Met Museum locations.\nYou can also book a\nMet Tour through Walks Tours\n, one of my absolute favorite tour companies!\nOpen 10 am \u2013 5 pm Sunday \u2013 Tuesday & Thursday (closed Wednesday), 10 am \u2013 9 pm weekends.\nMadison Ave\nIf you have more time and want to do some shopping, Madison Ave is the right way to walk back down to Midtown Manhattan to get to your evening in Times Square!\nMadison Avenue features the flagship boutiques of the finest fashion & jewelry designers, world class art galleries, exquisite restaurants, spas, and salons for exclusive pampering. Shop small designers, or maybe you just like to window shop from the most famous luxury stores It\u2019s all possible here!\nTimes Square\nEnd your day in the iconic Times Square. Times Square in New York City is one of the most iconic and bustling places on Earth. This area, located at the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, is home to some of the world\u2019s largest billboards and signs, making it a must-see destination for any traveler or tourist.\nThe most famous street and section of Times Square is Broadway. This is where you\u2019ll spot the flashy lights and advertisements, where the ball drops on New Year\u2019s Eve, and the heart of the commercial district in this area where you\u2019ll find shops, restaurants, and the TKTS ticket counter to get Broadway tickets. You\u2019ll want these for day two, but more tips on getting them later!\nWhile in Times Square, I\u2019d recommend eating at Serafina for some fantastic Italian. They have a few locations, are quick, and serve up good eats.\nIf you plan on exploring New York at night, this is the night to do it! Take a cruise along the river to take in the views, visit an observatory at night, or hit the bars on the Lower East Side. There\u2019s a lot to do at night in New York!\nDay 2: Hudson Yards, Chelsea, Broadway\nOn day two, we\u2019re checking out Hudson Yards, home to the Edge Observatory and the Hive. From there, walk the Highline over to Chelsea Market. Get a late brunch at one of the fantastic spots and see Little Island. After that, head back toward Midtown and the day with a Broadway show!\nHudson Yards\nHudson Yards is NYC\u2019s built-up neighborhood with new real estate, a fancy subway station that serves the 7 train as well as a handful of attractions like a one-million-square-foot retail center with over 100 places to go\nshopping in NYC\n, eat at cute\nrestaurants\n, cultural performance venue\nThe Shed\n, a five-acre innovative park and Vessel\u2014a giant, metal beehive It\u2019s also home to Edge\u2014NYC\u2019s highest observation deck.\nI\u2019d recommend exploring Hudson Yards in the morning and getting a brunch reservation at Peak (at the Edge) in the morning for a perfect start to your day!\nPeak\nis a stunning restaurant space located on the 101st floor at the summit of the 1,296-foot tall tower, one level above Edge \u2013 the highest observation deck in the Western Hemisphere. Peak is a modern American destination, blending stunning views of New York City with elevated menus Plus when you eat here, you get free entry to the Edge.\nEdge tickets are $38 a piece, and a meal at Peak will run you about the same. Why not get food AND a view for $38 instead of just the view? Make sure you\nmake a reservation\nin advance to secure a spot.\nOpen 11 \u2013 10:30 pm on weekends, 11:30 am \u2013 10 pm on weekdays.\nNote: Entry into the Edge and many other things on this list are included in the\nNew York Go City Sightseeing Pass\n. It\u2019s worth checking out for your first trip!\nHighline\nAfter getting a fantastic view of New York City, walk to Chelsea Market on the Highline.\nPrior to 1934, Tenth Avenue was known as \u201cDeath Avenue\u201d because of the many accidents caused by then at-grade trains that ran on the street. New York Central Railroad built a new elevated train to service the area and improve safety; the West Side elevated, which we now know as The High Line.\nTrains passed through approximately 30 buildings, including meat packers and the Nabisco factory, which added to the neighborhood\u2019s distinctive architecture. Freight traffic began to decline in the 1960s as trucking became the preferred mode of commercial transportation, and the last train ran on the elevated in 1980.\nIn 1999, a group of activists rallied to save the structure and convert it into a unique public space. This is how the Highline began. It offers unique views of the city, incredible art installations that change regularly, and a way to become a part of the history of the city.\nIn the spring and fall, this can be quite nice to\ndo with your partner\n. It can feel pretty romantic to walk along the Highline and take in the view hand in hand!\nOpen daily from 7 am to 10 pm, free.\nChelsea Market\nChelsea Market is an excellent spot for lunch or even just a snack if you choose to have brunch at Peak. It\u2019s got a wide variety of food stalls inside to choose from, with all sorts of great foods New York is known for.\nChelsea Market is housed in the former National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) factory complex, which was built in the 1890s. The building\u2019s architecture and industrial history make it an interesting and unique location for visitors. You\u2019ll find everything from gifts and flowers to home goods and gourmet specialty foods.\nGet a haircut, find the perfect bottle of wine, or catch an immersive art installation at\nArtechouse\n. Chelsea Market regularly hosts live music, sample sales, and other events.\nCheck here\nfor the latest events.\nLittle Island or Whitney Museum of American Art\nIf you\u2019re looking for a bit of time outside, head to Little Island. \u201cLittle Island is a public park and performance space in New York City. It is a relatively new addition to the city\u2019s parks and recreational spaces, officially opening to the public in May 2021. Little Island is situated on the Hudson River, near the Meatpacking District and Chelsea neighborhoods of Manhattan.\nThe park was funded by media mogul Barry Diller and his wife, fashion designer Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg, who were inspired by the idea of creating a unique public space on the Hudson River. Little Island is a popular destination for locals and tourists, offering a mix of nature, art, and entertainment in the heart of Manhattan. It has quickly become a beloved addition to New York City\u2019s cultural and recreational scene.\nIf you\u2019re interested in another museum, head to The Whitney Museum of Art. The Whitney Museum of American Art, often referred to simply as the Whitney, is a renowned museum in New York City dedicated to showcasing American art from the 20th and 21st centuries. It was founded by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, an art patron and collector, in 1930.\nThe museum has undergone several relocations and expansions over the years and is currently located in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan. The Whitney\u2019s collection includes a wide range of American art, from paintings and sculptures to multimedia installations, photography, and works on paper. The collection features works by prominent American artists, both historical and contemporary.\nBroadway\nNo trip to New York is complete without seeing a show on Broadway. When buying Broadway tickets, be aware of the show\u2019s schedule, seating options, pricing, and any special promotions or discounts available.\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to purchase tickets well in advance, especially for popular or high-demand shows. Lastly, watch out for any potential scams or fraudulent ticket sales and buy from reputable sources to ensure you receive valid tickets for the show you want to see.\nYou can find Broadway tickets through various sources, both online and in person. Here are some common ways to purchase Broadway tickets:\nOfficial Broadway Websites: Many Broadway shows have official websites where you can buy tickets directly. These websites often provide information about show schedules, ticket availability, and pricing. Popular official ticketing websites include Telecharge and Ticketmaster.\nOnline Ticketing Platforms: You can purchase Broadway tickets through popular online ticketing platforms such as Ticketmaster, Telecharge, Broadway.com, TodayTix, and StubHub. These platforms provide a convenient way to browse shows, view seat availability, and make online bookings.\nDiscount Ticket Services: There are several services that offer discounted Broadway tickets, including TKTS and TodayTix. TKTS has a physical booth in Times Square, another at South Street Seaport, and a mobile app that provides same-day discounted tickets for many Broadway and Off-Broadway shows.\nTheater Box Offices: You can visit the box office of the specific theater where the show is playing to buy tickets in person. This is often the best option if you want to purchase tickets on the day of the show or if you prefer the personal touch of speaking to a box office representative.\nTicket Resellers: Be cautious when using ticket resellers or third-party sellers. While some legitimate resellers like StubHub exist, be wary of scalpers and buy from reputable sources to avoid scams and counterfeit tickets.\nLotteries and Rush Tickets: Some shows offer lottery systems where you can enter for a chance to purchase discounted tickets. Rush tickets are also often available at the box office on the day of the show, usually at a lower price. These options are particularly popular for popular or sold-out shows.\nDiscount Websites: Websites like BroadwayBox and Goldstar offer discounted tickets for Broadway shows. They may have special promo codes to help you save on ticket prices.\nSubscription Services: Consider subscription services like Broadway.com\u2019s Season Ticketing, which allows you to purchase tickets for a series of Broadway shows at a discounted rate.\nHotels and Packages: Some hotels in New York City offer packages that include Broadway tickets along with your stay. These packages can be convenient and offer some cost savings.\nDay 3: Lower Manhattan, Lower East Side or Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn\nIn Lower Manhattan, you will find the 911 Memorial and Wall Street. After the morning there, spend your afternoon eating to your heart\u2019s content on a\nLower East Side food tour\n. This part of the city has some of the most iconic/amazing food in NY. Stop by the Brooklyn Bridge when you\u2019re done.\nPhoto purchased from Shutterstock\n911 Memorial and Museum\nThe 9/11 Memorial, also known as the National September 11 Memorial, is a solemn and poignant tribute to the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States. It serves as a place for remembrance, reflection, and commemoration.\nVisiting the outdoor 9/11 Memorial is free, but there is an admission fee to enter the museum. It\u2019s advisable to book museum tickets in advance, especially during peak tourist seasons, as it can get crowded.\nThe memorial plaza is generally open daily, and the museum\u2019s hours may vary. Be sure to check the official website for up-to-date information on opening hours and any special events.\nThe entrance fee into the\n9/11 Museum\nis well worth it, in my opinion. Visiting the 9/11 Memorial and Museum is a profoundly moving and meaningful experience. It allows visitors to remember and pay their respects to the lives lost on that tragic day and to learn about the historical and cultural significance of the World Trade Center site.\nIt\u2019s a place for reflection, unity, and honoring the bravery of first responders and all those affected by the events of 9/11.\nThis museum is included in the\nNew York Go City Sightseeing Pass\n.\nPhoto by\nRobert Bye\non\nUnsplash\nWall Street\nFrom the 9/11 Memorial, walk over to Wall Street. This is a historic street in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. It is famous for its association with the financial industry, including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Federal Hall National Memorial.\nWhile the interior of the NYSE is not open to the public, you can stand outside the iconic building at 11 Wall Street and take photos. You may also see traders and financial professionals entering and exiting the building.\nHere are a few sites worth seeing while on Wall Street.\nFederal Hall National Memorial: Federal Hall is a historic site where the first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated in 1789. The building now serves as a museum and visitor center, offering exhibitions about American government and finance history.\nThe Charging Bull: Located near Bowling Green, the Charging Bull is a famous bronze sculpture that has become a symbol of Wall Street. Visitors often take photos with this iconic artwork.\nTrinity Church: Trinity Church, located at the intersection of Wall Street and Broadway, is one of the oldest churches in New York City. The church and its historic cemetery are open to the public, and you can explore the church\u2019s beautiful architecture and learn about its history.\nLower East Side or Statue of Liberty\nLower East Side\nThe Lower East Side (LES) is a vibrant neighborhood located in the southeastern part of Manhattan, New York City. It has a rich history and is known for its diverse culture, artistic scene, and wide range of dining, shopping, and entertainment options.\nThe Lower East Side is famous for its diverse food scene.

It\u2019s advisable to plan your visit well in advance, especially during peak tourist seasons, to secure your preferred tour options and times.\nYou must purchase tickets in advance to visit the\nStatue of Liberty and Ellis Island\n. You can do this online through the official website of the National Park Service or through authorized vendors. There are various ticket options, including Crown access, Pedestal access, and Reserve tickets. Be sure to choose the one that suits your interests and preferences.\nFerries to Liberty Island and Ellis Island depart from Battery Park in Manhattan and Liberty State Park in New Jersey. Most visitors depart from Battery Park, which offers the closest proximity to the statue.\nUpon arrival on Liberty Island, you can explore the island and get up close to the Statue of Liberty. Take time to walk around, take photos, and enjoy the views of Manhattan and New Jersey from the island\u2019s grounds.\nMany tours include a visit to Ellis Island, which was once the primary immigrant processing station in the United States.

Restrooms and gift shops are also available on both islands.\nNote: Entry into the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island and many other things on this list are included in the\nNew York Go City Sightseeing Pass\n.

The Brooklyn Bridge connects Manhattan and Brooklyn, providing stunning views of the city skyline and the East River.\nWalking across the Brooklyn Bridge is a wonderful way to take in the city\u2019s beauty, experience a piece of its history, and enjoy the unique charm of both Manhattan and Brooklyn. It\u2019s a memorable and picturesque activity that you can easily combine with exploring the neighborhoods on either side of the bridge.\nThe bridge has a designated pedestrian walkway and a separate bike lane. Be mindful of cyclists and stay within the pedestrian area. You can rent bikes in Brooklyn or Manhattan if you prefer to bike across. It is approximately 1.1 miles (1.8 km) long and takes about 25-30 minutes to walk across leisurely. Plan some extra time for stops to take pictures and enjoy the views!\nWant other options?

It includes all the must-see sights and provides a pleasant mix of sightseeing and getting a taste of the local way of life. Ideal for making the most of a quick trip to New York City.\nReply\nThank you! Yes, it\u2019s important to make the most of your time when you have a shorter trip. Glad it was helpful!\nReply\nGreat itinerary!  Thank you for all your tips and suggestions.  We were able to accomplish so much in just a short three days.  We stayed in the Townplace that you recommended.  Very clean and nice hotel with a helpful staff and was a little more affordable than a stay in Manhatten, but I must say that my wife felt unsafe on more than one occasion from the three block walk from the 21st and Queensbridge Subway station to the hotel for anyone who is reading this and considering staying there on your trip.  Thankfully there were patrolmen walking on the sidewalk addressing some of the street fights that were taking place around us on our walk back to the Subway.  Thankfully nothing happened to us on any occasion and we enjoyed our getaway to NYC.\nReply\nI\u2019m so glad that you were able to use this to have a fantastic trip! Thanks for the safety tips, NYC is a big city and safety is always a priority.\nReply\nI appreciate you providing such a thorough and well-planned three-day schedule for New York City! Your recommendations are ideal for getting the most out of a brief stay. I am collecting notes for my trip and love the combination of must-see monuments and local favourites.\nReply\nYou\u2019re welcome! Yes, making the most of short time while there is key.\nReply\nLooking for a 3-5 day NYC. I like the 3 day itinerary but making it 5 days would seem a little better to get everything in\u2026Im 61 and will be bringing my 14yr old son. Not sure of how I want to get there but it will be plan, train ride or bus ride from Wilmington NC\u2026 looking for the cheapest hotels\nReply\nYes, 3 days can be pretty tight! I think that 5 days is a great amount of time to spend. Hotels in NYC can be really pricey but I recommend looking in some of the areas I suggest or even in New Jersey for something cheaper. You would need a longer train ride to get into the city though. Have an amazing trip!!\nReply\nRead our Privacy Policy\n\u00a9 2024 Meghan The Traveling Teacher | Design by\nLife in Color Designs"}]}

There is so much to do and see, that it can be frustrating trying to fit it all into one trip, especially if you only have 4 days in New York.\nI grew up in the suburbs, just 30 minutes outside of New York City, and have now lived here for many years. I think it\u2019s safe to say that I consider myself a local at this point.\nBefore you dive in, I want to caveat this post by saying that I\u2019ve put off writing a new york city itinerary for years since there are just so many things to do in this hectic city that I call home, that this kind of itinerary can be different for everyone. Instead, what I\u2019ve put together is a mix of my favorite tourist highlights as well as the best cheap hole-in-the-wall restaurants, exactly how I\u2019d like to spend 4 days in New York.\nKeep on reading to discover my local\u2019s guide to spending 4 days in NYC! You can mix and match the days below to fit any itinerary, especially if you have more time to explore.\nWhat to Pack for 4 Days in New York\nWhat you pack for a 4 day trip to New York is going to greatly depend on which season you are visiting. However, regardless of the season, there are a few essentials that should always be on your list.\nGood walking shoes\n\u2013 NY is a walking city, so you can expect to spend a good portion of your four days in New York doing a ton of walking. Make sure you have practical shoes for long days of exploring. I love my Birkenstocks for summer.\nExternal battery pack\n\u2013 this itinerary is jam-packed, so the last thing that you\u2019ll want is for your cell phone battery to run out halfway through the day. An\nexternal battery pack\nis a must for any trip to NY, or really just about any trip you take.\nVersatile outfits\n\u2013 when you\u2019re packing for New York, you\u2019ll want to think about outfits that can be dressed up or down, by throwing over a jean jacket or popping on some heels. The same dress could be worn casually for a day of exploring, and then dressed up for a night out in the city.\nSweater or light jacket\n\u2013 no matter what the season, you\u2019re looking to want to pack layers. Even during the summers, rooftops can get chilly in the evenings if the wind picks up.\nBackpack\n\u2013 I always recommend packing a good bag or backpack for any trip to NYC. As I mentioned, the days on my 4 day New York itinerary are long, so you\u2019ll want to be able to carry around everything you need. My go-to is my\nPatagonia day pack.\nCamera\n\u2013 NYC is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Don\u2019t miss out on an opportunity to snap some photos. I have the\nSony a7ii\nand I love it!\nBefore you dive in, make sure out some of the most popular tours in NYC:\n1 Day New York Sightseeing Tour\nSUMMIT One Experience\nEdge Observation Deck Admission\nNew York Helicopter Tour\n9/11 Memorial Museum Admission Ticket\nItinerary for 4 Days in New York City\nNew York Itinerary Day 1: Exploring from Midtown to Uptown\n4 Day NYC Itinerary: Top of the Rock\nView from Top of the Rock in NYC\nTop of the Rock\nStart the morning of your first of 4 days in New York at\nTop of the Rock\n. It\u2019s admittedly super touristy and a bit expensive, but it is so worth it for the views.\nI recommend booking your tickets ahead of time and arriving right when it opens, usually around 8am, to beat the crowds.\nThe Empire State Building\nThe\nEmpire State Building\nis another good alternative, with the newly renovated 102nd floor, but Top of the Rock has slightly better views in my opinion (as you can see the Empire State Building). If you\u2019re looking to\nbook a visit to the Empire State Building\n, then you\u2019ll want to do the 86th and 102nd floor combo, with tickets priced at $75.\nBook your tickets here\n| Visiting a lot of attractions in New York?\n\ud83e\uddfe With the\nNew York Explorer Pass by Go City\nyou get access to your favorite 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 10 attractions or tours, from over 95 things to do, and save up to 40% (compared to buying individual attraction tickets). Admire sweeping views from the Empire State Building Observatory, Top of the Rock, Edge and One World Observatory. See the city from a Hop on Hop off Bus, or take a Sightseeing Cruise. There\u2019s something for everyone!\nEmpire State Building 102nd Floor\nView from the Empire State Building\nGrand Central Station, Bryant Park, and New York Public Library\nBacktrack a bit after your early morning to explore a number of NYC musts:\nGrand Central Station, Bryant Park,\nand the\nNew York Public Library\n. While it would make sense to stop here before heading a bit north to Top of the Rock or the Empire State Building, I recommend visiting these top attractions early, and then you can backtrack if you want to avoid the crowds. Otherwise you can start your morning here and make your way Uptown.\nTimes Square\nWhile you\u2019re in Midtown, this is also a good opportunity for a quick stop in\nTimes Square\n. Most locals avoid Times Square at all costs, unless they are going to a Broadway performance. That being said, it is an iconic New York City spot that you shouldn\u2019t miss. If you have the opportunity to return in the late evening, when the city is lit up, I definitely recommend it.\nPhoto credit: Booking.com\n1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge\nA gorgeous hotel in Brooklyn\u2019s charming DUMBO neighborhood? Check. A rooftop pool with the perfect Manhattan skyline view? Check. An incredible restaurant and bar? Check. 1 Hotel is my go-to NYC hotel stay.\nCheck rates and availability\nMuseum of Modern Art (MoMa)\nMy absolute favorite museum in NYC is the\nMuseum of Modern Art (MoMa)\nso I would definitely stop here next if you\u2019re interested in art. If you\u2019re visiting during winter then it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to warm up a bit inside. Make sure to check out the gift shop as well for some unique souvenirs. Another great option is the\nMetropolitan Museum of Art.\nBook your tickets here\nCentral Park during Fall\nBoat Rides in Central Park\nCentral Park\nThe next stop on the first day of your 4 days in New York is\nCentral Park\n. Central Park is one of my absolute favorites places in NYC. It is truly enjoyable in any season. You could spend all day exploring Central Park, whether you\u2019re basking in the sun or taking in the fall foliage, but here are a few tips:\nEnter at 5th Avenue (just across from\nThe Plaza Hotel\n) and wander around\nThe Pond\nand\nGapstow Bridge\nFrom here, make your way North towards\nBethesda Fountain\nand\nBow Bridge\nIf the weather allows, go for a boat ride at the\nLoeb Boathouse\n($15 cash + $20 cash deposit for 1 hour)\nIf you\u2019re planning on laying out or having a picnic, I recommend\nSheep\u2019s Meadow\nThere aren\u2019t many public bathrooms in Central Park. but if you need to go you\u2019ll one a public restroom right behind Le Pain Quotidien, located by Sheep\u2019s Meadow\nUpper West Side\nOnce you\u2019ve had your fill of Central Park, make you way to the\nUpper West Side\nfor a stroll and a meal. My personal favorites include\nThe Mermaid Inn, Han Dynasty\n, and the famous\nCarmine\u2019s Restaurant\n(if you\u2019re traveling with a group). The Mermaid Inn is great for a drink and a great oyster happy hour. Han Dynasty is a classic Chinese restaurant, great for family style meals. And Carmine\u2019s is a NYC classic, with oversized portions great for any celebrations. Their penne alla vodka is unbeatable!\u00a0If you\u2019re on a budget that you\u2019ll find a list of the best\ncheap eats in NYC\nhere.\nNew York Itinerary Day 2: Brooklyn\nBrooklyn Bridge\nNo 4 day trip to New York City is complete without a walk across the\nBrooklyn Bridge\n\u2013 but do yourself a favor and do it early! This is one of the best\nfree things to do in New Yor\nk! The bridge gets extremely busy during the day, both with tourists and New York locals. Arrive shortly after sunrise (or during for great views), and you\u2019ll find a relatively empty bridge. Both of these shots were taken shortly after sunrise. Although the views are slightly better walking towards Manhattan, I recommend starting on the NYC side and making your way across to Brooklyn. You can always turn around for Downtown Manhattan views.\nFor the easiest access take the 4/5/6 subway to Brooklyn Bridge \u2013 City Hall station. If you\u2019re starting on the Brooklyn side then take the F to York street station. Make sure to watch out for bikers and commuters while on the path!\nWalk across the Brooklyn Bridge\nThe Brooklyn Bridge at sunrise\nDUMBO\nOnce across the bridge you can explore\nDUMBO\n, a neighborhood named after its location down under the Manhattan Bridge overpass. Head to Washington and Water St to snap a photo at the\nfamous NYC Instagram spot\n, before wandering down to the water.\nYou\u2019ll find some great spots to eat in DUMBO, such as the\nTime Out Market\nand\nGrimaldi\u2019s Pizza\n. Even if you don\u2019t want to eat there, I recommend heading to the\nrooftop at the Time Out Market\nfor some excellent views of the bridge (free to access). Another great rooftop is the\nOne Hotel.\nThe drinks are on the pricier end but well worth it for the excellent views!\nWashington Street in DUMBO, Brooklyn\nDUMBO, Brooklyn\nBrooklyn Heights + Cobble Hill\nOnce you\u2019ve had your fill of DUMBO, continue walking down the water through\nBrooklyn Bridge Park\nto experience neighborhoods of Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill for some Brooklyn charm. Admire the Brooklyn brownstones and the neighborhood shops on Court and Smith streets. A few highlights in the area include:\nDrinks in Brooklyn:\nElsa Cocktail Bar\n(handcrafted cocktails and excellent wine)\nBlack Mountain Wine House\n(cozy cabin vibes with an excellent, and affordable, wine selection)\nSwallow Cafe\n(hot drinks and treats for an afternoon pick me up)\nFood in Brooklyn:\nLucali Pizza\n(one of NYC\u2019s best pizza spots \u2013 arrive right when it opens to snag a seat)\nColonie\n(my favorite restaurant in NYC, you need to order the Sticky Date cake)\nBrooklyn Farmacy & Soda Fountain\n(extravagant ice cream sundaes with old time Brooklyn charm)\nVinny\u2019s of Carroll Gardens\n(classic, no-frills Italian food)\nSahadi\u2019s\n(international market with an excellent prepared foods section)\nBrooklyn Heights in Brooklyn, NY\nCobble Hill in Brooklyn, NY\nWilliamsburg\nNext stop is Brooklyn\u2019s trendiest neighborhood:\nWilliamsburg\n. Hop on the G train and scoot on over to Williamsburg. There\u2019s plenty to do in Williamsburg, whether you\u2019re checking out the shops, looking for a snack, or grabbing a drink. You can definitely spend an afternoon exploring the trendy coffee shops and boutique stores, but I definitely recommend a night out in Williamsburg as well! One item that must be on your Williamsburg itinerary is a slice of pizza from\nJoe\u2019s Pizza\n. A true new yorker knows that nothing can compete with a New York slice of pizza. I recommend the Sicilian, or staying traditional with a \u201cplain slice\u201d.\nEnjoying Joe\u2019s Pizza\nExploring Williamsburg in Brooklyn, NY\nIf you\u2019re visiting during the warmer months and happen to be in the area on a Saturday then I recommend checking out\nSmorgasburg\nfor a fun dining experience. Just make sure that you save\nroom for dessert.\nFrom here you can shop for some local goods at\nArtists & Fleas\n. If not, no worries! Here is a list of some of my favorite spots in the area:\nBrooklyn Brewery\n(a taste of a local brewery)\nCafe Mogador\n(Moroccan restaurant \u2013 perfect for any meal but brunch is a personal fave)\nRadegast Hall & Biergarten\n(perfect for groups and casual beers)\nFresh Kills Bar\n(come for the happy hour cocktails)\nBerry Park\n(the perfect Williamsburg rooftop bar + restaurant)\nSunset views in Lower Manhattan\n4 Days in New York City: Day 3 Exploring Downtown Manhattan\nThere is so much to do in Downtown Manhattan that it definitely deserves it\u2019s own day on this 4 days in New York itinerary.\nThe Vessel\nStart your 3rd day of exploring at one NYC\u2019s newer attractions:\nThe Vessel\n. While same-day tickets are available, I recommend\nbooking them ahead of time online\n.\nOnce you\u2019ve had your fill of the interactive art exhibit (I still don\u2019t quite get it) and the neighboring Hudson Yards mall, make your way to the\nHigh Line\n. The High Line, a park on a raised subway track, is easily one of my favorite things to do in New York in any season, and always the first thing that I recommend to anyone visiting New York.\nThe Vessel \u2013 a must on any 4 day New York itinerary\nEarly mornings at the Vessel\nHigh Line\nMake your way down the High Line until you reach\nChelsea Market\n. This is the perfect spot to stop for a snack and shop, with a number of boutique shops and restaurants. Once you\u2019re recharged, head over to the\nWhitney Museum\n. This is must for any art lovers. Plus, the roofdeck views of the city and the Hudson River are perfect.\nWander through the trendy\nMeatpacking District\nand then continue to\nGreenwich Village\nand the\nWest Village\n\u2014 exploring the cute neighborhoods and storefronts. If you don\u2019t have time to add a trip to Williamsburg to your NYC itinerary, then you have a second chance at grabbing a slice of my favorite,\nJoe\u2019s Pizza\n, in the West Village.\nWashington Square Park at sunrise\nWest Village, NY\nSoHo\nBe sure to stop by\nWashington Square Park\nfor a classic NYC experience, before heading downtown a little further to SoHo.\nSoHo\nis fun for shopping and small cobblestone streets. For a high-end dining experience in SoHo I recommend a meal at Balthazar. The menu is $$$ but an amazing meal to splurge on.\nVisiting Chinatown during 4 days in New York\nDining at Souvlaki GR on the Lower East Side\nFor those of you who aren\u2019t splurging at Balthazar, finish you day with dinner in\nChinatown, the East\nVillage\n, or\nthe LES\n\u2013 all fun, local areas. For a cheap, delicious meal in Chinatown I recommend the following:\nNom Wah Tea Parlor\n(oldest dim sum parlor in NYC \u2013 be sure to check out the speakeasy next door as well)\nVanessa\u2019s Dumpling\n(a great spot for cheap takeout dumplings)\nA few of my favorite spots in the East Village/LES include the following:\nJajaja Mexican (I never knew how good vegan Mexican could be)\nSouvlaki GR (transport yourself to Santorini with this hidden Greek gem)\nPanna ii (where Christmas lights meet chili peppers.. and Indian food)\nIf you\u2019re sticking around the area to check out some bars, then I recommend the following spots:\nLois (East Village)\nPianos (LES)\nPlease Don\u2019t Tell (East Village)\nTen Degrees (East Village)\nA Local\u2019s Guide to NYC: Exploring (Way) Downtown Manhattan\nAlthough most locals avoid way downtown Manhattan, other than to go to the office, there are some great things to see. Take the subway (or walk) down to Wall Street and wander the streets a bit to get a taste of New York\u2019s Financial District (FiDi) and the New York Stock Exchange. Choices for food can be a bit limited in this area, but you can never go wrong with a meal at\nWestville\n. Classic dishes at reasonable prices, plus a great happy hour at the Wall St location.\nI definitely recommend checking out the One World Trade (Freedom Tower), as well as the 9/11 Memorial and Museum if time permits.\nWander down to Battery Park.\nPro tip:\nfrom here you can take the Staten Island Ferry for a very cheap way to see the Statue of Liberty up close\nViews of the Freedom Tower\nEvening views of Lower Manhattan\nA Local\u2019s Guide to Queens\nI know that I\u2019ve already used up my 4 days in New York, but as someone who has lived and worked in the area, it would feel wrong to not include it. While not the most famous parts of a NYC itinerary, you\u2019ll find some hidden gems in both\nLong Island City\nand\nAstoria\n.\nWith so many awesome local breweries, I recommend enjoying a self-guided brewery tour.\nBig aLICe\nRockaway Brewing\nFifth Hammer\nLIC Beer Project\nDutch Kills (for cocktails)\nBreakfast in Long Island City at Blackstar Bakery\nBig aLICe brewery in Long Island City, NY\nJust North of Long Island City you\u2019ll also find the hidden gem of\nAstoria\n.

I went to graduate school in New Jersey and Tim and I would frequently day trip into the city. Since then, we try to visit New York City once a year, simply because we love this city. In fact, we even started and ended our\naround the world trip\nright here. To me, New York feels more like home than Baltimore, the city where I was born and raised.\nIn general, I grouped sites together based on their location in order to save you time walking and using public transportation. This will keep you from spending unnecessary time on the subway and from backtracking through the city.\nYou can do these days in any order.\nThe provided walking distances are the amount of walking you will do to get between sites. These do not include the amount of walking you will do inside of museums, art galleries, etc.\nI do my best to keep the hours of operation and pricing up to date for each attraction, however, these can change at any time. I recommend getting updated hours and pricing for your dates of travel. The link to the official website is provided for each site.\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nNew York City Itinerary: Day 1\nOne World Trade Center, the 9/11 Memorial, Staten Island Ferry, and SoHo\nWalking distance: 1 mile plus 0.5 to 1 miles in SoHo\nHow to Use This Map:\nClick the tab in the top left corner of the map to see a list of the points of interest and to turn layers on/off.

This skyscraper stands next to the footprints of the original World Trade Center buildings that were destroyed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\nThe One World Observatory, which is the observation deck on One World Trade Center, is a great place to take in your first view of New York City. From here, you have awesome views of Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and New Jersey. Plus, by being here early in the day, you get to beat the crowds and have a more pleasant experience.\nView from One World Observatory | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nView looking east from One World Observatory | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nRead about the entire experience and get tips on purchasing tickets in our post:\nHow to Visit One World Observatory\nI recommend buying your tickets online in advance.\nIf you purchase tickets\nonline in advance\n, you will skip the ticket line but could still wait in line for the elevator to the Observatory.

The 9/11 Memorial Plaza is an 8-acre park where the World Trade Center Twin Towers once stood. The foundations of the Twin Towers have been converted into reflecting pools and the surrounding area is now a grove of trees.\n9/11 Memorial and the Oculus | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\n9/11 Memorial Museum\nAt the 9/11 Memorial Museum, learn about the story of 9/11 through a series of exhibits, artifacts, and interactive technology.\nWebsite:\nwww.911memorial.org\nEntrance Ticket:\nEntry tickets can also be purchased through\nGetYourGuide.\nThe Oculus\nThe Oculus, also called the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, is a brand new, state-of-the-art train station. It sits right around the corner from the World Trade Center. You know you are in the right spot when you see the brilliantly white, space-aged looking structure.\nThe Oculus | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nThe Oculus opened in March 2016. It connects the PATH (trains from Newark and Hoboken, New Jersey) to the New York City subway system. It is also a shopping mall and a place to grab a bite to eat.\nIt\u2019s worth a quick visit and it\u2019s free!\nLunch at Pisillo Italian Panini\nTwo blocks from the Oculus is a great little Italian sandwich shop. This is popular lunch spot for locals and business people working in the area. These sandwiches are enormous and can be split between two people.\nWall Street\nOn your way to Battery Park, wander through the Financial District and take a stroll down Wall Street.\nStaten Island Ferry\nA ride on the Staten Island Ferry is one of New York City\u2019s best free things to do. During this ride, you have great views of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline.\nThe ferry leaves from the Staten Island Ferry terminal, next to Battery Park. Simply get in line and board the next ferry. The ferry is enormous, with multiple decks and inside and outside seating.\nI recommend taking a seat outside on the back of the ferry. From this point you can watch Manhattan slowly recede as you approach Staten Island. To your left will be the Statue of Liberty.\nView from the Staten Island Ferry | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nFerries leave every 30 minutes and are more frequent during rush hour. A one-way trip takes about 25 minutes.\nYou are not permitted to stay on the ferry and ride it round trip.\nOnce you are in Staten Island, exit the ferry, get back in line, and re-board the ferry. We were able to get right back onto the same ferry without having to wait for the next one (on a Monday morning in February).\nThe entire round trip ride takes about one hour.\nGet the full details about the Staten Island ferry on the official\nwebsite\n.\nSpend the Afternoon in SoHo\nSoHo is a neighborhood in Manhattan that is home to art galleries, trendy shops, and restaurants. It gets its name from its location \u201cSouth of Houston Street.\u201d\nSpend the afternoon wandering and shopping here.\nTo get to SoHo from the Staten Island Ferry Terminal using the subway, walk to the Whitehall Street Station. Take the R line four stations uptown to Prince Street.\nFor dinner, we highly recommend\nPiccola Cucina Osteria.\nThis tiny restaurant serves traditional Sicilian food. We have eaten in Little Italy many times but this restaurant is so much better than any place in Little Italy. The food is amazing. It\u2019s a small place so I recommend\nmaking a reservation in advance\n.\nSoho | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nFor dessert, you have two options in the area. Just across the street from Piccola Cucina Osteria is\nDominique Ansel Bakery\n. This bakery has unique desserts\u2026how about trying a cookie baked in the shape of a cup and filled with milk? Yum!\nOne block from Piccola Cucina Osteria is\nBlack Tap\n, a restaurant that is legendary for its gigantic milkshakes topped with cookies, brownies, and even slices of pie. If you want to take a cool food photo on Instagram during your trip to NYC, this is a good place to put on your list. Expect to wait in line for at least 30 minutes.\nNew York City Itinerary: Day 2\nArt Museums, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square\nWalking distance: 4 miles plus Central Park (an additional 2 to 4 miles)\nTake Your Pick from Four Art Museums\nThere are a bunch of fabulous art museums in Manhattan.

See\nThe Starry Night\nby Van Gogh,\nThe Persistence of Memory\nby Dali, and works of art by Matisse, Monet, and Picasso.\nWebsite:\nwww.moma.org\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art\nThe Met is enormous. It\u2019s so big that you can measure the size of this museum in acres (13 acres!!). Come see one of the best collections of ancient art from all around the world.\nMetropolitan Museum of Art | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nWebsite:\nwww.metmuseum.org\nThe Guggenheim Museum\nThis is another modern art museum. The building, which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is also a work of modern art.\nInside the Guggenheim | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nWebsite:\nwww.guggenheim.org\nThe Frick Collection\nSee world-class art by Vermeer, Renoir, and Rembrandt in a beautifully designed residence.\nIMPORTANT:\nThe Frick Collection is currently closed for a renovation project although it is planned to reopen late in 2024. The works of art were relocated to a temporary location, called the Frick Madison, which is in the Marcel Breuer-designed modernist building at 945 Madison Avenue. Learn more\nhere.\nWebsite:\nwww.frick.org\nLunch\nWhere you choose to have lunch depends upon the art museum you visit. If you chose the MoMA, here are two recommendations:\nPatsy\u2019s Italian Restaurant:\nThis family-owned restaurant has been in business since 1944. Frank Sinatra made this place famous and many other celebrities have dined here, including Ben Stiller, Tom Hanks, Oprah Winfrey, James Gandolfini, and many more. I recommend the Eggplant Parmesan (it was the best I ever had!).\nThe Black Tap:\nThis restaurant serves craft burgers and beer but it\u2019s famous for its over-the-top milkshakes topped with brownies, cookies, and slices of cake and pie (mentioned under Day 1 as a dessert destination near SoHo).\nIf you picked one of the other art museums, explore the area around the museum for lunch spots.\nCentral Park\nCentral Park is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world. Therefore a visit to New York City would not be complete without at least a quick stroll through part of the park.\nCentral Park is much more than a tourist destination. For New Yorkers, this is a treasured green space, a spot to lie out in the sun, go for a run, and take the kids to the playground.\nSpend part of the afternoon exploring Central Park. You can simply wander through it on your own two feet, rent bikes and cycle a lap or two through the entire park, or do something very touristy and go for a horse and carriage ride. There are numerous places to rent bikes just outside of the park. We have the best luck one block south of the park around 5th and 6th avenue. You can also rent bikes in advance\nhere.\nThe Mall | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nCentral Park in mid-April | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nNotable spots to visit in Central Park are the Imagine Mosaic at Strawberry Fields, Bow Bridge (one of the most photographed locations in the park), Belvedere Castle, Sheep Meadow, and The Mall.\nExplore Midtown Manhattan\nFor the rest of the afternoon, stroll through midtown Manhattan. From Central Park, pop into The Plaza, one of the most famous hotels in the world. Then stroll down Fifth Avenue until you get to St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.\nFifth Avenue\nSt. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nTop of the Rock Observation Deck or SUMMIT One Vanderbilt\nToday, take your pick between two observation decks: Top of the Rock and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt.\nOf the two, SUMMIT One Vanderbilt is our favorite. You get one of the best views of Manhattan and it is a very unique experience, with the mirrored rooms and immersive art installations. Top of the Rock is also very nice, but it doesn\u2019t beat the view from SUMMIT. For photos of both, check out our\nGuide to NYC\u2019s Observation Decks.\nIf you choose Top of the Rock, the best time to visit it is now, since it is located on top of Rockefeller Center. If you choose SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, plan your visit for the end of the day, when you are near Grand Central Terminal.\nTime your visit an hour before sunset for the best experience.\nFrom Top of the Rock, you get a great view of New York City from Midtown Manhattan. To the north you see Central Park, Harlem, and the Bronx. To the south, you not only get to see the Empire State Building, but you also get to see the towering skyscrapers of the financial district (and One World Trade Center) off in the distance.\nView from Top of the Rock in February 2018, before One Vanderbilt was constructed.\nWhile in the area, you can also take a tour of Rockefeller Center and\nRadio City Music Hall\n. Just note, if you do choose to take a tour, you will have to skip most of the activities planned this afternoon.\nTimes Square\nFrom Rockefeller Center, it\u2019s just a five-minute walk to iconic, crowded, chaotic, touristy Times Square.\nTimes Square | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nThis is one of the most famous intersections in the world. Every New Year\u2019s Eve, thousands people gather to watch the ball drop, making this the most famous place in the world to welcome in the New Year. During the other 364 days of the year, Times Square is almost as crowded, as street performers put on shows and visitors from around the world gawk at the millions of lights that adorn the neon billboards.\nIt seems like Times Square is always changing. Every year, there are bigger and better billboards, new stores designed to draw visitors in, and crazier street performers on the streets. It is a crowded, overwhelming place and not everyone enjoys this experience. Take as long (or as little) as you like in this dazzling, gaudy place.\nPRO TRAVEL TIP:\nIf this is your first time in New York City, it\u2019s worth seeing Times Square in the daytime and at nighttime. It really is neat to see all lit up at night.\nNew York Public Library and Grand Central Station\nThere are just a few more spots to visit on this very busy afternoon. From Times Square, walk to Bryant Park and the New York Public Library. The library is free and it is worth a quick visit. It\u2019s a beautiful building on the inside and has been featured in popular movies such as \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d \u201cThe Day after Tomorrow,\u201d and \u201cSex and the City.\u201d\nRose Reading Room the the NYC Public Library\nA few blocks from the library is Grand Central Terminal. This is the largest train station in the world, with 44 train platforms. The Main Concourse is a gorgeous spot to visit. Walk up the steps to the Apple Store and watch the show as hundreds of people crisscross the Main Concourse.\nGrand Central Terminal | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nInside of Grand Central Terminal is the Grand Central Market. This is a small market but it is a great place to put together a meal. With fresh fruits, pastas, cheese, and wine, you have the option to assemble a picnic dinner here.\nSUMMIT One Vanderbilt\nOne Vanderbilt is the fourth tallest building in Manhattan. On the top three levels of One Vanderbilt is SUMMIT, New York City\u2019s newest observation deck. The views are spectacular but SUMMIT One Vanderbilt takes the experience to a whole different level. On these three floors is a state-of-the-art, fully immersive experience with art installations, mirrored rooms, glass sky boxes, and a glass elevator.\nSUMMIT One Vanderbilt | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nTickets start at $43 and a visit here typically lasts 2 hours. In my opinion, the best time to visit SUMMIT One Vanderbilt is an hour before sunset.\nSUMMIT One\nHow to Visit SUMMIT One Vanderbilt: Photos, Tips & Is It Worth It?\nEverything you need to know to visit SUMMIT One Vanderbilt.\nEnd the day with dinner and drinks. If you like the idea of Japanese food, consider going to Momosan Ramen & Sake, just a few blocks from Grand Central Terminal and One Vanderbilt.\nNew York City Itinerary: Day 3\nThe Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Tenement Museum & a Food Tour\nThe Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island\nIf it\u2019s your first time in New York, the Statue of Liberty is a must see. You can visit just the Statue of Liberty or you can visit the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island together as a round trip excursion from Manhattan.\nStatue of Liberty | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nAt the Statue of Liberty, you can climb the base of the statue or go all of the way to the crown. Both of these options require advance tickets, and they do sell out, so make sure you book your tickets well in advance.\nEllis Island was an immigrant inspection station and approximately 12 million immigrants were processed here between 1905 and 1954.\nEllis Island | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nLiberty Island (the location of the Statue of Liberty) and Ellis Island are connected by ferry with Battery Park (on Manhattan).\nThe entire visit, from Battery Park to Liberty Island and Ellis Island, and then back to Battery Park, takes about 4 to 6 hours.\nYou will take a ferry from Battery Park to Liberty Island. After seeing the Statue of Liberty, catch the next ferry to Ellis Island and tour this island. Then take a ferry back to Battery Park.\nPRO TRAVEL TIP:\nTickets tend to sell out in advance. As soon as you know your travel dates, consider booking your Statue of Libery tickets.\nCost:\nTickets start at $25\nHours:\nFerries depart from Battery Park from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm\nWebsite:\nBook your tickets in advance on\nwww.statuecruises.com\nPowered by\nGetYourGuide\nTenement Museum\nNow that you learned about what it was like to be an immigrant arriving in the United States, continue the experience with a visit to the Tenement Museum. Located on the Lower East Side, learn about what it was like to live as an immigrant between the 19th and 21st centuries.\nNumerous tours are offered. Visit the Tenement Museum\nwebsite\nfor full details.\nTo get to the Tenement Museum from Battery Park, walk to the Broad Street station and take line J uptown four stations to Delancey St/Essex St (8 minutes).\nTake a Food Tour in Manhattan\nLittle Italy and Chinatown are places that are frequently listed in guidebooks. For years, we loved spending an afternoon wandering through Chinatown or dining at a restaurant in Little Italy. However, in recent years, things have changed. Now, most of the restaurants in Little Italy are mediocre, overpriced restaurants that are well worth skipping. On our most recent visit to New York, Tim and I stopped into one of these restaurants for a drink and even the wine was mediocre.\nLittle Italy | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nIf you are curious about Little Italy and Chinatown, they are still worth a quick visit. But you should know that there are much better places in New York for quality Italian and Chinese food.\nA better way to spend the afternoon is to take a food tour in Manhattan.\nThis\n2-hour walking food tour of Hell\u2019s Kitchen\ngets rave reviews. If you like the idea of combining a walking tour with a food tour of Greenwich Village, I recommend taking a look at\nthis tour.\nFinally, on this\n3-hour food tour on the Lower East Side\nyou will sample German, Dutch, Italian, Chinese, and Jewish dishes and hear stories about the immigrants who settled here.\nNIGHTLIFE IN MANHATTAN:\nIf you want to go out for drinks, we recommend\nDeath & Company.\nThis speak-easy bar serves amazing craft cocktails. They also sell several cocktail books. We love\nCocktail Codex\n(it\u2019s an essential cocktail book if you like to make mixed drinks). Their book called\nDeath & Company: Modern Classic Cocktails\nalso gets stellar reviews, but the recipes call for very specific liquors and infusions, and you would have to have a very well-stock bar to make many of these drinks.\nNew York City Itinerary: Day 4\nBrooklyn\nWalking distance: 4 miles\nBrooklyn is becoming one of New York City\u2019s hot spots to visit. With historic neighborhoods, a fabulous food scene, and some of the best views of the Manhattan skyline, this is a great place to add to your New York City itinerary.\nSince Brooklyn is so large, it\u2019s impossible to visit all of it in just one day. With just one day you can visit the neighborhood of Williamsburg and the areas along the East River. Think of today as a mini food tour combined with some of the best views of Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge.\nDumbo (Down under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass)\nWilliamsburg, Brooklyn | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nWalking across the Brooklyn Bridge\nThe day starts in Williamsburg, a wonderful neighborhood with boutique shops, a variety of restaurants, and the Brooklyn Brewery. Then, take a ferry on the East River to Dumbo and the Brooklyn Bridge. From here, enjoy one of the best views of the Manhattan skyline, dine on the best pizza in the city, and end with a walk over the iconic Brooklyn Bridge.\nGet the full details in our article:\nOne Perfect Day in Brooklyn\nNew York City Itinerary: Day 5\nEmpire State Building, Chelsea Market, the High Line & Hudson Yards\nWalking distance 3 miles (if you include the option to visit Greenwich Village)\nEmpire State Building\nStart the day with a trip up the Empire State Building. Completed in 1931, this was the tallest building in the world for 40 years until the North Tower of the World Trade Center was completed in 1970. The Empire State Building has been featured in over 250 TV shows and movies and is listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.\nLooking north from the Empire State Building (June 2021).\nLooking south from the Empire State Building.\nIf you don\u2019t mind waking up early, you can watch the sunrise from the top of the Empire State Building. Tickets are limited to 100 visitors and need to be purchased in advance. It\u2019s pricey, costing $135 per person, and tickets are only available for Friday and Saturday mornings.\nCost:\nstandard tickets start at $44 for adults and $38 for children\nHours:\nVary be season. Get updated hours on the official website.\nWebsite:\nGet the full details on packages and VIP experiences on the official Empire State Building\nwebsite\n.\nGet Your Guide:\nYou can also\npurchase your entrance tickets in advance\nthrough GetYourGuide.\nPowered by\nGetYourGuide\nChelsea Market\nFrom the Empire State Building, visit Chelsea Market for lunch.\nThe Chelsea Market is food paradise!! This is one of our favorite places in Manhattan for lunch. Inside of the market are numerous small restaurants selling food from around the world. Our favorite restaurants are Los Tacos No. 1, the Lobster Place, and Takumi Taco. There are also a number of boutique shops if you like to go shopping.\nChelsea Market | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nHow to Get to Chelsea Market from the Empire State Building:\nFrom the Empire State Building, it is a 3-minute walk to the 34 St \u2013 Herald Square Subway Station. Take the D train (orange) towards Coney Island. At W 4 St \u2013 Washington Square, transfer to E train (blue) towards Jamaica Center. Exit at 14 St/8 Ave and walk one block to Chelsea Market. This takes 16 minutes. Or, take a taxi, Uber, or Lyft.\nOptional: 9/11 Museum Workshop\nOne block away from Chelsea Market is the Ground Zero Museum Workshop. This museum documents what life was like for the workers and firefighters at Ground Zero during the recovery effort. Filled with artifacts and photographs, this is a great museum to visit if you want to learn more about what it was like to be at the World Trade Center site after the terrorist attack. This is one of the most underrated museums in New York City and well worth your time.\n9/11 Museum Workshop | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nWebsite:\nLearn more about the museum\nhere.\nOptional: Greenwich Village\nSpend an hour or two in Greenwich Village. Greenwich Village was the location of the 60\u2019s counterculture movements and the modern LGBT movement. Now, the \u201cbohemian days\u201d are long gone, due to rising housing costs and gentrification of the neighborhood, but this is still a wonderful spot to visit.\nTo get the most out of your visit, this\nwalking tour of Greenwich Village\nsounds amazing. Learn where Jimi Hendrix and Edgar Allen Poe hung out, where one of Bob Dylan\u2019s album covers was photographed, and the rise of gay rights in New York City.\nThe High Line\nMid-afternoon, walk the High Line to Hudson Yards. This is a public park and elevated walking path that was built on a historic freight line.\nThe High Line\nIt\u2019s free to visit and one of Manhattan\u2019s prettiest walks.\u00a0The High Line starts near the Whitney Museum, but you can also get onto the High Line from Chelsea Market.\nIt takes about 30 minutes to walk from Chelsea Market to Hudson Yards.\nHudson Yards, the Vessel, & the Edge\nSpend the rest of the day in the ultra-modern Hudson Yards.\nWhat was once a storage yard and jumble of train tracks has evolved into Manhattan\u2019s newest ultra-modern neighborhood.\nThe trains and their tracks are still here, but this small city has been built on a state-of-the-art platform that is elevated above the railroad tracks. Glass-plated skyscrapers, a shopping mall, a performing arts theater, and two of Manhattan\u2019s very popular attractions, the Vessel and the Edge, can all be found here.\nThe Vessel\nThe Vessel is a futuristic art installation in Hudson Yards. After being closed for several years, it recently reopened at the end of 2024.\nThe Vessel | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nLEARN MORE:\nHow to Visit the Vessel\nThe Edge\nIn 2020, The Edge joined the growing number of observation decks in Manhattan. Hovering 100 floors above the city streets, this sky deck offers jaw-dropping views over Manhattan. Adding to the thrill is the glass floor, where you can peer down to the city streets far below.\nThe Edge | 5 Day New York City Itinerary\nThe best time to visit the Edge is at sunset. These tickets sell out in advance, so\nmake your reservations\nonce you know your dates of travel. If you can\u2019t get sunset tickets, you can arrive mid to late afternoon and stick around for sunset. I also recommend checking\nGetYourGuide,\nbecause they are an authorized ticket seller for Hudson Yards and they might have availability for your date and time.\nThere is also a new experience. Called\nCity Climb,\nyou wear a harness, climb up along the edge of the skyscraper, and view New York City from the highest observation deck in the city. This takes two hours and ends with a visit to the Edge. We did this in November 2021 and it is awesome! It\u2019s definitely the most thrilling view of Manhattan.

The New York City Subway is functional but it is dirty, smelly, and in great need of renovation work. It may not be pretty but it will get you where you need to go cheaply and efficiently.\nI recommend downloading the\nNYC Subway app\non your smartphone (it\u2019s free!). This is the app I use to find routes between destinations.\nI also recommend purchasing a\n7 Day Unlimited Ride Metrocard\n. It costs $34 and you can ride the subway an unlimited number of times in seven days (there is not a 5 day unlimited ride Metrocard). It costs $3.25 per ride on the metro. If you ride the metro 11 or more times (which you will do on this itinerary) the card pays for itself.\nHotel Recommendations\nFor more recommendations, take a look at our article\nWhere to Stay in New York City: Best Hotels and Neighborhoods for Your Budget.\nGet an overview of New York City\u2019s most popular neighborhoods with recommendations on where to stay in each of them.\nIf you have any questions about how to spend 5 days in New York City or how to plan your New York City itinerary, comment below!\nMore Information about New York City\nRead all of our articles about the USA in our\nUnited States Travel Guide.\nBest Observation Decks in NYC: Ranked by Price, Height & View\nViewing New York City from its tallest buildings is one of the city\u2019s best experiences.

The\niconic Central Park\nhas 842 acres of greenery, lakes, walking trails, and history.\nTake a guided walking tour or do it DIY to get acquainted with all there is to see and do here. Be sure to stop by the Bethesda Fountain, walk on the Mall, and stroll on the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir Running Path.\nVisit the Metropolitan Museum of Art-\nExit the park at 81st St. and 5th Avenue to enter\nthe Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nOpen 7 days per week from 9:30 \u2013 5:30 and 9PM on Fridays and Saturdays.\nWith only 2 days in the city, you can\u2019t possibly visit all the museums and attractions, but the Met is non-negotiable in my book. The morning is the best time to go because it may be less crowded. Find your favorite section or head for the current exhibit. Be sure to enjoy the architecture as well as the art in this magnificent and world renowned museum.\nBook a Walking Tour of Central Park Here\nAfternoon: Lunch at The Plaza & Rockefeller Center & Empire State Building\nLunch at The Plaza\n\u2013 When you leave the Met, walk south through the park and pass by the\nCentral Park Zoo\nand walk along 5th Avenue until you reach the famed\nPulitzer Fountain\nat\nGrand Army Plaza\n. Here, you\u2019ll enter the one and only\nPlaza Hotel\n.\nIf you can get a table in the main dining room,\nThe Palm Court\n, then do it! If not,\nThe Champagne Bar\nwill likely have a table and it is very lovely, with a great menu, perfect for your lunch at The Plaza with Eloise!\nVisit Rockefeller Center\n\u2013 After lunch, continue south on 5th Avenue for some window shopping until you hit 50th St. and see\nRockefeller Center\n.

Both these landmarks are gorgeous inside and out.\nThe Empire State Building\nhowever, requires tickets and time waiting in line, etc, so you may have to pass on this particular adventure for this trip, and catch it the next time!\nEvening: Midtown \u2013 Dinner in Times Square & Broadway Show\nTimes Square \u2013\nContinue on to 42nd St. & Broadway. You are now heading directly into Times Square.\nHold on to your hat, and be prepared for a crowded, loud, and busy scene!\nIf you\u2019ve never been, it can be a bit overwhelming. Everywhere you look will be filled with lights and sounds and street performers. You\u2019ll see where the ball drops at New Year\u2019s Eve, the famous billboards, and you can climb the steps above the\nTKTS\noffice to get a birds eye view of the square.\nDinner Before the Show\n\u2013\nDos Caminos at 47th St. & Broadway\nfor Mexican food.\nI always recommend this restaurant because the food is consistently great, there are always tables available, the prices are decent, and most of all because it\u2019s close to all the theaters. You can relax during dinner knowing that you\u2019re just steps away from your show.\nHead to the theater and enjoy the show! Check your tix for the show time, so you aren\u2019t late!\nAfter The Show\nEnjoy a New York tradition and have some drinks after the show.

This part of the city features historic landmarks like the\nStatue of Liberty\n,\nBattery Park\n, and the\nWorld Trade Center\n. I love how these neighborhoods blend modern skyscrapers with original cobblestone streets.\nThis full day downtown will give you a great taste of what there is to see and do in the lower part of the island.\nMorning: Battery Park & The Statue of Liberty & Financial District (FiDi)\nBattery Park\n\u2013 Head to Battery Park along the New York Harbor to see\nthe iconic\nStatue of Liberty\n. It\u2019s a special site to see for sure, but I don\u2019t think you need to take the time for the boat ride and tours during this brief visit.

It was later moved to the Bowling Green spot because members of the Stock Exchange complained. In 2017, the Fearless Girl was placed staring down the nose of the Charging Bull, but then Di Modica complained! So, the Girl was moved to the front of the Stock Exchange.\nAfternoon: Lunch at the Oculus &The 9/11 Memorial & Museum & Freedom Tower\nLunch at the Oculus\n\u2013 From the Charging Bull, take a 4 minute walk to the Oculus and the\n9/11 Memorial Plaza\n.

Yes, these neighborhoods are side by side and are a fun and uplifting compliment after visiting the Financial District.\nChinatown \u2013\nis centered between Mott Street, Bleecker Street, and Chatham Square. This is one of the oldest Chinatowns in the country. Expect to see many shops selling fruits and vegetables as well as fish and herbs. You may be approached by people selling handbags and other random items. Don\u2019t ever feel obligated to purchase anything if you don\u2019t want to. But take the opportunity to buy souvenirs if you choose.\nLittle Italy \u2013\nis centered around Mulberry St., adjacent to Chinatown. The large concentration of Italian immigrants moved here in the 1840\u2019s and the traditions remain very vibrant today. Enjoy the smells of food and the sounds of music.

The subway is efficient, but it\u2019s fun to stay above ground to see more on such a short visit.\nWalking Around NYC\nWalking is the best way to get around NYC. It\u2019s fun, safe, and helps you experience the city more fully.\nNYC By Subway\nSubways are the most common and convenient way to get around NYC. A lot of the trains have been updated, which makes it a bit cleaner.But don\u2019t be surprised if you see some unsightly things down there. It can be pretty funky at times.\nHere are tips if you plan to ride the subway:\nPRO TIP #1:\nDownload the official MY MTA App (Metropolitan Transit Authority) on your phone.\u00a0 You\u2019ll find maps and schedules for all the subways, bus, and rail systems.\nPRO TIP #2:\nWith your Maps/GPS App on your phone, use the \u201ctransit\u201d view to find exactly where the closest subway station is and which train to take to your destination.\nPRO TIP #3:\nMake sure you have your credit card loaded on your phone in your \u201cwallet.\u201d When you open that card, simply TAP the OMNY screen at the turnstile of the subway stop and it charges you. Just like that!\nPRO TIP #4:\nYou can purchase a\nMetrocard\ncard on your phone or at a subway station to use on buses also. Each ride costs $2.90, and a 7 day, unlimited ride card is $33. You can also swipe through the turnstile and pass the card to your travel partner behind you. Do that for up to 4 people.\nPRO TIP #5:\nIf you download an\nOMNY\ncard and use the same card or device for 12 rides in a week, the rest of the week is free.\nNYC By Uber, Lyft, Revel, or Taxi\nRide share apps are great for getting around NYC, especially at night. Obviously, they\u2019re more expensive if you are alone, but when with a group of people, it\u2019s often more cost effective than paying for separate subway fares.\nPRO TIP #6:\nLoad all the apps onto your phone in advance. Check prices for Uber, Lyft, and Revel to compare. Prices will vary a lot at different times of the day. Taxis are also available everywhere, but you have to hail one from the curb. If the cab light is on that means it\u2019s available. There\u2019s a\nCurb\nApp available for download, but I\u2019ve been told the cabs don\u2019t come as quickly as the other ride shares do.\nNYC By Ferry\nAnother fun transportation choice for parts of the city is the ferry system. It only takes you to certain spots, which might not be part of your 2 day itinerary. But check it out if you want to add some boat rides to the trip.\nThe NYC Ferries travel from Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island along the East River and Hudson River. You\u2019ll take the ferry when visiting The Statue of Liberty or taking a\nsunset cruise\n. City views are awesome from the river!\nPRO TIP #7:\nDownload the\nNYC Ferry App by Hornblower\nonto your phone. You can buy ferry tix on your phone and get a QR code to be scanned as you board the boat.\nBest Time To Go To New York City\nI love New York all times of the year, but here are things to consider in your plans for a 2 day NYC itinerary:\nMid June through Early July and Mid August through September are\nthe most popular times to visit NYC\n.\nThe warm, but not too hot weather is lovely. The middle of the summer can be pretty hot!\nFall is ideal\nwith temps in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019 fahrenheit. The crowds are smaller, the sun is warm, the trees are turning, and the air is clear.\nNovember and December\nare the most festive season to visit New York\n.\nEnjoy all the winter pop-up activities, decorations, and of course, the New Year\u2019s Eve extravaganza!\nCheck out\nThe Things To Do In New York City At Christmas here!\nFebruary and March\nare also fun because it\u2019s snowy, not very busy, and the prices are better!

As a first-time visitor to this amazing place, I can understand how intimidating planning for your NYC trip can be with so many activities and places to check out.\nSo, I\u2019ve put together an efficient NYC itinerary that is easy to follow for you, whether you\u2019re spending just a weekend in NYC, or a whole week or even more.\nTips for visiting NYC for the first time\nHow to get to Manhattan from the Airport\nTaking public transportation in NYC\nHow much time should I spend in NYC?\nWhen is the best time to visit NYC?\nWhere to stay in NYC\nThe NYC Itinerary\nDay 1: The New York Essentials\nDay 2: Midtown\nDay 3: Museums and Central Park\nDay 4: Brooklyn, DUMBO, and Lower East Side\nOther things you can do in NYC\nWhere to eat in NYC\nIs getting the New York Pass worth it?\nTips for visiting NYC for the first time\n1.\nConsider getting a travel pass to save money\n\u2013 There are many attractions to visit and do in NYC, which means you\u2019ll need to buy tickets. Getting a travel pass could ease the pain. Here are two travel passes you can consider:\nNew York Pass by Go City\n\u2013 This is an all-inclusive pass that allows you to visit as many attractions as possible within the duration of your pass. I\u2019d recommend this if you\u2019re an active traveler who wants to do everything.\nGo City New York Explorer Pass\n\u2013 On the other hand, if you want to take a slower approach and visit only select attractions, this is the pass for you. Explorer pass allows you to get discounts on selected attractions.\nI will go over in detail whether it\u2019s worth it to get these passes in the\n\u201c\nIs getting a travel pass worth it in New York?\n\u201c\nsection below. Or, you can\nsee attractions included\nin the passes to determine whether it\u2019s something you want to do.\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nBook in advance for New York Pass holders:\nIf you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an\nadvanced booking\nis still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out.\n2.\nGet the 7-day unlimited Metro pass or pay with OMNY\n\u2013 The easiest and most cost-effective way to get around NYC is by using public transport, or more specifically the subway. Read more on this in the\npublic transportation\nsection below!\n3.\nDownload the CityMapper App\n\u2013 the subway will sometimes have route diversion, outage, or just simply not running on certain days. It helps to have CityMapper handy as the app will warn you of these disruptions.\n4.\nDownload the NYC Google Maps to your phone\n\u2013 by this, I don\u2019t just mean download the Google Maps app. You can download the whole NYC map to your phone so you can peruse the map when you don\u2019t have data connections (you\u2019ll lose connections in certain spots while taking the subway). You\u2019ll also use less mobile data when browsing the maps!\nHere is how to download Maps to your phone\n.\n5.\nWear comfortable shoes meant for walking\n\u2013 I averaged 22,000 steps a day for the entire week I was in NYC. If it sounds like a lot, that\u2019s because it IS! So when I say comfortable shoes, I don\u2019t mean any flat shoes, I mean REAL comfortable shoes made for walking. I stupidly wore my Superga sneakers thinking I\u2019d be okay\u2026 but by day 3, my feet were so swollen and in pain that I had to buy emergency walking shoes \u2013 a pair of Puma trainers with proper cushions for my sore feet.\n6.\nLearn about the local quirks\n\u2013 Jaywalking, neighborhood nicknames, why the city steams, how to pronounce \u201cHouston\u201d (it\u2019s not like the city in Texas!)\u2026 I wrote\nan entire blog post with stories from my trip to NYC\n. Check it out!\nWondering what those smoke stacks are? Find out in my\nNYC stories\nblog\n7.\nLearn how to tip the American way\n\u2013 yes, I know, the tipping culture in the US baffles every visitor. It\u2019s confusing! But, you don\u2019t want to shortchange someone just because you disagree with this social norm. The most common instance where you\u2019ll need to tip is when eating at a restaurant. The general rule of thumb is to tip 20% for average service, 25% for great service, and 30% for exceptional service. You don\u2019t need to tip at establishments where the food is not served to you. Fast food, bakeries, bodegas, or dessert places are examples of these establishments, but it certainly would be nice if you felt the staff did an exceptional job. You also don\u2019t need to tip ride-sharing drivers (but again, it is always nice to), but you must tip taxi drivers.\n8.\nPrices do not include sales tax\n\u2013 If you go to a store to buy something, be mindful that the price you see does not include tax. It will be added when you pay at the cashier. This applies to tours and tickets too! But you might be happy to know that clothing and shoes below US$100 are not subject to sales tax, so the price you see is what you\u2019ll pay for those items.\n9.\nLearn the Manhattan grid system and areas\n\u2013 Manhattan contains 214 numbered east-west streets ranging from 1st to 228th, ascending from south to north. Generally speaking, Manhattan is divided into three parts:\nUptown\nis anything north of 59th Street\nMidtown\nis from 14th to 59th Street\nDowntown\nis anything south of 14th Street.\nThen, the areas are further divided into neighborhoods with funky abbreviations, as I\u2019ve talked about in my\nstories from my trip to NYC\n. I recommend watching this\nManhattan Grid youtube video by Bright Trip\nto understand Manhattan better.\n10.\n\u201cDowntown\u201d and \u201cUptown\u201d\ncan also refer to the direction of travel. For example, you\u2019ll say the train is going\nuptown\nif it\u2019s going north, and\ndowntown\nif it\u2019s going south.\n11.\nWise Card\nworked super well in NYC\n\u2013 as well as the rest of the US, really. If you\u2019re an international visitor like myself, definitely get yourself\na Wise Debit Card\n. You\u2019ll save the foreign transaction fee with it. I never had to use cash when I was in NYC and\nSan Francisco\n!\nHow to get to Manhattan from the Airport using Public Transportation\nGetting to Manhattan from the airport greatly depends on where you\u2019re staying in Manhattan and which airport you\u2019re coming from.\nView of Manhattan from my flight landing in EWR\n1. From Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR)\nYou could take public transport all the way to Manhattan, but I find it is easier to take Uber or Lyft from EWR to\nNewark Penn Station\n. From Newark Penn Station, you can either:\nIf you\u2019re staying in\nLower Manhattan\n, take the PATH train to World Trade Center, or\nIf you\u2019re staying in\nMidtown\n, take the NEC/NJCL train to Penn Station on 34th Street\nTake whichever option is closest to your accommodation. Then you can resume via Metro to your accommodation. The last time I did this, it cost me US$21 for the Uber ride and US$2.75 to take the PATH train. Relatively affordable compared to other costs in NYC!\nNYC Path Train reminds me of MRT back in Singapore\n2. From John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)\nIf you\u2019re flying to JFK, you can consider the following options:\nIf you\u2019re staying in\nMidtown\n, you\u2019ll want to take the AirTrain Red (US$ 8.25) to Jamaica Station and switch to Long Island Rail Road to Penn Station or Grand Central.\nIf you\u2019re staying in\nLower Manhattan\n, you can take Airtrain Green and switch to A train at Howard Beach Station.\nAgain, take whichever option is closest to your accommodation. Then you can resume your journey via Metro.\n3. From LaGuardia Airport (LGA)\nLaGuardia used to have a terrible reputation as one of the worst airports in America. Well, ever since the $8 billion renovation that was completed in 2022, they have shot up to be one of the best airports in the country! Here is how to get to Manhattan from LGA:\nIf you\u2019re staying in\nUptown Manhattan\n, take bus M60\nIf you\u2019re staying in\nMidtown\n, take the free Q70 bus to Queens, then resume your journey using the subway or Long Island Rail Road.\nHow to take Public Transportation in NYC\nNYC is a city with great connectivity \u2013 their public transportation will take you to plenty of places easily. The subway is the best way to get around NYC, but you could take the bus, Taxi, or private hire via Uber or Lyft. Of course, if your main concern is saving money, you\u2019ll want to take the public transportation.\n\ud83d\ude8c\nTip:\nThe Big Bus hop-on hop-off 1-day ticket (worth $60) is included in the\nNew York Pass\nA small convenience shop in the subway station\nHere are your options to pay for public transportation in NYC as a short-term tourist:\nSingle-fare ticket / Pay-per-ride ($2.90)\n\u2013 A subway ride in NYC costs $2.90 for each ride regardless of distance, which I think is quite pricey. That\u2019s why when my 7-day pass ran out, I walked everywhere unless I was going somewhere far that was worthwhile for a subway ride. You can simply tap any contactless credit card at the turnstile, or purchase a ticket at a ticket vending machine in any subway station.\n7-day Unlimited ride using MetroCard ($34)\n\u2013 You can buy the MetroCard from the vending machine at any subway station, which you can then reload. A 7-day unlimited Metro pass costs $34.\nContactless payment with\nOMNY\n(capped at $34 from Mon-Sun)\n\u2013 OMNY stands for One Metro New York, the MTA\u2019s answer for contactless payment. With this method, you get to use your existing contactless debit or credit card. No additional actions are required on your part, just tap your card on the OMNY reader at the turnstile! You can also use your smart devices if you\u2019ve added your card to it. When you use this method, you will not pay more than $34 in total fares from Monday and Sunday regardless how many rides you take.\nUnlimited MetroCard vs OMNY: Which one should I use for taking the subway in NYC?\nIf you think you\u2019ll be taking\nless than 12 subway rides\nduring your time in NYC, then it doesn\u2019t matter which one. You can buy a single-ride ticket or you can use OMNY.\nBut, if you think you\u2019ll be taking\nmore than 12 subway rides\nduring your stay in NYC, you might be wondering\u2026 which payment method should you use? The answer is: It depends on exactly how long you\u2019ll be in NYC, the smart device you have, how much you plan to take public transportation, and your personal preference!\nSo here\u2019s the deal \u2013 OMNY and the 7-day unlimited metro costs the same, but look closer and you\u2019ll notice that OMNY is capped only from Monday to Sunday, while the unlimited metro card is good for the next 7 days after activation.\nThe seven-day period for OMNY weekly cap begins at midnight on Monday and ends at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday. Unlimited MetroCards expire at midnight on the 7th (or 30th) day from the day you activated it, regardless of the time you activated the card on the first day. For example, whether you bought and activated the unlimited card by taking a subway ride at 3 pm or 11 pm on Monday, then your card will expire on Sunday at midnight.\nHere are some tips to help you decide in terms of cost:\nContactless payment with the OMNY method requires you to already have a card that supports contactless payment and/or a smart device that is compatible with contactless pay, such as an iPhone, Apple Watch, or Android phone. If you do not have these, then you\u2019ll be better off buying the unlimited MetroCard.\nIf you\u2019re arriving in the latter half of the week (say Thursday or Friday), and you\u2019re planning to do more than 12 rides during your stay, then go with the 7-day Unlimited MetroCard. You just need to take the subway more than 12 times to make it worth it \u2013 that\u2019s less than twice a day, and trust me, you\u2019ll ride the subway more than that.\nIf you\u2019re arriving earlier in the week (Monday to Wednesday) and plan to do more than 12 rides during your time in NYC, then go ahead and use OMNY!\nHowever, I personally prefer using OMNY because the benefits outweighs the potential extra costs. The OMNY method is more restrictive in terms of the weekly cap, but it\u2019s way more convenient for me to use, as I do not need to fuss with yet another card \u2013 I can just use my phone to tap into the subway.\nBy the way, the unlimited MetroCard is refillable. If you decided to go with the MetroCard, don\u2019t throw away your card after you\u2019re done using it because you can always reload the card! Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to pay $1 for a new card. It also makes for a nice memorabilia for yourself \u2013 I still kept the MetroCard I used when I visited NYC for the first time over a decade ago :\u2019)\nHow much time should I spend in NYC?\nIf it\u2019s your first time in NYC and you want to see everything, I recommend spending\nat least 4 days\nhere.\nBut I have to warn you, it\u2019s not actually possible to see everything. There are so many things to see and do in NYC \u2013 I have stayed here for a week and still didn\u2019t run out of things to do. Or heck, I even have friends who have stayed in NYC for years and still finding out something new about the city!\nWhen is the best time to visit NYC?\nSpring and Fall are great times to be in NYC. Summer could get hot and humid and Winter can get very cold. I think\nApril and May\nor\nSeptember to November\nare great months to visit NYC. I visited NYC in May and September and can vouch that the weather was great in those months.\nHowever, if you\u2019re a fan of Christmas then you\u2019ll want to visit the city in\nDecember\n. The city would be decorated with beautiful Christmas lights and Christmas trees \u2013 it\u2019s truly a magical time to be in NYC. My very first-ever visit to NYC was in December and I still fondly remember that trip, even though it was over 15 years ago.\nTip \ud83d\udca1:\nThe holiday market tour (worth $45) and Christmas Lights walking tour ($25) are included in the\nNew York Pass\nif you are visiting during the holiday season!\nWhere to stay in NYC\nIf it\u2019s your first time in NYC, you\u2019ll want to stay in Manhattan \u2013 it will make your life much easier. However, accommodations in Manhattan do tend to be more expensive.\nI stayed in Manhattan both times I visited NYC. Here are some hotel recommendations I\u2019ve stayed at:\nNew York Hilton Midtown\n\u2013 I stayed here on my first-ever visit to NYC. While it\u2019s not the most beautiful hotel, it is part of history: it is where journalist examined the Pentagon Papers, where Donald Trump delivered his 2016 winning speech and most recently, the location where the CEO of UnitedHealthcare was fatally shot in December 2024, sending the country into a frenzy. But aside from that, it\u2019s also located within walking distance of Times Square, MoMA, Central Park, and best of all, right across from the OG Halal Guys cart! \ud83d\ude0b\nNoMo in SoHo\n\u2013 Located in SoHo, this hotel is within walking distance of many good restaurants and bars in NYC. It\u2019s also conveniently within walking distance of many subway stations.\nIf you want to save some money, you could stay off Manhattan and stay in Brooklyn, but you\u2019ll probably spend more time and money commuting. You\u2019ll also want to stay near a train station if you don\u2019t stay in Manhattan. It\u2019s up to you which pro and con suits you better!\nThe NYC Itinerary Overview\nOK, so we\u2019ve talked about all the important things about visiting NYC. Time to talk about what to do in NYC!\nBelow I\u2019ve arranged daily itineraries you can do in NYC. Please note:\nyou don\u2019t HAVE to do the itinerary in the same order as I\u2019ve outlined below\n, however, I\u2019ve grouped the activities and attractions that are close to each other so that they can be visited together. That\u2019s why I call this my efficient NYC itinerary!\nMy NYC itinerary can be divided as follows:\nDay 1: The New York Essentials\nDay 2: Midtown\nDay 3: Museums and Central Park\nDay 4: Brooklyn, DUMBO, and Lower East Side\nOther things you can do in NYC\nTo visualize this NYC itinerary better, I\u2019ve created a Google Maps link that marks all the routes and landmarks I\u2019ll mention in this blog.\nMap of NYC Itinerary\n\ud83d\uddfa\nSave this map to your phone!\nIf you are a Google user, click on the image of the map above. The map will then be saved to your \u201cRecent\u201d maps viewed.\nClick here for instructions on how to view the map later\n. It will work from your phone too.\nDay 1: The New York Essentials in Lower Manhattan\nAs a first-timer in NYC, you\u2019ll want to start your visit by seeing all the must-see attractions. Let\u2019s do that today! Most of the attractions of today will be located in\nLower Manhattan\nand within walking distance of each other.\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nPS:\nThe 9/11 Memorial Museum is closed on Tuesday. It\u2019s a place you must visit if you haven\u2019t, so I recommend doing this itinerary on other days that are\nnot Tuesday\n.\n1. Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island\nWhat\u2019s a first-time visit to NYC without visiting the Statue of Liberty? Of course, this is a must! Not only do you get to see the Lady Liberty up close, but you\u2019ll also get to take a little trip on a ferry to\nEllis Island\n. Ellis Island was the entry point for many immigrants in the mid-1800s to early 1900s who shaped NYC into the city it is today.\nMake your way to\nBattery Park\nto board the ferry, which departs every 25 minutes from 9:25 am to 4:30 pm.\nStatue of Liberty\n\ud83d\uddfd\nTip:\nRound trip ferry ticket to Ellis Island, entry to the Statue of Liberty, and admission to the Immigration Museum (worth $25) are included in the\nNew York Pass\n.\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nBook in advance for New York Pass holders:\nIf you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an\nadvanced booking\nis still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out.\n2. Charging Bull and Fearless Girl at Wall Street\nOnce you\u2019re done with Ellis Island and back at Battery Park, make your way down to the edge of the Financial District to see the\nCharging Bull\n, a famous bronze statue that is an iconic symbol of Wall Street, depicting the \u201cbull\u201d period of the stock market which means optimism and prosperity.\nThis bull was first illegally dropped outside of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Wall Street by its artist, Arturo Di Monica, as part of guerilla art in 1989. The bull was then moved to its current location later that year. There is a tradition to rub the bull\u2019s\u2026 erm, scrotum when you visit, so you\u2019ll notice that part of the bull is lighter in color compared to the rest of its body. The statue has also been subject to vandalism, being painted blue during the financial crisis of 2008.\nAfter the bull, you can make your way to the\nFearless Girl\n, a statue by Kirsten Visbal to promote female empowerment, which was installed in 2017 and was originally placed facing the Charging Bull. The placement of the statue caused some controversy and complaints from Di Monica as he feels that it changed the meaning and intention behind the Charging Bull. Since then, The Fearless Girl has been temporarily moved to face the NYSE building in 2018. As of 2025, the statue is still there, but it\u2019s unclear how long it will remain.\nThe NYSE building\nRight across from the girl is none other than the\nNew York Stock Exchange (NYSE)\n. If you invest your money in US stock exchange\u2026 well, this is where it all happens. Or used to, it\u2019s not as busy as frantic as it was back in its hey day as traders have transitioned into electronic trades, but there are still traders on the trading floor of NYSE.\nHowever, there is not much you can do here aside from observing from the outside. The building is not open to the public. However, if you arrive at the opening and closing of the trading hours (9:30 AM and 4 PM), you might just hear the iconic 10-second bell from the outside of the building.\n\ud83d\uddfd\nTip:\nHow Money Was Made: Wall Street Walking Tour\nis included in the\nNew York Pass\n, worth $49.\n2. Ground Zero, 9/11 Memorial and Museum\nTip \ud83d\udca1:\nThe 9/11 museum is closed on Tuesdays!\nFrom the Wall Street, you can walk over to\nGround Zero\n\u2013 the very site of the infamous 9/11 terrorist attack. Here, you can see two pools where the two World Trade Center towers used to stand, as well as a memorial that lists the names of all the victims of the attack.\nThe\n9/11 Museum\nis a MUST visit. The 9/11 incident has shaped NYC (and definitely the world) today. I personally think the museum did a spectacular job collecting photos, personal stories, and even soundbites from that fateful day. I didn\u2019t expect to cry in a museum, but there I was, sobbing in the middle of the memorial. Thankfully, I wasn\u2019t the only one crying.\nIt was difficult to go through but necessary and very highly recommended.\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nTip:\nThe 9/11 memorial, museum, and a tour are included in the\nNew York Pass\n(worth $33)\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nBook in advance for New York Pass holders:\nIf you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an\nadvanced booking\nis still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out.\n3. The Oculus at One World Trade Center\nOnce you\u2019re done with the museum, make your way to see\nThe Oculus\n. Opened in 2016, you can\u2019t miss this white structure from the outside as it is very eye-catching. It looks like large wings on the outside, and once inside it looks like gigantic rib cages and a spine.\nThe good news? The Oculus is not a ticketed attraction \u2013 it\u2019s a shopping center and a transport hub, and it\u2019s free to enter. You can go inside to take that iconic shot from the middle of the shopping center \u2013 it is truly something else.\nThe Oculus from outside (Left) and inside (Right)\n4. See the city from above\nNYC is known for its iconic skyline, so as a first-time visitor, you must visit one of the skyscrapers to enjoy the view. I recommend doing this closer to sunset so that you get a nice soft light that\u2019s perfect for photography. Take note that you might have to reserve if you come during peak hours.\nNYC as seen from Empire State Building Observatory\nThere are many options if you want to see the city from above. Here are the options:\nEmpire State Building Observatory\n\u2013 This building needs no introduction, it\u2019s the most iconic building in NYC. You have the option to go to the 86th floor or go even higher to the 102nd floor (though I think 86th is enough). Tickets cost $44-77 depending on which floor you want to go to.\nTop of The Rock Observatory at Rockefeller Center\n\u2013 Tickets cost $40. I think this is the best option to see NYC from above!\nOne World Observatory\n\u2013 Tickets cost $53-63 depending on the package you choose. This observatory is the highest point in NYC, located on the 100-102nd floor of One World Trade Center.\nEdge in Hudson Yards\n\u2013 Tickets start from $38-42. This is one of the newer buildings in NYC.\nSummit One Vanderbilt\n\u2013 The only one on this list not covered by\nNew York Pass\n. But you can still get your ticket ahead of time\nhere\nfor cheaper. Tickets for adults start at $39-45 via the online website, but they will add tax and processing fees and vary depending on the day and time of day. So it\u2019s still a few dollars cheaper to book through\nmy link\n.\nFor this itinerary,\nOne World Observatory\nis the most convenient as you would already be in the area (It\u2019s right on top of the World Trade Center). But if you ask me for my opinion,\nTop of The Rock\nhas the best view \u2013 you can see the Empire State Building and the entirety of Central Park from here, which are the landmarks you want to see when you visit NYC.\nTip \ud83d\udca1:\nIf you\u2019re having issues choosing, you could consider getting\nNew York Pass\nbecause ALL of the options above, except Summit One, are\nincluded in the\nNew York Pass\n. You can visit even all of them if you want!\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nBook in advance for New York Pass holders:\nIf you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an\nadvanced booking\nis still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out.\nDay 2: New York Landmarks in Midtown\nOn this itinerary, you\u2019ll get to explore Midtown, which as the name might have implied\u2026 is the middle part of Manhattan, between Downtown and Uptown. Midtown is from anywhere between 14th to 59th Street. And you bet there is a lot to do here! You\u2019ll be walking plenty, so definitely put on your MOST comfortable shoes.\n1. Best of NYC Cruise\nThe Best of NYC Cruise is a 2.5-hour cruise that loops around the entire Manhattan island, starting from\nPier 83\n. They have 4 cruise times a day in the summer, at 10 am, 12 pm, 1:30 pm, and 3:30 pm. In Winter, they only run the cruise once a day at 12pm. In Spring and Autumn, the cruise runs twice a day at 10 am and 1:30 pm.\nDuring the cruise, you\u2019ll see many of New York\u2019s most famous landmarks, including a few that are out of the way and first-time visitors wouldn\u2019t normally see, like the Yankee Stadium. It\u2019s a great way to kick off a busy day!\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip:\nThe cruise is included in\nNew York Pass\n(worth $45 \u2013 52 depending on the time of the year. Summer is the most expensive, winter is the least)\n2. The Vessel\nAfter the tour, take a walk down to\nThe Vessel\n\u2013 one of the newer attractions in NYC, built as part of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project. A few years ago, you would have seen The Vessel all over Instagram, with its unique architecture that resembles a honeycomb.\nThe Vessel\nThe Vessel is open from Friday to Sunday at 11AM to 7PM (\ncheck opening times here\n)\nThe Vessel from the lobby\nWhen I visited the Vessel in 2023, only the lobby was accessible, the other levels of the Vessel were not open to the public due to suicide cases that have happened too frequently since its opening in 2019 and again after it tried to reopen in 2021.\nIn 2024, The Vessel had nets installed around it and once again open to the public. It costs $10 to enter.\n3. Edge\nIf you want to see the city from above, this is another chance! Edge is an observatory with 360 views from the 100th floor, which also includes an outdoor sky deck. It is one of the newer observatories in the city.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip:\nAdmission to Edge (worth $40) is included in the\nNew York Pass\n4. High Line Park\nThe High Line Park is a scenic 2.3km elevated trail built on a former New York Central Railroad.\nFrom Edge, the entrance to High Line Park is just a short walk away. You can enter the High Line park from the very beginning near the\nW 34 St & 12 Ave corner\n, or if you don\u2019t want to start from the very beginning, you can enter from\nthe entrance next to the Bloomberg Building\nwhich would also be very convenient from the Edge.\nView from the High Line park\nThe elevated platform means it\u2019s possible to have a nice peaceful walk through the city. For once, I was able to walk around in NYC without the anxiety\nthat some biker is going to run me over or piss someone off for not knowing how to walk like a New Yorker\n.\nWalking from one end of the High Line park to the other should take about 20 minutes.\n\ud83d\udeb6\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nTip:\nHighline & Chelsea walking tour (worth $39) which covers this area is included in the\nNew York Pass\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nBook in advance for New York Pass holders:\nIf you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an\nadvanced booking\nis still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out.\n5. Chelsea Market\nThe High Line park goes over the Chelsea Market, so as soon as you see signs for Chelsea Market you can follow it down for some good food.\nAnd it\u2019s time for lunch! There are many options at Chelsea Market, but a crowd\u2019s favorite is\nLos Tacos No. 1\n. I can definitely vouch that it\u2019s worth a visit! You can read more about it in my\nfood recommendations\nbelow.\nLos Tacos No. 1 in 2023\nLos Tacos No. 1 when I went in 2018\n6. Iconic buildings in Manhattan\nAfter you\u2019re done exploring Chelsea Market, walk over to the west side of Midtown, which should take about 20 minutes. Architecture buffs would be ecstatic about this part of the itinerary! I\u2019ll highlight three of the most popular buildings in NYC if you want to check them out, and in this exact order, for more efficient use of your time:\nFlatiron Building\n\u2013 You should already be familiar with this building. The name of this building gives away its shape \u2013 sharp triangular, like a flat iron.\nChrysler Building\n\u2013 One of NYC\u2019s Art Deco skyscrapers with a distinctly pointed spire and arched crown. I was especially fond of this building as it is the location of one of my favorite video games \u2013 Parasite Eve.\nEmpire State Building\n\u2013 This 102-story Art Deco skyscraper is a cultural icon that has appeared in many classic movies, most notably in the 1930s King Kong movie where Kong climbed the building.\n\ud83d\udca1\nTip:\nIf you\u2019d like to go up to the Empire State Building, admission to the observatory (worth $44) is included in the\nNew York Pass\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nBook in advance for New York Pass holders:\nIf you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an\nadvanced booking\nis still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out.\n7. Grand Central Terminal\nFrom the Empire State Building, The Grand Central Terminal is a mere few blocks away. Grand Central Terminal is a recognized National Historic Landmark. There are tons of things to see here, but here are my favorites:\nMain Concourse\n\u2013 Look up and you will see the 12 constellations painted in gold leaf on a Tiffany blue background. You can also check out the Apple store on the east balcony if you\u2019re an Apple fan, it is one of their most unique store locations.\nThe Whispering Gallery\n\u2013 The ceramic arches next to Grand Central Oyster Bar are an acoustic phenomenon that will let you talk to other people on the opposite ends of the corner. Try it out with a friend!\nAfter checking out the whispering gallery, you can go to\nGrand Central Oyster Bar\nfor some Clam Chowder. It is the oldest restaurant in Grand Central. At the dining concourse, there are plenty of food options too! You can get a burger from\nShake Shack\nor try\nMagnolia Bakery\n\u2018s famous banana pudding.\nTip:\nClick here\nfor more things to do at Grand Central Terminal.\nGrand Terminal Main Concourse\nDay 3: Museums and Central Park\nNow that you\u2019ve done all the New York City essentials and must-sees, I thought it would be fun to highlight yet another different side of the city. We\u2019ll be visiting a few notable museums today. You\u2019ll still be walking a lot, but at a more chilled-out pace than the other days. Most of these museums are located in the upper east side, in the vicinity of Central Park, on a stretch of fifth avenue called \u201c\nMuseum Mile\n\u201c.\nI\u2019ll be recommending some museums to visit today, but of course, you can feel free to only go to the ones that interest you! While visiting all of them is possible, it would be quite a rushed visit to do in one day. Also,\ntake notes on the days the museums are closed\n. Museums in NYC are usually closed for one day in the middle of the week.\n1. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (The Guggenheim)\nClosure Day:\nThe Guggenheim is\nclosed on Tuesdays\nIf you appreciate modern, contemporary art and architecture, you\u2019ll want to start your day at The Guggenheim. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, it has one of the most unique museum designs, spiraling upward in a cylindrical building, with artwork lining up the walls as you continue to walk up.\nGuggenheim Museum\nGuggenheim Museum\nThe Guggenheim isn\u2019t a big museum and there aren\u2019t many permanent collections, so be sure to check what\u2019s on view to see if it interests you. I think the museum is worth checking out at least once for its unique architecture.\n\ud83c\udfdb\nTip:\nAdmission to Guggenheim Museum (worth $30) is included in the\nNew York Pass\n2. The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met)\nClosure Day:\nThe Met is\nclosed on Wednesdays\nJust down the street from The Guggenheim is a name you should already be familiar with. The Met is known around the world not just for its annual star-studded\nMet Gala\n, but also for housing over two million artworks.\nI loved everything about this museum, especially the area that houses the\nTemple of Dendur\n. This area is formerly called the Sackler wing, but the name was removed after the Sackler family\u2019s role in making OxyContin addiction widespread in the US came to light.\nTemple of Dendur at The Met\nBut the fact remains that it is such a beautiful, photogenic, and serene space. Definitely my favorite part of The Met.\nAnd if you\u2019re blessed with a good sunny day, don\u2019t miss\nThe Cantor Roof Garden Bar\non the rooftop of the museum.\n3. American Museum of Natural History\nIf you are interested in this museum and you\u2019re coming from the Met, I recommend walking through Central Park and visiting Belvedere Castle on the way (see my map itinerary!)\nThose of you who are interested in dinosaur fossils (YES, real ones!), animals, and gems could spend all day here. Take note that the museum is\nopen every day from 10 am\nto 5:30 pm\n.\n\ud83c\udfdb\nTip:\nAdmission to the American Museum of Natural History (worth $30) is included in the\nNew York Pass\n4. New-York Historical Society\nClosure Day:\nThe New-York Historical Society is\nclosed on Mondays\nSo I have a confession to make\u2026 I haven\u2019t actually\nbeen\nto the Museum of Natural History, and New-York Historical Society was partially to blame.\nYou see, on my last visit to NYC, I was well on my way to visit the Museum of Natural History. New-York Historical Society is located right next to the Museum of Natural History. In my jetlagged state (I had just gotten off\na 16-hour flight from Singapore\n), I walked straight into the New-York Historical Society and paid for the ticket right away, thinking it was the Museum of Natural History. I have no idea why I did that, even though the two museums look nothing alike and I even I knew there is supposed to be a very prominent dinosaur bone in the lobby.\nLong story short, I realized my mistake way too late and decided to go along with it anyway.\nA Picasso Tapestry at NY Historical Society Museum\nBut you know what? I\u2019m so glad I made that mistake! New-York Historical Society exceeded my expectations in so many ways. There were many interesting arts and paintings related to New York City, but the standouts for me were the replica of the oval room of the White House, the unexpected Picasso tapestry, and the large collection of breathtakingly beautiful and very priceless Tiffany lamps, made by Tiffany Studios (yes, THAT Tiffany).\nGorgeous Tiffany Lamps at NY Historical Society Museum\nGorgeous Tiffany Lamps at NY Historical Society Museum\nGorgeous Tiffany Lamps!\nIf you can, please\nmake time for the FREE daily tour of the museum at 1 pm and 2:30 pm\n(\ndouble check the tour time here\n). I got there just in time to join the tour and it greatly enhanced my experience visiting the museum.\n\ud83c\udfdb\nTip:\nAdmission to the New-York Historical Society (worth $24) is included in the\nNew York Pass\n5. Central Park\nThe museums are already on the fringe of Central Park, so I don\u2019t need to tell you how to get there. Central Park is a massive park in the middle of Manhattan. And allegedly, it is the most filmed location in the world!\nView from Central Park\nThere are tons of things to do here and the park is massive, but here are a few things I think are worth checking out at the park:\nSakura / Cherry Blossom Trees\n\u2013 If you\u2019re visiting NYC in April or May, you will be interested in viewing the beautiful Cherry Blossom trees, because they will be in full bloom.\nHere is where to find the cherry blossom trees in Central Park\n.\nBethesda Terrace\n\u2013 One of the many architectural features in Central Park. I\u2019m a huge fan of the ceramic tiles that form a beautiful pattern on the ceiling of the terrace.\nBethesda Terrace in Central Park\nJohn Lennon tribute\n\u2013 In the eastern part of Central Park is a small tribute to John Lennon. You can start at The Dakota on 72nd Street, where Lennon lived with Yoko Ono. It was at the entrance to the apartment that he was murdered in 1980. In front of The Dakota on the Central Park side, you\u2019ll find the Imagine Mozaic on the floor, a tribute to Lennon\u2019s most popular song, and Strawberry Fields, a tribute to The Beatles\u2019 song he wrote.\nSheep Meadow\n\u2013 From Spring to Autumn, this meadow is filled with lush green grass, an excellent for a picnic with friends or a solo afternoon nap.\nAn afternoon nap by myself at the Central Park\n\ud83d\udeb2\nTip:\nIf you have the\nNew York Pass\n, a Central Park bike tour (worth $52), a Central Park walking tour (worth $27), TV & movies tour (worth $36), and a bike rental (worth $46) is included.\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nBook in advance for New York Pass holders:\nIf you are going during the peak holiday season (such as the June-July summer holidays), an\nadvanced booking\nis still required on top of buying the pass, because some attractions are popular and might sell out.\n6. Museum of Modern Arts (MoMA)\nOpening Hours:\nYou\u2019ll be happy to know that unlike other museums, MoMA is\nopen every day\nfrom 10:30\u00a0pm to 5:30\u00a0pm except on Thanksgiving and Christmas.\nFrom Central Park, head towards the South end of the park and you\u2019ll find MoMA just a few blocks down.\nMoMA is the mother of all modern and contemporary art museums, and it\u2019s a must-visit for all modern art fans. MoMA houses some of the most recognized artworks of our lifetime, including The Starry Night by Van Gogh, The Dance by Henri Matisse, Water Lillies by Monet, The Persistence of Memory by Dali, Campbell Soup by Andy Warhol as well as works by Picasso, Roy Lichtenstein, and Jackson Pollock.\n\ud83c\udfdb\nTip:\nAdmission to MoMA (worth $30) is included in the\nNew York Pass\nTrying to see Starry Night at MoMA\nView of downtown NYC from MoMA\n7. Times Square and Broadway\nFinally, when you\u2019re done with MoMA, it\u2019s time to walk over to\nTimes Square\nat Broadway and 42nd Street. Times Square is arguably the most touristy yet must-visit site in Manhattan for first timers. Avoid going there during New Year\u2019s Eve, it\u2019s just not worth it when it\u2019s that crowded.\nTimes Square is better to visit at night or as the sun is about to go down so that you can see all the billboards and LED signs lit up into the night. I recommend having some hot dogs straight from the street vendors at Times Square, not necessarily for their culinary value, but more for that quintessentially New York experience. Hot dogs were brought to NYC by German immigrants, in the form of push carts in the 1860s. In NYC, the sausages used are made from beef.\nHere is a cool photo I took at (almost) the same place in Times Square, a decade apart. Can you spot some differences?\nI took these photos of Times Square in 2008 (Left) vs 2018 (Right)\nTimes Square is within the Theater District. If you have time, you must check out some\nBroadway shows\nwhile you\u2019re in the city.\nHamilton\n,\nLion King\n,\nPhantom of the Opera\n,\nWicked\n, and\nBook of Mormon\nare some of the most popular shows.\n\ud83c\udfdb\nTip:\nA Broadway and Times Square walking tour (worth $39) is included in the\nNew York Pass\nTimes Square\nDay 4: Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Lower East Side\nCongrats! you\u2019re pretty much almost done with all the must-sees in Manhattan. But you\u2019re not done with New York, nope! So it\u2019s time to leave Manhattan and cross over to the other side for a more chilled-out day of arts, food, and walks by the river.\n\ud83d\udca1\nNote:\nThis itinerary is best to do on a\nSaturday\nManhattan as seen from Brooklyn\n1. Explore Williamsburg\nWilliamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, filled with things to do and shops to check out. Some may say it\u2019s gentrified, but it\u2019s still fun to visit. You can start your way from Metropolitan Av station. Here are some recommendations on what to see and visit here.\nQuimby\u2019s Bookstore\n\u2013 Indie bookstore providing curated titles\nThe City Reliquary\n\u2013 A small non-profit museum where you can see memorabilia of the city. They have both permanent and rotating exhibitions.\nSee what\u2019s on at City Reliquary here\n.\nJoe\u2019s Pizza Mohammad Ali Mural\n\u2013 PS: Joe\u2019s Pizza is also not a bad place to grab a bite unless you\u2019re here on a Saturday in which case you\u2019ll want to check out Smorgasburg.\nArtists & Fleas\n\u2013 A marketplace for craft makers, where you can shop goods from local small businesses. Only open on weekends.\nSmorgasburg\n\u2013 If you\u2019re here on a Saturday, you might want to check out\nSmorgasburg\n, a large open-air food market that started at Williamsburg but has now opened up in many other locations in NYC.\nDomino Park\n\u2013 A nice park to chill by the east river\nMona Lisa of Williamsburg\n\u2013 One of the most famous murals in Williamsburg.\nMore street art\n\u2013 If you are interested in street art and murals, you can see more on my\nNYC map\n.\n2. DUMBO\nFrom Williamsburg, you can continue to walk down south for 1 hour. If that sounds crazy, you could take the East River (ER) ferry from South Williamsburg to DUMBO for $2.75 and 12 minutes of your time \u2013\nclick here for the ferry route info\n. I say, take the ferry.\nWhat\u2019s DUMBO? Well, it\u2019s a cheeky abbreviation to describe the location: \u201c\nD\nown\nU\nnder the\nM\nanhattan\nB\nridge\nO\nverpass\u201d. By the way, NYC is full of these amazing acronyms! You can read my\nNYC stories post\nfor more NYC anecdotes like this.\nIn DUMBO, you must stop by to take one of these shots:\nThat famous part of DUMBO\nIt\u2019s the spot where you can see the Manhattan Bridge, along with the Empire state building perfectly framed in one of its lower arches. There will be tons of people here, but if you come early enough in the morning then I reckon you\u2019ll get a pretty nice photo without anyone in it.\nAside from the viewpoint, there are also plenty of places to eat at DUMBO. My recommendation is\nJuliana\u2019s\nwhich is a very popular pizzeria (they don\u2019t sell their pizzas by the slice though, so you\u2019ll have to get a whole pie) or\nShake Shack\nif you have yet to give it a try by now.\n3. Walk on the Brooklyn Bridge back to Manhattan\nOnce you\u2019re done exploring DUMBO, make your way to Brooklyn Bridge. If you have time, you can stroll along the river at Brooklyn Bridge Park first before going to the bridge itself. You\u2019ll get this nice view of the Brooklyn Bridge set against Manhattan.\nBrooklyn Bridge from Brooklyn Bridge Park\nBrooklyn Bridge is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the US, connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn. Most visitors walk or bike through the Brooklyn Bridge. You can walk across the bridge, which will take you approximately an hour, or you can rent a bike. Either way, there will be a lot of people on the walking platform!\nPretzels at Brooklyn Bridge\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nTip:\nIf you have the\nNew York Pass\n, a Brooklyn Bridge, and DUMBO tour (worth $35), Brooklyn Bridge Bike Rental (worth $40), and Brooklyn Bridge Walking Tour (worth $27) are already included.\n4. Explore the rest of Manhattan\nOnce you\u2019ve crossed the bridge, you\u2019ll find yourself in Lower Manhattan. From here, you can explore the rest of Manhattan according to your interest \u2013 I would suggest taking a look at Lower East Side and East Village. I\u2019ve marked a bunch of restaurants, bars, and points of interest on\nmy NYC map\n. Or, read on to find\nmore things to do in NYC\nbelow!\nOther things you can do in NYC\nSo you\u2019ve combed my itinerary and have done everything you want to do in that itinerary. Well, fret not \u2013 NYC truly is a city that never sleeps.\nHere are a few more recommendations what you can do:\nThings to do in East Village and Lower East Side\nEast Village and Lower East Side are two of Manhattan\u2019s most happening neighborhoods. Take your time to enjoy Manhattan\u2019s best food, art, and music scene, such as:\nKatz Deli\n\u2013 A famous deli serving Jewish American cuisine. You can read more about it in my\nfood recommendations\nbelow.\nThe Bowery Ballroom\n\u2013 Fans of indie music can catch a show at this intimate venue.\nSee what\u2019s on at Bowery Ballroom\nThe Back Room\n\u2013 One of the original speakeasies from the prohibition era still in operation today. They serve drinks in unassuming white tea cups, just like how people used to enjoy their poison of choice back in the prohibition days!\nMcSorley\u2019s Old Ale House\n\u2013 A beer joint that has existed since 1854. You can only get either light or dark ale here, as well as some bar grubs (burgers, sandwiches and hotdogs).\nUkrainian Village\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 \u2013 A subsection of east village where you can find Ukrainian restraurants and businesses. Try\nStreecha\nand\nVeselka\nfor comforting Ukrainian food, or go to\nThe Ukrainian Museum\nto check out some\npysanky\n(beautiful wax-painted eggs).\nAlphabet City\n\u2013 This area is a portion of the east village where the streets are named Avenue A, B, C, and D. You can see where it got the name right? You can find plenty of restaurants and bars here in Alphabet City.\nPastrami on Rye from Katz Deli\nMore things to do and places to visit in Manhattan\nComedy Cellar\nin West Village \u2013 A comedy club in West Village. You won\u2019t know the lineup until you show up, but many famous comedians (such as Dave Chapelle) have been known to make a surprise appearance. It\u2019s considered to be the best comedy club in the country.\nMake reservations here\n.\nSleep No More\nin Chelsea \u2013 The ultimate immersive theater experience, based on Shakespeare\u2019s\nMacbeth\n, that I can\u2019t describe with words. Even if I try, you\u2019ll likely have a different experience than me, due to the flexible \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d format of Sleep No More. You just have to experience it yourself and go with the flow. As it is located near Chelsea in Midtown, I would suggest fitting this on the\nDay 2 itinerary\nabove.\nBuy tickets here\n.\nHester Street Fair\nat various locations \u2013 If you are free on a Saturday, you can check out this open-air street fair, where you can hunt for food and vintage goodies.\nCheck their website here\n.\nMy mask and a ring I got from Sleep No More\nAmateur night at The Apollo\nin Harlem \u2013 This requires traveling uptown to Harlem and only happens on the first Thursday of the month, but it was worthwhile to make the trip out there! Similar to Comedy Cellar, you just never know which future superstar is making their debut night here, which has included names like Ella Fitzgerald, Stevie Wonders, Lauryn Hill, and Michael Jackson & The Jackson Five.\nBuy tickets here\n.\nApollo Theater in Harlem\nBohemian\nin NoHo \u2013 An exclusive restaurant in NoHo, located in Andy Warhol\u2019s former studio. You can only dine here if you know the name of someone who has been here before.\nStrand Bookstore\nin Union Square \u2013 A large bookstore specializing in used and rare books.\nThe Django\nin Tribeca \u2013 A Jazz Bar in Roxy hotel. Good for drinks and live acts.\nBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s at Blue Box Cafe\n\u2013 Fans of the jewelry brand would want to check this out. You can have high tea at a cute cafe fully decorated in that popular Tiffany Blue shade.\nBe sure to reserve a table here\n.\nOther things to do in New York\nConey Island\nin Brooklyn \u2013 If you\u2019re visiting New York during summer, you can check out Coney Island in the southwestern part of Brooklyn. It features a whimsical seaside amusement park close to the beach, with games, food, and fairs.\nBrooklyn Bowl\n\u2013 A music venue combined with a bowling alley. You\u2019ll definitely have a great time here.\nWhere and What to Eat in NYC\nThere are many good places to eat in NYC, and I enjoyed eating my way through NYC during my stay. Here are a few standouts that I truly enjoyed during my stay:\nLos Tacos No.1\n\u2013 Yes, I lined up for this. Yes, it is located in the extremely touristy Chelsea Market. But YES, it was so worth it. They only serve 4 types of tacos. I tried cactus (nopal) tacos for the first time here \u2013 while this was not my cup of tacos, I do recommend trying it at least once and highly recommend the other three tacos.\nLos Tacos No. 1\nLevain Cookies\n\u2013 Worth. the. damn. hype. Just go get yourself their walnut chocolate chip cookie and you can thank me later. If there is a line, don\u2019t fret because it moves super fast\u2026 so there is no reason why you shouldn\u2019t go! I originally planned to buy the cookies and then walk over to Central Park to eat them, but let\u2019s be honest \u2013 they only lasted a few steps outside the bakery\n*mouth waters from thinking about their cookies*\n. The original branch is on the Upper West Side, but you can find Levain in many parts of NYC now.\nLevain Cookies \u2013 I think this was chocolate chip walnut\nAmerican Jewish Deli\n\u2013 Comprising approximately 13% of NYC\u2019s population, the Jewish community in NYC is the largest in the world outside of Israel. The Jews immigrated to NYC from the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, and these immigrants created what is now known as a Jewish delicatessen (or deli for short). At these delis, you can find the classic pastrami on rye and my new-found love: Matzo ball soup, among other dishes \u2013 some of which are unique to Jewish Americans.\nI became obsessed with Matzo ball soup, so I hit up as many delis as I could. Here are a few delis that I loved when I was in NYC:\nKatz Deli\n(in Lower East Side)\u00a0\u2013 This is the place that introduced me to Matzo ball soup, so they needed to be mentioned. The\nHarry Met Sally\nthing is pretty cool too, I guess \ud83d\ude01\nSarge\u2019s Deli\n(in Midtown)\u00a0\u2013 Out of all the Jewish delis I tried, their pastrami sandwich is the best! They also have the most homely ambiance, and their Matzo ball is pretty good.\n2nd Ave Deli\n(in Upper East Side) \u2013 OK, by now you guys have definitely caught on that I visited all the famous delis because of my Matzo ball soup obsession\u2026 and the one at 2nd Ave Deli was my favorite Matzo ball soup out of them all. It comes with carrots! and a choice of 3 types of carbs!\nMatzo Ball soup from 2nd Ave Deli\nBabka\n\u2013 A type of bread swirled with chocolate and cinnamon, popular with the Jewish community in eastern European countries. Many have said babka is the best sweet to get in NYC.\nBreads Bakery\nis a popular place to get Babka from in NYC.\nThe Halal Guys on 53rd and 6th\n\u2013 Because you haven\u2019t been to NYC without tasting that magical secret white sauce, made popular by none other than the New York cabbies themselves. They have carts all over the city now, but the OG one is this one on 53rd and 6th.\nThe original Halal Guys cart on 53rd and 6th av\nWhen I first visited New York City in 2008, I stayed at the Hilton at Midtown, which you can see in the background of the photo above. Each time we pass by this corner around dinner time, this one food cart would have a long line snaking out. So one night just before flying back, I decided to join the line \u2013 and then I understood why. Their gyro platter with the white and red sauce is SO delicious and relatively affordable for New York\u2019s price. I liked it so much that I hand-carried one plate on a flight back to\nLA\nfor my family to try!\nBut I\u2019m warning you:\nBe careful of the red sauce\n\u2013 they are legit spicy.\nIt was as good as I remembered\nIs getting a travel pass worth it in New York?\nThe\nNew York Pass\nallows you to visit as many attractions as possible during the duration of your pass. Sounds good? Well, it depends. I would only recommend this if you\u2019re the type of traveler who likes to move fast and want to see everything.\nIf you follow my\nitinerary\nabove, your New York Pass utilization could look like this (Prices last updated on January 2025):\nDay 1\nStatue of Liberty and Ellis Island\n$25\n9/11 Memorial & Museum\n$33\nTop of the Rock Observatory\n$40\nDay 2\nBest of NYC Cruise\n$49\nEdge\n$40\nChelsea and High Line Walking Tour\n$39\nEmpire State Building\n$44\nDay 3\nGuggenheim Museum\n$30\nMoMA\n$30\nCentral Park Bike Tour\n$49\nTotal value\n$379\n3-day New York Pass\n(-$259)\nPotential Savings\n$120\n(All currency in this calculation is quoted in USD)\nAnd if you decide to take the Big Bus Tour on one of the days (worth $82), it would add even more to the total value of the pass to be $461. A 3-day pass costs $259 at the time of writing, so you could potentially save $120 to $202 with the\nNew York Pass\n.\nOf course, this is all dependent on your ability to plan and use up the pass to its full potential. Even though the New York pass is available for up to 7 days, I would only advise getting the 3-day pass and doing as many things as possible during those days to make it truly worth it.\nHowever, if you decide that you want to chill and only visit a few select attractions, you can consider\nGo City New York Explorer Pass\ninstead. You\u2019ll likely save money through this pass, provided you pick high-value attractions that cost $37 or more. The pass is valid for 60 days after activation so you can take your time.\nMy recommendations for such attractions are:\nTop of the Rock \u2013 $40\nCentral Park Bike Tour \u2013 $52\nBest of NYC cruise \u2013 $49\nThe vessel \u2013 $39\nEdge \u2013 $42\nHigh Line Tour \u2013 $39\nOkay, that was one long post on everything I know about NYC! I hope this post has been useful to you. And as usual, if you have any questions, please feel free to comment below.\n24 Comments\nSprunki\nsays\nFebruary 15, 2025\nLove this itinerary!

Creating itineraries with limited time is one of my nightmares. This was absolutely useful, especially the level of detail you got to and all the tips shared.\nI\u2019m glad i found it! Thanks again.\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nSeptember 26, 2024\nHey Diane, thanks for taking the time to leave me a comment. I appreciate it! Have fun in NYC!\nReply\nJoel Weiner\nsays\nSeptember 4, 2024\nBy the way. Among the 3 delis\u2019 mentioned above, only the 2nd Ave Deli is KOSHER\u2026Katz\u2019s and Sarge\u2019s are NOT KOSHER .   They are often referred to as Jewish Style delis\u2019 because of the products offered.   Jewish style doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Kosher or Glatt Kosher\u2026there is a difference between even these two.\nIf you visit Borough Park, Crown Heights or South Williamsburg ALL in Brooklyn, the Orthodox Jewish communities there frequent the Glatt Kosher Delis\u2019 in their neighborhoods.\nEnough said\u2026if you need more education on the subject, just Google your questions.. Lol\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nSeptember 4, 2024\nHey Joel, thanks for the info!\nReply\nSophia Park\nsays\nAugust 9, 2024\nHi, this is Sophia from South Korea!\nI was looking for a guide to my future trip to Estern coast and I was really fortunate to find your blog \ud83d\ude42\nThank you so much the details and I truly appreciate it.\nOne thing that I want to ask for your suggestion is that do you know any kids baking classes held in New York or any other part of the area?\nI\u2019m thinking of opening up one in my country and wanted to get a grip of the process of how the class goes if I can find one.\nAlso, I\u2019ve been to San Francisco, LA and San Diego with my friend who\u2019s an American. But this time I\u2019m traveling alone and was wondering if getting a mate to share the place I stay(preferably a hotel\u2026.?) is an okay thing to do or not. Do Americans do such a thing? \ud83e\udd23 Haha \ud83d\ude02\nReply\nIsh\nsays\nJuly 28, 2024\nThank you so much for such detailed and helpful itinerary! Best wishes from Australia! \ud83d\ude42\nReply\nRachael\nsays\nJune 27, 2024\nHello Melissa,\nI planned my LA trip last year with the help of your suggested itinerary and it was wonderful! So here I am again, planning my trip to new york in July! \ud83d\ude00\nI want to see the Statue of Liberty but am worried about the queue for the ferry to ellis island from battery park. I am wondering can I get a view of the statue of liberty from other places (eg battery park?)\nAlso, I am planning my trip to brooklyn. I will walk on the brooklyn bridge in the morning, get to DUMBO, then walk along the brooklyn heights promenade and brooklyn bridge park. Aiming to get back to manhatten in late afternoon. Does that sound too ambitious?\nLastly, do you have any suggestions for places to eat after visiting the 911 museum?\nGrateful for your suggestions!\nReply\nMelissa\nsays\nJune 28, 2024\nHey Rachael, thanks for stopping by!\nYes you can see the statue of liberty from Battery Park, it will be quite small, but you can see it. Another way to see it closer without getting on the ferry is the Best of NYC Cruise, although it is quite popular as well so you\u2019d want to book ahead.\nWalking over the brooklyn bridge is a good plan if the weather cooperates \u2013 in fact, that\u2019s exactly what I did as well! Just the other way around \u2013 I took the train to Brooklyn then walked back to Manhattan. Either way works though.\nThe 911 Museum is located downtown in Financial District. There is a Joe\u2019s Pizza just a few street away if you want that quintessential NY slice of pizza experience. Stage Door deli is nearby for a classic NY deli.\nReply\nEmma Taynton\nsays\nMay 23, 2024\nHi, my husband and I are going to NYC all the way from Scotland in June.

More info:\nDisclosure.\nPlanning a trip to New York City and looking for a doable itinerary for up to 7 days in NYC? This guide has got you covered!\nWe recently spent a week in New York, and it took me about as much time to plan this trip as the time actually spent exploring\u2026 No kidding. Don\u2019t worry, though. By following this itinerary, you\u2019ll be able to plan a perfect trip in no time.\nNew York City offers an overwhelming array of attractions, each more interesting than the other. This makes it quite challenging to plan your first visit. What are the must-sees? How do you group the attractions in the most efficient way? In other words, where do you even start to prepare your New York itinerary?\nTo help you create a realistic plan for 7 days in New York, in this guide, I share\nour one-week NYC itinerary pretty much as we did it (+ avoiding our mistakes).\nIt covers all the top attractions, but also several hidden gems and local favorites that will make your trip so much more memorable.\nPRO TIP:\nBook your NYC hotel as soon as you have your travel dates. The prices vary widely based on timing and availability and can skyrocket when the demand is high.\nClick here\nfor the best deals, and if you find something you like, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait to book! One of the hotels we stayed at doubled in price just weeks before our trip, and another sold out.\nWhere we stayed:\nWe recommend staying in central Manhattan. We split our stay between\nFairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Penn Station\nand\nVirgin Hotels New York City\n(to compare options and give better recommendations to our readers ;)). Fairfield Inn offers great value, while Virgin is a more luxurious, modern experience. Both have excellent locations, so it depends on your budget and style preference.\nFor most days in this itinerary, you\u2019ll find a\ndetailed, hour-by-hour plan\nbased on our personal experience and exactly what we did in 7 days in NYC. To help you get a better idea of how everything fits together, we also created a\nmap\nindicating all the mentioned spots and restaurant recommendations \u2013 see below.\nGood to know:\nOne week is the perfect amount of time to explore the Big Apple at a comfortable pace. But if you have fewer days, you can easily adapt our itinerary for a\n3, 4, 5, or 6-day trip\nby prioritizing must-see sights and adjusting based on your interests.\nYou can swap attractions or even entire days to customize the itinerary to your preferences.\nPRO TIP:\nCheck opening hours and days for attractions in advance. To avoid disappointment (and long lines), book your tickets ahead of time! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find helpful links throughout the itinerary for easy planning and reservations.\nHow to use this map:\nUse your computer mouse (or fingers) to zoom in or out. Click on the icons to get more information about each place. Click the arrow on the top left corner for the index. Click the star next to the map\u2019s title to add it to your Google Maps account. To view the saved map on your smartphone or PC, open Google Maps, click the menu and go to \u2018Your Places\u2019/\u2019Maps\u2019. If you want to print the map or see it in a bigger window, click on \u2018View larger map\u2019 in the top right corner.\nHere is our recommended New York 7-day itinerary:\nDAY 1\nARRIVAL + CHELSEA & HUDSON YARDS\n.\nDepending on what time you arrive in New York, you will likely not have a full day to explore. We recommend starting with a visit to\nChelsea and Hudson Yards\non the first day. It\u2019s within walking distance of central Manhattan (and hotels we recommended) and you can see the highlights here in just a few hours. But there is also enough to see and do if you have more time.\nHere are some places we recommend visiting on your first day in New York:\nLittle Island, Pier 57 Rooftop Park, Chelsea Market, The High Line, Hudson Yards, Vessel, and the Edge. If you have extra time, you could also visit the Whitney Museum of American Art on this day.\nTIP:\nThe Edge is one of the best viewing platforms in Manhattan and a great place to be around sunset. It can get quite busy here, so be sure to\nbook your tickets\nin advance! If you want to start your NYC trip with a bang, consider the\nCity Climb Skyscraping Experience\nat the Edge!\nGood to know:\nChelsea Market is a great place for lunch or dinner \u2013 you will find everything here, from burgers and Asian food to some of the best tacos in NYC. Pier 57 has a small food court as well. We also indicated a few nice restaurants in this area on our map, but these will require reservations, definitely for dinner.\nREAD ALSO:\nBest Observation Decks in New York\nThe High Line.\nChelsea Market.\nLittle Island.\nTiming-wise, this is what your first day in NYC could look like (based on what we did):\nArrive in NYC, check in at the hotel, etc.\nMake your way to the Hudson River (by taxi, subway, or on foot).\n4 \u2013 5 PM: Visit Pier 57 and its rooftop terrace and Little Island.\n5 \u2013 6 PM: Visit Chelsea Market and walk the entire length of the Highline. Plan some extra time if you want to have an early dinner!\n6 \u2013 6.15 PM: Hudson Yards, Vessel (photo stop).\n6.30 \u2013 7.30 PM: Edge (\nbook tickets in advance\n!).\nDinner at Ci Siamo.\nGood to know:\nIf you have just 5-6 days in New York and are looking for a shorter itinerary, or if you cannot visit all these places on day 1, this entire section could be easily incorporated in the late afternoon/evening on day 6 of our itinerary below. Location- and timing-wise, it\u2019s a perfect fit.\nThe Edge has the most unique outdoor observation deck in Manhattan!\nGlass floor at the Edge viewing platform.\nVessel at Hudson Yards.\nDAY 2\nSTATUE OF LIBERTY, FINANCIAL DISTRICT, WORLD TRADE CENTER\n.\nNo New York itinerary could be complete without seeing the Statue of Liberty! A proper visit to Liberty Island and Ellis Island requires at least 4-5 hours, so start early and schedule enough time for it. You also have to book in advance!\nFor more information on how to visit the Statue of Liberty, please see our detailed guide below.\nLEARN MORE:\nHow to Visit the Statue Of Liberty from New York\nAfter you return to Manhattan, explore the Financial District and the landmarks of the World Trade Center.\nSome of the must-sees of the\nFinancial District\ninclude Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange, and the famous Charging Bull. Afterward, check out the Trinity Church and also St. Paul\u2019s Chapel.\nAt the\nWorld Trade Center\n, you really can\u2019t miss Ground Zero with 9/11 Memorial Pools and the impressive Oculus building. The 9/11 Memorial Museum is also absolutely worth a visit! But there is so much more to see here: FDNY Memorial Wall, The Sphere, St. Nicholas Church, etc.\nWe did and highly recommend\nthis amazing 9/11 Memorial Tour\n. It\u2019s one of the best tours we did in New York \u2013 we learned so much! Our tour also included skip-the-line tickets to the 9/11 Museum. If you plan to visit this museum on your own, be sure to\nbook timed-entry tickets\nin advance!\nEnd your day with a visit to\nOne World Observatory\n, the highest observation deck in New York. The 360\u00c2\u00b0 views are absolutely phenomenal! Also here, it\u2019s best to\nbook your tickets in advance\n.\nStatue of Liberty and Manhattan skyline.\nCharging Bull at the Financial District.\nThe Oculus at World Trade Center.\nThis is what this day could look like, based exactly on what we did:\n9 AM \u2013 1 PM: Statue of Liberty.\n1.30 \u2013 2 PM: Charging Bull and lunch at Liberty Bagels.\n2 \u2013 3 PM: Financial District, Trinity Church.\n3 \u2013 5 PM:\n9/11 Memorial Tour\n.\n5 \u2013 7 PM: 9/11 Memorial Museum (tickets were included with our tour).\n7.15 \u2013 8.15 PM: One World Observatory (we booked\n(flexible) tickets\nin advance).\nDinner at EATALY NYC Downtown.\nAlternative suggestion:\nIf you are not interested in spending half a day to visit the Statue of Liberty, you can also simply book a 1-hour sightseeing cruise. There are many options, but you must pay attention to the departure location! For this itinerary, we recommend\nthis \u2018express\u2019 cruise\nfrom Pier 16, very close to the Financial District in Lower Manhattan.\nBucket list:\nIn this same area, you could also do\na helicopter tour\n. It takes very little time (12-30 minutes depending on the options chosen), has many possible departure times, and is a great addition to any NYC itinerary. By far the best option for this itinerary is\nthis highly-rated helicopter tour\nstarting from Pier 6. Just be sure to book well in advance because it\u2019s extremely popular! We hesitated a bit too long and it was sold out for the time that suited us\u2026\nGround Zero Memorial at WTC.\n9/11 Memorial Museum.\nSunset view from One World Observation Deck.\nDAY 3\nTHE MET, CENTRAL PARK, 5TH AVENUE, TOP OF THE ROCK, TIMES SQUARE, BROADWAY SHOW\n.\nNext, it\u2019s time to explore Midtown Manhattan and the area around Central Park!\nWe recommend starting your day with a short walk on the famous Museum Mile and visiting one of the museums. Plan to spend no more than 2-3 hours at a museum \u2013 your back will thank you and you will still have plenty of time for the rest of the places we recommend seeing on this day.\nBy far the most impressive is the\nMetropolitan Museum of Art (The Met)\n. This museum is enormous, has the strangest (but amazing!) collection of a bit of everything, and it\u2019s overwhelming. We visited the MET with\nthis 2-hour \u2018express tour\u2019\nand were really glad to have a guide. We wouldn\u2019t have seen half as much on our own!\nOther options include the\nGuggenheim Museum\nor the\nAmerican Museum of Natural History\n. The latter is especially great if visiting New York with a family. Both of these museums are included with the\nNew York CityPASS\n.\nIn the afternoon, explore the famous\nCentral Park\n. This park is also immense, so we recommend concentrating on the southern part where all the famous spots are located. Some of the must-sees at Central Park include Belvedere Castle, Bethesda Terrace, Bow Bridge, and the boating lake. In winter, you can go ice skating at Wollman Rink.\nLEARN MORE:\nTop Places Not To Miss in Central Park\nAfterwards, do some window shopping on\n5th Avenue\nand check out\nSt. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral\n.\nNext, walk to Rockefeller Center and visit\nTop of The Rock\n. This observation deck is very centrally located and offers\nthe\nbest views in Manhattan. Of course, it would be nice to be here at sunset, but this will depend on the time of year. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it though \u2013 the views are spectacular at any time! But I highly recommend\nbooking your tickets in advance\n!\nHave an early dinner and end your day with a visit to the iconic\nTimes Square\nand see a\nBroadway Show\n(see all the\nbest options here and book tickets in advance\n!). We opted for\nThe Lion King\nat Minskoff Theater, right at Times Square.\nThe Met.\nCentral Park.\nBethesda Terrace in Central Park.\nThis is what this day could look like, based on what we did:\n+-10 AM: Arrive at Museum Mile, see the Guggenheim Museum from the outside, and walk to the MET.\n11 AM \u2013 1 PM:\nMet Express guided tour.\n1 \u2013 1.30 PM. Lunch. To save time, you could have lunch at the MET. We bought some sandwiches at Sant Ambroeus Madison (very pricey but really good) and held a small picnic at Central Park.\n1.30 \u2013 4.30 PM: Central Park, 5th Avenue.\n4.30 \u2013 5.30 PM: Top of the Rock (\nbook timed-entry tickets\n!).\nQuick dinner \u2013 there are tons of restaurants and eateries in this area.\n7 or 8 PM: Broadway Show (\ncheck what\u2019s available and book in advance!\n).\nTimes Square.\nIf this sounds too rushed for you, you could also visit The Met without a tour. In that case, arrive at 10 AM, when it opens. Alternatively, spend less time at Central Park and/or 5th Avenue. There are also\npedicab tours\navailable at the park, if you don\u2019t want to walk as much.\nIf you can book a show that starts at 8 PM (most shows start later on weekends), that will also give you more time for the other attractions during the day.\nView from the Top of The Rock.\nRockefeller Center.\nTimes Square.\nDAY 4\nBROOKLYN, TENEMENT MUSEUM, LITTLE ITALY & CHINATOWN\n.\nWith a week in New York, you should find some time to explore some local neighborhoods beyond the most popular tourist attractions. We opted for Brooklyn, Chinatown, and Little Italy since it\u2019s really easy to fit all of these together in a single day.\nStart your day with a walk from Manhattan over the iconic\nBrooklyn Bridge\n. The best place to access this bridge is just as you exit the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall subway station. We indicated it on our map.\nOnce in Brooklyn, continue on the bridge as far as you can, and visit\nBrooklyn Heights\n. This is such a cool area, with trendy cafes and restaurants. You could stop for a coffee and some delicious pastries at L\u2019Appartement 4F on Montague Street. Next, continue north on Brooklyn Heights Promenade and stop for pictures at Old Pier 1.\nFor lunch, we recommend\nTime Out Market\n. They have a big food court with tons of restaurants and a beautiful rooftop terrace with stunning views over the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Skyline. Don\u2019t forget to take some pictures at the Dumbo \u2013 Manhattan Bridge Viewpoint before you leave Brooklyn!\nNext, walk over (a very noisy)\nManhattan Bridge\nback to Manhattan. Here, we highly recommend visiting the\nTenement Museum\n. Set inside an old tenement house, a visit here gives a unique look into over 100 years of New York City history.\nThe museum can only be visited with a 1-hour guided tour. Each tour is a bit unique as it focuses on different families who lived here in different periods. We didn\u2019t book in advance and simply joined the next available tour. But if you want to be sure to do a specific tour at a specific time, I recommend making reservations\non their website\nin advance.\nAfterward, explore the local neighborhoods like Chinatown and Little Italy. We booked\nthis highly-rated Chinatown & Little Italy food tour\n. It\u2019s a great way to see the highlights of this unique part of Manhattan and at the same time try all kinds of foods from local eateries. If you do this tour at 5.30-7.30 PM as we did, you won\u2019t need dinner anymore!\nIn the evening, you could visit the Empire State Building (or leave it for another day, e.g. day 6 in this itinerary). In any case,\nbook tickets in advance\nor you risk wasting lots of time. We ended this day with some drinks at a rooftop bar at our hotel.\nBrooklyn Bridge.\nBrooklyn Heights Promenade.\nDUMBO Manhattan Bridge View.\nThis is what this day could look like, based on what we did:\n10 \u2013 11 AM: Brooklyn Bridge.\n11 AM \u2013 12 PM: Brooklyn Heights, Old Pier 1.\n12 \u2013 1 PM: Lunch at Time Out Market.\n1 \u2013 2.30 PM: More time to explore Brooklyn.\n2.30 \u2013 3 PM: Manhattan Bridge.\n3 \u2013 5 PM: Chinatown and Tenement Museum.\n5.30 \u2013 7 PM:\nChinatown & Little Italy food tour\n.\nEvening: Empire State Building (optional, alternatively on day 6), or drinks at some rooftop bar.\nGood to know:\nIf you want to see Brooklyn Bridge without too many crowds, you could start your day earlier. That would also give you more time in Brooklyn if you prefer to explore more, do some shopping, etc.\nA note on Brooklyn street art.\nWe wanted to do\na Bushwick street art tour in Brooklyn\non this day. However, Brooklyn is huge and those tours run on a completely different side of the neighborhood which is easier to access from Manhattan. Plus, because of the time when these tours start, it\u2019s very difficult to fit this together on the same day as the Brooklyn Bridge area. So we did a street art tour on another day \u2013 see day 6 of our itinerary.\nChinatown.\nTenement Museum.\nChinatown.\nDAY 5\nMoMA, RADIO CITY or MADAME TUSSAUDS, GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL, SUMMIT ONE VANDERBILT.\nToday, we recommend going back to Midtown Manhattan (same area as on day 3) and exploring more. There is just so much to see and do here that you can easily fill another day here.\nWe recommend starting your day with a visit to the\nMuseum of Modern Art (MoMA)\n.\nBook the tickets\nfor the earliest time slot and plan to spend about 2 hours. You won\u2019t see everything, but it\u2019s enough for the highlights.\nAfterwards, you could choose one of the following attractions: a\nRadio City Music Hall Backstage Tour\nor visit\nMadame Tussauds\n. There is time for lunch before or after this, depending on your preference and the tickets/tours you choose.\nWe opted to visit the\nRadio City Music Hall\n, best known for its precision dancers Rockettes who perform on the\nRadio City Christmas Spectacular\nevery holiday season. The building is an Art Deco masterpiece and is such an iconic NYC venue. It has hosted so many legendary concerts and major events like the Grammys and MTV Music Awards. We had no idea what to expect of this backstage tour, but it was really worth it!\nAfterward, visit the\nGrand Central Terminal\n(or you can also have lunch here). You can just check out the main hall and the Grand Central Clock, but there is much history and iconic places to discover! We booked\nThe Official Grand Central Terminal Tour\nand were wowed by all the hidden treasures we would have never noticed on our own. Be sure to stop by\nThe Campbell\nfor some drinks!\nFinally, visit\nSUMMIT One Vanderbilt\nwhich is located just next to the station. This is one of the most modern and unique observation decks in Manhattan. Be sure to\nbook tickets in advance\nand plan about 1.5-2 hours for a visit.\nAfterward, you could walk to\nBryant Park\nand see the\nNew York Public Library\n. There are also many restaurants in that area for dinner. The restaurant we chose in Bryant Park was really not great so, unfortunately, I can\u2019t recommend anything specific.\nVincent van Gogh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u201cThe Starry Night\u201d at the MoMA.\nRadio City Music Hall.\nSUMMIT One Vanderbilt.\nThis is what this day could look like, based on what we did:\n10 AM \u2013 12 PM: MoMA (tickets).\n12.30 \u2013 1.30 PM:\nRadio City Music Hall Backstage Tour\n.\nLunch.\n3 \u2013 4.30 PM:\nThe Official Grand Central Terminal Tour\n.\n4.30 \u2013 5 PM: Drinks at The Campbell.\n5 \u2013 7 PM: SUMMIT One Vanderbilt (\nbook timed tickets in advance\n!).\nEvening: Bryant Park, New York Public Library, and dinner. Alternatively, a Broadway show or a sports game \u2013 see below.\nAlternative suggestions:\nDepending on your choices and the places you decide to visit, this could be quite a full day, or not at all. For example, if you are not interested in Radio City and are happy to just quickly see the Grand Central Terminal without taking a tour, you could have plenty of time left in the late afternoon/early evening.\nSo if you want to see another\nBroadway Show\nor maybe\na sports game by the New York Yankees, Mets, Knicks, or Giants\u2026\n, this day could be a good moment to fit it into your NYC itinerary.\nGrand Central Terminal.\nThe Campbell Bar at Grand Central Terminal.\nManhattan sunset view from SUMMIT One Vanderbilt.\nDAY 6\nEMPIRE STATE BUILDING, FLATIRON, UNION SQUARE, BROOKLYN STREET ART\n,\nGREENWICH VILLAGE\n.\nStart this day at the\nEmpire State Building\n. The most iconic skyscraper in New York, a visit here is really not to be missed!\nBook the earliest time slot\nto avoid the biggest crowds and upgrade to the 102nd floor for the most dazzling views in Manhattan.\nAfterward, walk south on 5th Avenue, pass\nMadison Square Park\n,\nFlatiron\n, and on to\nUnion Square\nwhere you can also check out a local market. From here, take a subway to the Bushwick neighborhood in Brooklyn for\na street art tour\n. It might look far but it\u2019s only 10-15 minutes by metro. You can have lunch in this quirky area too.\nAfter the tour, return to Manhattan and visit\nWashington Square\n. It\u2019s best known for the Washington Square Arch, but it\u2019s also just a really cool lively spot. On a nice sunny day, you will find many street entertainers here.\nNext, explore\nGreenwich Village\n. The \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 fans will want to see Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s House on Perry Street! This area is also great for boutique shopping.\nThe rest of this day really depends on your interests. See further below for our suggestions.\nViews from the Empire State Building.\nThe not-so-scary (but very cool) King Kong experience at the Empire State Building ;).\nFlatiron and Madison Square Park.\nThis is what this day could look like, based on what we did:\n9 \u2013 10.15 AM: Empire State Building (\nbook tickets\nfor the earliest time slot and arrive at least 10-15 minutes before it opens).\n10.15 \u2013 11.30 AM (can be done much quicker too): 5th Avenue, Madison Square Park, Flatiron, Union Square.\n11.30 AM \u2013 12.45 PM: Subway to Montrose Station and lunch in Brushwick.\n1 \u2013 2.30 PM:\nBushwick Street Art Tour\n(or a\ngraffiti workshop\nif you prefer).\n2.30 \u2013 3.30 PM: Back to Manhattan and walk to Washington Square.\n3.30 \u2013 4 PM: Greenwich Village.\nLate afternoon/evening: see recommendations below.\nAlternative suggestions:\nIf you didn\u2019t have enough time to explore everything we suggested on day 1, you can easily do it here. The High Line, Little Island, and Chelsea Market are just a short walk away from Greenwich Village.\nAlternatively, explore SOHO, which is a shoppers\u2019 paradise with lots of designer boutiques and famous brand stores concentrated in a rather small area. Here you can also visit the\nMuseum of Ice Cream\n. If you don\u2019t mind traveling further south for a photo, check out the Ghostbusters Headquarters, etc.\nJust as on day 5, this evening could also be used to see a show or a sports game.\nThere is so much cool street art in Brooklyn.\nOne of many street performers at Washington Square NYC\nPerry Street, Greenwich Village.\nDAY 7\nIf you have one more (half) day left in your New York itinerary, there are so many ways to fill it!\nYou can visit\nmore museums\n, like the\nAmerican Museum of Natural History\n, or some fun attractions like the\nFRIENDS\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 Experience\n\u2026 Book\na helicopter tour\n, take\na sunset sailing tour\n, do a\nBroadway behind-the-scenes tour\n, or join one or another\ntour of famous movie filming locations\n\u2026\nThere are literally hundreds of options! I recommend browsing around on\nthis tour/ticket website\nfor some ideas. Do something different, something that will make this New York trip even more memorable\nfor you\n!\nHere are a few additional suggestions for places beyond Manhattan, based on what we considered for our trip:\nHarlem and gospel concerts (half a day).\nIf you have ever dreamt of visiting the Harlem neighborhood and attending its famous gospel concerts, then don\u2019t miss the chance! In that case, you will have to adjust your itinerary and move some days around because most choirs only sing on certain days of the week. Usually, on Sundays, but some also on Saturdays and Wednesdays. See\nhere for the best tour options\n.\nConey Island\n(half a day).\nLocated in Brooklyn, about 1 hour by train from Manhattan, Coney Island is New York\u2019s beach destination. Here, you can enjoy sandy beaches, the iconic Riegelmann Boardwalk, the historic amusement park\nLuna Park\n, or Nathan\u2019s Famous hot dogs. With lively summer events and a vibrant atmosphere, Coney Island is a fun destination for those looking to experience a very different side of New York, especially in summer.\nIn the winter holiday season\n, you can even find quirky excursions like this\nDyker Heights Holiday Lights Bus Tour\n\u2026\nNiagara Falls (a VERY long day trip or 2 days).\nNiagara Falls is one of the most popular day trip destinations from New York City and there are many\nhighly-rated tours\nthat can bring you there. However, keep in mind that an excursion like this will require a VERY long day, so if you decide to do it, don\u2019t leave it for the last day of your itinerary. Alternatively, consider\na 2-day tour\n.\nConey Island in Brooklyn.\nCentral Perk Caf\u00c3\u00a9 at the FRIENDS Experience.\nNiagara Falls (American side).\nSome Practical Tips for Visiting NYC\nHere are a few practical tips to enjoy your week in New York and make the best of it:\nConsider\nflying\nto Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) \u2013 it\u2019s so much smaller than JFK and has a very easy and quick train connection directly to Penn Station.\nStay in central Manhattan.\nIt will make everything so much easier! We stayed at the\nFairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott New York Midtown Manhattan/Penn Station\nand also at\nVirgin Hotels New York City\n. The location of both of these is excellent.\nUse the\nsubway\nfor longer distances. It\u2019s so easy and quick. Plus, you don\u2019t have to worry about the tickets \u2013 just scan your credit card or smartphone wallet at the entrance and that\u2019s it.\nBook as much as possible in advance!\nIt will save you so much time everywhere.\nJoin a few guided tours!\nWe did quite a few guided tours in New York, and they made the trip so much more special. There is nothing like having a local guide with you! TIP \u2013 We booked most of the guided tours for this trip via\nWalks\n. We have been on dozens of tours with this organization all over Europe and now also in the USA, and they are always top-notch.\nIf you want to dine at specific\nrestaurants\n, do some research upfront and make reservations. My best tip is to look at Google Maps and choose the best-rated restaurants that are close to where you will be in the evening. There is no shortage of places to eat in NYC, but it\u2019s so busy everywhere.\nWear comfortable shoes and dress in layers.\nYou will be exploring from morning to evening, be sure that you are comfortable no matter what.\nCarry only things you really need.\nMost NYC attractions have airport-style security checks, plus, big bags aren\u2019t allowed in many places. The lighter you travel, the easier it will be! I also recommend swapping backpacks for\ncrossbody bags\n. I packed a crossbody bag and only had to leave it in a locker once, when visiting the Crown of the Statue of Liberty (due to a very narrow staircase).\nVirgin Hotels New York City\n.\nThis sums up our recommended 7-day New York itinerary.

I live in New York and will definitely be sending this article to visitors, because I find it difficult to summarize all there is to do here in the way you did it.\nA couple other tips:\nVisit the Upper West Side on a Sunday for the Grand Bazaar Flea Market and other pop-up stands on Columbus Ave. This combines well with the Natural History Museum. Peacefood cafe is a tasty vegan option in the area \u2013 even for non-vegans such as myself.\nWilliamsburg has a really interesting atmosphere and I find myself heading there on weekends and spending hours in awe. Domino Park and the waterfront are stunning with luxury developments, Hasidic Williamsburg feels like a different world, Bedford Ave has a youthful art scene, and there are many random little hole-in-the-wall shops that offer surprising finds.\nDoing a day trip (or even one night) in Niagara Falls is insane. It\u2019s a 6-8 hour drive \u2013 yikes.\nReply\nHi Joshua, thank you so much for your kind feedback and for the local tips. And yes, Niagara Falls is really not next door, but many people still do it \u2013 simply because it\u2019s their only chance to get there.\nReply\nGreat detail. Where would you recommend staying with a family please. Hoping to go December 2025 \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u009e\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bb\nReply\nHi Niccola, you didn\u2019t say how big your family is. Many hotels in NYC only have one bed (=2 people), but e.g.\nFairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott near Penn Station\nhas rooms with 2 double beds, so could be ok for a family of 3-4 people. We once stayed at this hotel, the room was very spacious, and the views were very nice too. The location is great.\nWarwick New York\nalso has spacious rooms for 4 people. The location is excellent.\nOn a lower budget,\nThe Cloud One New York-Downtown\ncould be a good option in Lower Manhattan.\nIf, however, your family is 5 people or more, then it gets trickier, unless you get two separate rooms. That said, there are some other options too, e.g.\nThe Fifty Sonesta Hotel New York\nhas a Junior Suite that can accommodate a family of 5.\nOn a higher budget, check out\nHotel Beacon\n, with 1 and 2-bedroom suites.\nThere are more options for various budgets. We always use Booking.com to look for the best options for our family. Insert your travel dates, number of people, and you will see what\u2019s possible. You can then also click on the map to search for the best options in the specific area. Just book well ahead, especially if traveling around Christmas \u2013 New Year.\nIf budget isn\u2019t an issue, I recommend staying in Midtown Manhattan, more or less between Penn Station and Central Park. Or a bit outside of this area, but no more than 5-10 minutes walk from a metro station. It makes a big difference because all the main sights are really close by and you can use the metro for places that are further away. Penn Station is also easy to reach by train from the main airports so if you stay near the station (e.g. Fairfield Inn I linked to above), you don\u2019t even have to take a metro or a taxi with all your luggage.\nHope this helps.\nReply\n@Jurga, Thank you! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really helpful x\nReply\nGreat itinerary. We are visiting New York in the fall and will have 8.5 days. What do you recommend?\nReply\nHi Karen, you could pretty much follow our itinerary as it is and I would add\na two-day tour to Niagara Falls\n. If you still have some extra time, go shopping! There are so many great shopping opportunities in NYC.\nReply\nWow!!  Thanks for being so thorough.  And for giving detailed tips & reminders.  Best I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen for NYC.\nThanks\nReply\nThank you for your kind feedback, Marty. Enjoy New York!\nReply\nHi Jurga,\nWe are heading to NYC end of August for a vacation. You have just made all the planning so easy with your awesome itinerary.\nLast trip to Venice and Greece was outstanding taking all your tips.\nThank you again,\nAsh\nReply\nWhat a great timing indeed, Ashley!

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stayed at\nCitizenM Bankside\n, and we loved it. It was actually our first CitizenM stay, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve since stayed at three of their other locations around the world (if that tells you anything about how our experience went). I also stayed at\nNative Bankside\non my latest trip, a modern aparthotel with kitchen facilities in each room, which we also liked for a longer stay (I like to have more space because I do a lot of my best writing on location).\nIf it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your first time in London, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go wrong with\nCovent Garden\n. Covent Garden is akin to the Centro Storico in Rome or Florence (or any Italian city, really) or Le Marais in Paris. Not because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the oldest part of the city (that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the City of London), but because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the beating heart of the city in a lot of ways. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s central, well connected, and will put you in a perfect position to explore the adjacent neighborhoods on foot and zip around the city on public transit. Stay at\nPage8\n(which is literally across from the National Gallery) if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a hip boutique hotel, or at the\nZ Hotel Covent Garden\nif you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for something more affordable. For more space, look at\nCove Arne Street\n, an aparthotel we almost stayed at (but chose the City of London location below instead).\nIf it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a short trip and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for the most convenient location, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go with the\nCity of London\n.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stayed here multiple times now, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily the most charming part of the city, it is certainly among the most convenient. Which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprising considering that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essentially London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Financial District, and thus has great connections to most parts of the city (including, crucially, London Heathrow). If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a hotel with a good value, take a look at the\nCity of London Club\n. If you want a little more space, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stayed at both\nCove Cannon Street\nand\nNative King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wardrobe\n, two nice aparthotels a few blocks from St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cathedral which would be a great choice.\nIf you want to stay in the hippest part of the city with great food, drinks, and nightlife, stay in\nShoreditch / Spitalfields\n.\nThe markets here are must-visits \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Spitalfields Market, Brick Lane, and the Sunday Upmarket \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the area has a great blend of location and vibes (it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all skaters and street art).\nOne Hundred Shoreditch\nis the place to stay to be in the middle of all the action in Shoreditch, and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a unique experience, there are two pubs with rooms above them that would be a fun way to spend a few nights in London (\nthe Culpeper\nand\nthe Buxton\n).\nImportant Tips for Visiting London\nHere are some tips and tricks for planning your visit to London that are probably most helpful for first timers.\nAs Americans, traveling to London is noticeably different than traveling to other places in Europe, like Italy or Portugal, due to the absence of a language barrier.\nIt feels much more similar to home, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really not. There are certainly cultural and practical differences that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to know going in.\nHere are a few things that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned about London to keep in mind as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning your trip.\nEarly Mornings are Best for the Main Sights\nFor sights like St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cathedral, the Tower of London, and Westminster Abbey, try to get there when they open. Especially on a Sunday.\nAlysha went on a solo trip to the Tower of London (Matt has been multiple times before) and was surprised at how empty it was on a Sunday morning!\nWe had the same experience on a Thursday morning at St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cathedral.\nIn the summer, it will still be busy in the morning, but not\nas\nbusy as midday or later in the afternoon.\nLondon is Massive\nWe LOVE walking around cities, and think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best way to experience a city. But if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being honest, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nearly impossible to walk around London \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just too big!\nWe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite understand just how massive London is until we had spent some time moving around it.\nI mean, sure, we knew it was a huge city with 10 million people, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we quite understood just how long it takes to get from one end of the city to the other.\nThe good news is that the public transportation network in London is excellent. You can use the buses and the Tube (the Underground) to zip around the city.\nPublic Transportation is Both Expensive and 100% Worth it\nGetting around London using the Tube is fast, efficient, and is absolutely something you should take advantage of.\nA lot of people balk at the \u00c2\u00a36 per ride cost of riding the Tube in London, but if you dig a little deeper, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely worth it.\nThe alternative to public transportation is taking a taxi or rideshare, which is more expensive.\nAnd, though you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only in London for four days, a weeklong unlimited transit pass is just \u00c2\u00a338.70, which means it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00c2\u00a310 a day for unlimited access (plus \u00c2\u00a35 for an Oyster card).\nFor that reason (p.s., the answer can be well over an hour, depending on where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re headed),\nwe highly recommend investing in an unlimited public transportation card while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in London\n, which is called a Travelcard and is something you can buy at the machines at most Tube stations.\nThe Travelcard gives you unlimited access to the Underground and buses in London.\nBoth are efficient, relatively clean (coming from the US), and will get you from point A to point B far faster than your own two feet.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to choose the duration based on your trip \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one day, two days, a week. More information\nhere\n.\nSince you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll likely only need zones 1-2 for most of the sights in Central London, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend purchasing your Travelcard separately from your trip from the airport, if you choose to take the Tube from Heathrow.\nThe airport is outside of that range, and it would increase the price of your pass substantially.\nTop Travel Tip:\nUse the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTFL\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Transport for London) app\non the Apple or Google Play store for an app with a wealth of maps, timetables and transport information.\nThe Museums are Mostly Free (!)\nUnlike most other cities, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to shell out a lot of money to visit the museums, the main museums in London are free.\nIn high season, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to make a reservation for a timed entry in advance to make sure you can get in.\nWe love this aspect of London, because it makes it so that you can poke your head in, see if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nreally\ninterested in something, and then decide to opt out if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not for you without the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe just spent \u00c2\u00a330 on this, I guess we have to stick it out\u00e2\u0080\u009d guilt.\nThey Drive on the Other Side of the Road\nWe, of course, knew this going in, but that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop us from nearly getting run over on our first few days in London on both of our most recent visits.\nLuckily, in the center of London, there are helpful \u00e2\u0080\u009clook left / right\u00e2\u0080\u009d signs on the ground at crosswalks, which saved our lives multiple times.\nWhen in doubt, look both ways. Three times.\nSpecific Days of the Week to Keep in Mind for Your Trip\nOne of the things we realized as we sat down to outline this guide is that a lot of the things to do depend on what days of the week you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in town.\nThis is particularly relevant for some of the food markets.\nFor example, Borough Market is packed on Saturday, closed on Sunday, and great on weekdays. But only at lunchtime!\nOn the other hand, Broadway Market up north is really a Saturday (or Sunday, but Saturday is better) destination, when the streets are packed with vendors selling all kinds of delicious food.\nHere are some considerations for days of the week to keep in mind as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning your trip (there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more detail on what exactly these places are and what they offer in the detailed itinerary below).\nBorough Market:\nLunch only, Monday to Saturday.\nBroadway Market:\nDefinitely go on Saturday for lunch.\nCamden Market:\nMostly a lunch spot, and you should also go on Saturday if you can.\nSpitalfields Market:\nWeekends are best here, when the entire interior is lined with stalls selling food, arts and crafts, and other fun stuff to peruse.\nPortobello Road Market:\nThe market in Notting Hill is, again, best on Saturdays, when the majority of vendors are set up.\nColumbia Road Flower Market:\nSundays only!\nThe Sunday Upmarket:\nThe vintage/food market on Brick Lane is a weekends only destination, both Saturday and Sunday.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWOW\u00e2\u0080\u009d you say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a LOT of weekend only markets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which ones do you like best?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIf we had to choose, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d opt for the\nBroadway Market\n, which feels much more like a neighborhood farmers market than any other market we visited (and we went twice!), and the\nSpitalfields Market and Upmarket\n, which are a few blocks away from each other.\nYou should also definitely visit Camden Market and Borough Market, but the day of the week matters less for those (though they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both lunchtime destinations, rather than evening destinations).\n4 Days in London: A Perfect Itinerary for First Timers\nNow that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve covered some of the logistics and other things that are good to know before your trip, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get into exactly how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d spend 4 days exploring the city.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot to do and see in London.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to be able to see it all with just four days (even with two trips spanning more than three weeks, we had to scrap a couple of day trips because we felt like the city deserved more of our time).\nOur goal with this itinerary is to help you decide what to do in London, and to give you a mix of the traditional tourist sights \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the museums, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, etc. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and some of the less visited places that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it on every tourist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s radar, but we found to be worth the time and effort.\nWe have a secret for you. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lesson that it took us years of traveling to finally learn on our three month European extravaganza a few years ago.\nTravel is better \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and by better, we mean more rewarding, interesting, and fun \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when you try your best to connect with locals to see the place through their eyes.\nI (Matt here!) took that to heart on my last visit to London in an effort to better understand what makes the city special, and came away with a much richer understanding of London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique culture and point of view on life.\nParticularly on that latest trip, I did a bunch of different tours and experiences (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve included the ones that I thought were particularly special in the guide below) that opened my eyes to a new side of the city, culture, and people.\nOur biggest tip for London (or any city, really) is to prioritize tours that connect you with locals and allow you to get a unique perspective on the city (which is what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see in this itinerary).\nIn terms of structure, we always do our best to anchor the days in our itineraries around a main experience, with time on either side for things like coffee, cocktails, and good old fashioned wandering around a neighborhood.\nAnd we never, ever do multiple museums in a single day\n.\nTrust us and learn from our mistakes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you WILL be exhausted by the time you get to the second one, and will get a lot less out of it.\nTo make the most out of your trip to London, plan to do one or two major sights a day, and dedicate the rest to walking around the neighborhoods while leaving yourself energy to go out for a drink and a show in the evenings.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an overview of the 4 day itinerary you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find below:\nDay 1:\nThe City of London and Shoreditch\nDay 2:\nWestminster, the West End, and a Museum\nDay 3:\nSouthbank and the Tower of London\nDay 4:\nA Foray into North London (Camden and Notting Hill)\nBelow the detailed itinerary, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find some suggestions on what to do with more or less time on your trip to London, including options for compressing this itinerary into one, two, or three days.\nOne other thing to know:\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to (many) give specific recommendations on places to eat for two reasons\n.\nOne, Matt has Celiac Disease and traditional British food is tough if you need to eat gluten free (luckily, there are a bunch of other cuisines all over London), so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not really the right people to give that advice (except for the best\ngluten free restaurants in London\n, which we have plenty of opinions about).\nTwo, it depends so much on your tastes and budget. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let you figure that out on your own, for the most part.\nDay 1: The City of London and Shoreditch\nOn the first day of your trip to London, start in the oldest part of the city (which, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover below, actually feels like the newest part) to gain an understanding of where the city started, and how it got to where it is today.\nAlong the way, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn about the origins of London.\nMost historians think London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history starts with the Roman settlement, but there were certainly people here before that.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll visit St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cathedral, the London Museum, and take a walk through the \u00e2\u0080\u009cold town\u00e2\u0080\u009d before spending your afternoon and evening in the part of London that is definitely not the old town \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Shoreditch (which is the hip spot to be with great bars and restaurants of all kinds).\nImportant itinerary note:\nSpitalfields Market and the Upmarket are best on the weekends, which means you should do your best to have this day fall on a weekend. In particular,\nthis would make an excellent Sunday itinerary (minus St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, which is closed Sunday).\nSt. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cathedral\nSt. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cathedral is one of the more interesting aspects of London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history, and the archaeologist who led our excellent walking tour (we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d highly recommend it if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in the history of London \u00e2\u0080\u0093\nhere it is\n) remarked that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably the single most important building in all of London when it comes to the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history.\nWhy, you ask? A couple of reasons.\nThere are two times in London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history that the city has essentially been leveled.\nThe first was in the late 17th Century, when a fire started at a bakery on \u00e2\u0080\u009cPudding Lane\u00e2\u0080\u009d (yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually the name of the street where all the bakeries were) and ended up burning down something like two thirds of the City of London.\nThen, during the Blitz in World War 2 when a huge portion of Central London was reduced to rubble, the dome of St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stood strong, serving as an important symbol of the resilience of the city in the face of adversity.\nIn both cases, St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cathedral played an important role in the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s healing and coping with the disasters.\nIt was built after the fire as a sort of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeather in the cap\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the government at the time. We learned on the walking tour that it was very much a political symbol more than a religious one, one that said \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rebuilding London, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing it right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe truth is that German bombers could recognize the dome from above, and did their best to avoid it (though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not quite sure how possible that really was given the technology at the time).\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend heading up to the dome of St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and being the first ones up there if you can swing it.\nThe dome access starts at 9:30 am, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long climb up a variety of different staircases to reach the top.\nThere are three levels on the way up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Whispering Gallery (the interior of the dome), the Stone Gallery (the exterior of the base of the dome), and the Golden Gallery (at the tippy top of the dome).\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth stopping at all three, and definitely go all the way to the top, where the views are outstanding!\nMake sure to visit the crypt, where two important figures in British history are buried.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find the Duke of Wellington (famous for leading British forces in the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo) and Lord Admiral Nelson (also famous for outwitting Napoleon, among other things), among others.\nEntry is a little pricey, but we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth the money. To save money, you can book tickets online in advance for a slight discount, which saves you a few pounds a person.\nMore information on hours, costs, and more\nhere\n. Monday to Saturday only, closed on Sundays for service.\nOne New Change\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rooftop Terrace\nAfter you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done the cathedral itself, head up the sixth floor free\nrooftop terrace of One New Change\n, a fancy shopping center across the street, for one of the best views of the dome in all of London.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely free, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open from 6:00 am to midnight every day. You take the elevator from the middle of the building up to the terrace, and from there you have an unobstructed view of the dome of St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\nYou can find information on the terrace, including opening hours,\nhere\n.\nThe London Museum\nHead directly north from the cathedral up to the excellent (and free)\nLondon Museum\n.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth taking an hour (or two, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really into it) to peruse the museum, which covers the history of the city from prehistoric times to modern times in chronological order, weaving a story about the history of London and how it came to be the city it is today.\nWe enjoyed this museum, and we learned a lot about British history and the history of the city that we definitely had never thought about before.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you two examples.\nFirst is the fact that, for large swaths of its history, London was under the control of outsiders. As Americans, we never really think of the British as being colonized and oppressed, but that is certainly how they spent the bulk of history before the medieval periods.\nFirst it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Romans, then they leave and the Saxons move in, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Normans.\nSecond is the fact that London, the cosmopolitan city that we know and love today, was shaped by two disasters (which we already touched on above) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the fire in the 17th Century that burned the majority of the city (which at the time, was mostly wood) to the ground, and the Blitz during World War 2.\nWithout those two events, the modernization of London would have been much more difficult, and Central London would likely look very, very different from how it does today.\nWe enjoyed the museum, and think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice short way to get an understanding of the history of the city before diving into what it is today.\nImportant note:\nThe museum is closed for renovations in 2025, and is set to reopen in 2026. Unfortunate because it was one of our favorite discoveries on our recent trip to London.\nAn Afternoon and Evening in Shoreditch\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen a higher concentration of vintage stores than we saw in Shoreditch.\nAnd that tells you a lot about this hip neighborhood in northeast London and the transformation it has undergone in the past decade or so.\nAt one point, Shoreditch was completely separate from the city of London, but over the years the borders of London have continually expanded, swallowing up former suburbs on its way to becoming the city it is today.\nEven the origin story of Shoreditch is a little counterculture.\nIt became famous because in the 16th Century, some politicians got the idea that banning playhouses (and theaters) in London sounded like a good idea. You know, to remain chaste and godly and all that.\nImagine what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think if they saw London today!\nSo, in order to meet the demand that certainly hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t evaporated despite the ban, new theaters were built in places like Shoreditch and Southwark, which at the time were outside of the city limits, and thus its jurisdiction.\nIn the 19th and early 20th Centuries, it was a legitimate rival to the West End as the center of London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arts scene.\nAfter the second world war, during which large swaths of the neighborhood were demolished \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including a lot of housing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the reconstruction process took a little longer than other parts of London.\nSince then, the story of Shoreditch is similar to many other highly gentrified areas in major cities around the world.\nFirst the artists moved in, creating a demand for businesses that those artists liked, and finally ending with astronomical housing prices that drove out many of the original residents (and those artists, too) and brought in a more wealthy contingent, who in turn brought a different set of businesses to cater to their different needs.\nOn your way from the City of London to Shoreditch, there are a bunch of stops worth making, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to give you a few to start.\nStart with a rooftop drink at the\nroof garden at the Culpeper\n, make your way to\nOld Spitalfields Market\nto wander the stalls with art, food, and drinks (weekends only), and then head over to Brick Lane, stopping by\nthe Upmarket\nif this happens to fall on a weekend, and follow Brick Lane north into Shoreditch.\nDay 2: Westminster, the West End, and a Museum\nOn your second day in London, start your day in the city of Westminster, make your way to Covent Garden, and head through Hyde Park to check out a museum (there are two choices here, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve outlined below).\nWestminster is a relatively small patch of London, but contains a higher concentration of London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s famous spots than anywhere else in the city, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d try to\nbeat the crowds and head out early\n.\nBut First, Coffee!\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for some of the\nbest coffee in London\n, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in luck \u00e2\u0080\u0093 two of our favorites are within a few blocks of each other near Westminster Abbey, which is where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be starting your day today.\nThe first, and our overall top recommendation in London for coffee nerds (like me, Matt), is\nNostos Coffee\n.\nThey have your usual drinks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 lattes and Americanos and the like \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but they also have an incredible special menu featuring pour over coffee and single origin espresso from some of my favorite roasters in Europe.\nWe came here multiple times on our latest trip because both the coffee and the service were among the best we found in London.\nThe second, and another of my favorites, is\nFormative Coffee\n.\nFormative is more focused on espresso, and they have five or six different coffees available as espresso on any given day, with a couple of filter coffee options (batch brew) alongside them.\nWe not only had some really fun coffees \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a white honey gesha that the owner used in the World Barista Championships and a weird green apple co-fermented coffee that was like drinking one of those caramel apple lollipops we had as kids \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but the baristas went out of their way to give us advice about London (and specifically where else to go in London for great coffee).\nThe freeze distilled flat white at Nostos\nBetween those two, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be in great hands in terms of your morning caffeination (and ready to start your day in earnest).\nWestminster Bridge and Big Ben\nThe first stop of the day should be the eastern end of Westminster Bridge, across the river from Big Ben (\nhere\non Google Maps).\nYou might be tempted to go straight to Westminster station, but we think the walk over the bridge is well worth it because of the excellent view of Big Ben you get as you cross the bridge.\nThe world famous tower, officially known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cElizabeth Tower\u00e2\u0080\u009d, houses the giant bell affectionately known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cBig Ben\u00e2\u0080\u009d, whose unmistakable chime has sounded across the city for over 150 years.\nBig Ben refers to the bell, not the tower itself.\nTo hear the bell going off, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to be on the bridge about 10 minutes before the turn of the hour (so, 8:50 am to hear the 9:00 am bells).\nEither side of the bridge works fine, but the better view is going to be from the southern end of the bridge.\nAs of the time of writing, Big Ben has been under construction for several years, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely to be some scaffolding up around it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a great view, though.\nAt the other side of the bridge, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find yourself adjacent to the Houses of Parliament.\nYou can actually visit the Houses of Parliament and take a guided tour that allows you to access parts of the complex you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ordinarily be able to.\nIf that sounds interesting to you, you can find more information\nhere\n(it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 90 minute tour, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fairly pricey).\nWestminster Abbey\nWalk across the square in front of parliament \u00e2\u0080\u0093 make sure to walk by the statues of famous Brits like Winston Churchill \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on your way over to\nWestminster Abbey\n, which is your first stop of the morning.\nThis is a gigantic Gothic Cathedral that was built in the 13th Century by Henry III as both a monument to Edward the Confessor, and as a final resting place for his own body.\nThe history from there is kind of fascinating, mostly because of the intermingling of the monarchy and church over the course of centuries.\nOn a walking tour, the history professor leading the tour (we did\nthis walking tour\nand really enjoyed it) said that, essentially, the church was very, very rich, and the monarchy said something to the effect of \u00e2\u0080\u009cyeah, we want in on that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhich I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure is painting with broad strokes and missing a lot of historical nuance.\nBut on the other hand, yeah, that checks out.\nEssentially, in the mid 15th Century, Henry VIII (yes, that one, the one that enjoyed beheading his wives) got mad at the Catholic Church for not signing off on his divorce.\nSo, naturally, he seized all assets owned by the church and took control of them for himself. Often, selling off pieces of them to fund his various adventures around Europe.\nFrom there, the royal family and the church became intertwined. Divine right and all that jazz.\nToday, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the site of royal weddings, coronation ceremonies, and burials, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly a tourist attraction.\nMore than 3,000 Brits are buried in Westminster Abbey \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the most famous being many of the royals of the last few centuries, and people like Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin.\nMake sure to look down as you walk around the interior \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it seems like every step you take inside of the Abbey, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re walking onto a new burial site with the name and dates of their life/death.\nThe Abbey opens at 9:30 am (9:00 am on Saturdays, closed on Sundays), which is pretty early, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend trying to be one of the first people in the door.\nTo do that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d buy\nonline tickets in advance\n, which go on sale two months in advance.\nBuckingham Palace (and the Changing of the Guard)\nFrom Westminster Abbey, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice walk through St. James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Park to get to\nBuckingham Palace\n, which is where the King supposedly lives (but spends almost zero time there these days, according to multiple people we talked to).\nSide note:\nWhat the heck is going on with that \u00e2\u0080\u009cs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the end of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSt. James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Park\u00e2\u0080\u009d? Yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the correct spelling. We had to quadruple check.\nThis is also where the most \u00e2\u0080\u009ctouristy\u00e2\u0080\u009d activity on this entire itinerary happens \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Changing of the Guard.\nThat being said, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite the spectacle (we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe this still happens, to be completely honest) and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth seeing once, as long as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re prepared for the crowds and have the flexibility to show up a little early at a specific time on a specific day.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to pay close attention to the\nofficial schedule\nfor this one, as the ceremony schedule varies by the season.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also need to plan your day to arrive here by at least 10:45 am, and probably a lot earlier if you want to get a good view, especially during the summer.\nTrafalgar Square and the West End\nAt some point during their London visit, virtually everyone\nends up at\nTrafalgar Square\n. Probably because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right in the middle of all the action.\nTo get there from the palace, just walk straight out \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Mall\u00e2\u0080\u009d and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll land at the southern end of the square after you walk under the Admiralty Arch.\nThe square is home to Nelson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Column, dedicated to the beloved naval hero of the same name who outwitted Napoleon multiple times, Trafalgar Square has been a huge draw for tourists, locals, and flocks of pigeons since Victorian times.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an\nexcellent view back towards Big Ben\nfrom the south end of the square. And lots of lions.\nWhat is it about lions that makes every single king or queen go \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat animal do I want to be? Yeah, a lion, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhy not switch it up and get creative every once in a while and be a warthog or a water buffalo or something?\nSeven Dials Market for Lunch and Exploring Covent Garden\nAnother food market! Hooray!\nSeriously though, our favorite part of London was all the incredible food markets, which is pretty evident in our construction of this itinerary. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically a different food market every single day!\nToday, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the\nSeven Dials Market\n, a food hall housed in a former warehouse in Covent Garden.\nWe were confused by the banana logo that we saw all over the building, and it turns out this warehouse was primarily used to store bananas back in the day, hence the logo. And cucumbers, too!\nThere are a ton of good food options here, and we have one specific recommendation,\nChai Guys\n, which is some of the best chai that Alysha had in London (she LOVES chai, and these guys / gals do it right!). Get the kadak, which is a sweeter, creamier version.\nThe area around the market is also worth exploring.\nHistoric and elegant Covent Garden, situated in London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s West End, is probably our favorite part of central London.\nBut Covent Garden was absolutely not always the manicured, tourist-friendly district that you find today.\nIn fact, we learned on our tour of the National Portrait Gallery (more on that in a second) that it was basically the Red Light District for most of its history, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a recent development that it has become relatively posh.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth a stop at the Apple Market to see it at its poshest, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find a bunch of luxury stores inside a historic produce market.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in a crash course in Covent Garden history, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend\nthis walking tour\nwith the company who we did our National Portrait Gallery tour with. I wanted to do this on my latest trip, but the timing didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work out to make it happen.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough to do in Covent Garden to last an entire day, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a lot to see, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say that you should get some food, do some wandering around the Seven Dials and Neal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Yard areas, and move on.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some good shopping, some great coffee (\nMonmouth\n, in particular), and we enjoyed\nNeal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Yard Dairy\n, where we picked out a couple of English cheeses to enjoy later with some excellent fig jam.\nChoose Your Own Museum Adventure\nWe love the fact that most of London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s museums are completely free, which is something we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to see happen at home more often because it makes it so much more accessible \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to wander around for seven hours trying to make the most of the $40 you spent on admission, you can just see what you want to see and leave.\nHowever, you should know going in that it does mean that these museums are going to be CROWDED at peak hours (think the middle of the day).\nYou can and should make a reservation to visit if you can.\nA couple of notes here before we get to the two museums we would recommend focusing on.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to focus on museums that say something meaningful about the history of London and the U.K. more broadly,\nwhich means the National Gallery and Natural History Museum are out.\nBoth could very well be in any major city around the world.\nWe also would absolutely NOT recommend the Churchill War Rooms\n, which are not free (and are relatively expensive) and absolutely made their way onto my \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most overrated tourist attractions in the world\u00e2\u0080\u009d list.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just one big propaganda campaign about how great of a guy Winston Churchill was (spoiler: he, uh, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t) without any nuance or acknowledgment of his flaws.\nHe was definitely a war hero, but that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come without any downsides.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really interested in the World War 2 stuff, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d highly recommend heading to the\nImperial War Museums\nacross the river, which is both free and offers a much more balanced look at the war (plus an exhibit on the First World War, too).\nWhich means there are two museums \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both near Covent Garden \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that we think would make a good stop for your afternoon; the National Portrait Gallery, and the British Museum.\nOption 1: The British Museum\nWe actually went to the British Museum on our previous trip to London, and left within 30 minutes or so.\nFor two reasons.\nFirst, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a particularly well thought out museum \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how could it be with so many different time periods and culture covered \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of all over the place.\nWe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where to start, so we started with the Egyptian artifacts, which leads me to the second reason.\nSecond, this is all stolen stuff.\nImagine this for a second: you walk into a museum in Egypt and find the remains of the British Royal Family on display for the world to see. Do we think that would go over well?\nWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and the cultural voyeurism felt a little strange to us.\nHowever, like I alluded to above, the British Museum DOES tell an important story about the history of the U.K., London, and the British Empire, so I was determined to\nAfter a bunch of research into different tours, I stumbled across\nthis guided tour with Daniel\nthat I immediately fell in love with (and booked) because it tackles the issues with the British Museum head on.\nIt was a great way to go through the museum, and felt more like a conversation than a lecture. We talked about the artifacts we were looking at, their significance to the culture they actually belong to, and how they ended up in the Museum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection.\nWe also learned about all of the controversy around giving things back (spoiler: they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for various reasons).\nAll that being said, there really are some cultural treasures from India, China, and Egypt in this museum, along with a tiny collection of things from the British Isles (which is kind of funny \u00e2\u0080\u0093 usually you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect that section to be bigger).\nIt just comes with a bunch of complicated questions and concerns that are hard to process without an expert helping you work through them.\nAnd we think thinking about those complications is an important part of visiting this museum.\nThe museum itself is free, though lines can get extremely long (which is the security line) at peak hours. Leave the bags at home and head to the back entrance (\nhere\non Google Maps) to skip that line BUT you can only do that if you do not have bags.\nOption 2: The National Portrait Gallery\nNot to be confused with the National Gallery, which is kind of just a run-of-the-mill art museum, the National Portrait Gallery is a collection of, you guessed it, portraits of various mediums and time periods that tell a story about the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history.\nPortraits ranging from regal interpretations of George the III (of Hamilton fame) to various abolitionists and suffragettes (and everything in between) adorn the walls, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really a clear narrative, which makes it a little hard to wrap your head around.\nOn this last trip, we opted to do a guided tour here (with aforementioned\nRebel Tours\n) and really enjoyed it.\nWe spent a couple of hours getting a crash course in British history, with a mix of the mainstream history featuring kings and queens, and some lesser known but equally important figures like the suffragettes and abolitionists who shaped the United Kingdom as we know it today.\nThey also have free tours of the gallery at 12:00pm and 3:00 pm (at the time of writing) that cover the highlights in 45 minutes.\nOur last recommendation if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do the tour we recommended above is to bring your own headphones so that you can take advantage of the\ndigital guide\n, which you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use on your own phone.\nVisiting the museum is free, but it is recommended that you make a free online booking in advance of showing up.\nThe gallery is also open late on Fridays and Saturdays, which would be a nice relatively quiet time to enjoy the museum.\nWandering Hyde Park\nAfter a history lesson, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to get outside and get some fresh air. Make your way towards the southeastern corner of\nHyde Park\n.\nTo get there, you can either walk down Oxford Street through Soho, which is similar to Times Square in New York or the Champs-\u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es in Paris, or you can hop on the Tube (Piccadilly Line) and get off at Hyde Park Corner station, which is at the southeastern corner of the park.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend starting at that corner of the park because you get to see the Wellington Arch, which commemorates the Duke of Wellington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defeat of Napoleon.\nSide note: Everybody has a victory arch \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the many victory arches in Rome around the Forum, everybody gets an arch!\nThen, as you enter the park, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re immediately confronted with the rose garden, which is cool (although it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be blooming in the winter and fall).\nSpend some time wandering through the park, checking out the Serpentine (that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the lake) and the Serpentine Waterfall (\nhere\non Google Maps), a particularly pretty section of greenery.\nDay 3: Southbank and the Tower of London\nOn your third day, start off bright and early at the Tower of London, then make your way across the Tower Bridge to start a walk along the south bank of the Thames down to Westminster Bridge, with plenty of stops along the way (including a stop at Borough Market for lunch).\nImportant itinerary note:\nSince Borough Market is closed Sundays, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d make sure this day lands on any day but Sunday.\u00a0Ideally a weekday, because Borough Market is wild on Saturdays (many friends in London told me not to go on a weekend).\nThe Tower of London\nOn my latest trip to London, I spent my first morning solo awaiting the arrival of my brother, and I decided to tackle the Tower of London that morning so that I had something to do while I was jet lagged and tired.\nAt that point, I had already done the Tower of London twice before \u00e2\u0080\u0093 never on a tour \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and I realized as I was walking through the room displaying the Crown Jewels that I actually had no recollection of ever seeing them before, despite having done it twice.\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably because we spent only about an hour on each visit, which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really enough time to understand what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at.\nOn this last trip, I decided to do\nthis guided tour at opening\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 which includes the Ceremony of the Keys where the Yeoman Warders unlock the Tower for the day \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to spend a little more time understanding what exactly I was looking at, and I enjoyed it and it definitely gave me a deeper understanding of the significance.\nIt also meant that we were literally third in line to enter the building where the Crown Jewels are held, which was cool.\nApparently in peak times there are LONG lines to get into that building, but we basically had it to ourselves.\nWhether you do the tour or not, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d highly, HIGHLY recommend visiting the Tower of London first thing in the morning.\nAnd we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go a step further and say your first stop should be the Crown Jewels.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a popular tourist attraction, and we were totally expecting it to be crowded early on a weekend morning when we showed up.\nBut, somehow, when the doors opened, it was miraculously empty, save for a few other groups.\nGet there at opening time if you can. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the place largely to yourself, and it will get more and more crowded over the morning.\nAnyway, what is the Tower?\nThe Tower of London\nsits at the southeastern corner of the town of Londinium, which was established by the Romans.\nThe tower as we know it today was built in the 11th Century by William the Conqueror as a fortress, and has served a wide variety of purposes since its construction, including as a royal palace and, probably most famously, as a notorious prison.\nWhen you really get into it, the history of the Tower of London is pretty dark.\nThere were so many people executed and tortured here that there are more than three different areas that are marked as places of execution in and around the tower.\nTower Bridge from inside the Tower of London\nMostly, it was political opponents who were executed for trumped up crimes to get them out of the picture.\nMultiple members of the royal family have also died within the walls of the Tower, including Henry VI and a pair of princes who disappeared (and were later confirmed to have been buried in the tower).\nSince its construction, it has been constantly added to and expanded.\nToday, the main attractions you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to focus on are the\nCrown Jewels\n,\nthe ramparts\n, and the\nWhite Tower\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 the big castle-looking structure in the middle of the complex.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a different tour, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d highly recommend joining one of the\nYeoman Warder tours\n, which happen every 30 minutes and are included in the price of entry.\nMore information, including prices and current hours, is available\nhere\n.\nTower Bridge\nTo get to your next destination \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the south bank of the Thames \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to cross the river. You have two options here, and both have their advantages.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend crossing over Tower Bridge\n, which was built in the late 19th Century and is probably the most iconic of London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bridges.\nYou probably think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s London Bridge, a confusion that many tourists (including my brother, Connor) make, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually the next bridge down the river (and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a gray concrete slab).\nThe Twin Towers, connected by a walkway (we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that in a second), is one of the main elements of architecture that people think of when they think of London.\nAlthough, as the archaeologist who led our\nexcellent walking tour of London\npointed out, most people think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the London Bridge.\nWe would NOT recommend going up to the top of the bridge, which used to be a legitimate mode of transportation for pedestrians to cross when the drawbridge was up to let boats through, but has shamelessly been turned into a tourist attraction.\nThe alternative is crossing\nLondon Bridge\n, which is west of the Tower of London.\nThe advantage? A picture perfect view of Tower Bridge. The downside? The bridge is kind of boring in terms of architecture.\nPlus, one of the best views of the City of London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skyline is from the river level just west of Tower Bridge on the south bank.\nHere, you get a great view of the bridge, and also a nice view of the Tower of London and City of London across the river.\nLunch at Borough Market\nBorough Market\n, dating back (almost unbelievably) to before the 12th Century, is one of the largest and oldest markets in the city.\nDespite being crowded and very touristy, Borough Market is one of our favorite places in the city, full stop.\nHowever,\nwe would caution you about coming here on a weekend\n, which is when the number of people here peaks and it is a ZOO.\nAvoid making this day your Saturday (or Sunday, when the market is closed), if you can.\nThere are a couple of sections of the market, not to mention the countless bars and restaurants lining the streets around the market.\nYou should know that\nBorough Market is VERY MUCH a lunch destination \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it closes in the late afternoon\n. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closed all day on Sunday, so make sure this falls on any other day of the week.\nEssentially, the market is split into two main sections: the ready-to-eat food section (which is where you should eat lunch), and the gourmet food items section.\nThe latter features stands selling everything from English cheese, to tea, to all things Italian, and just about everything else a foodie could dream of.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for coffee,\nMonmouth Coffee\nis great, and has a location right outside the western edge of the market (\nhere\non Google Maps).\nTake some time to wander through that section of the market and, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready for food, head over to the section with all the food stalls for lunch.\nWe found ourselves here not once, not twice, but three different times over the course of our time in London.\nHere are the places we fell in love with, in no particular order.\nKhanom Krok\n:\nOne of my favorite meals in London on this last trip was the pad thai from this stand at Borough Market, with the mango sticky rice for dessert. I returned a second time to try their Massaman curry, too, which was almost equally delicious (I still prefer the pad thai). Make sure to squeeze plenty of lime!\nThe Black Pig\n:\nAmazing pork sandwiches that Alysha demanded to return to on our last day in London. The line here can be nuts. Get the Honey Truffle Parmesan, which is made with slow roasted pork shoulder, honey-truffle mayo, slaw, and aged parmesan. YUM. DEFINITELY NOT GLUTEN FREE.\nHorn OK Please\n:\nVegetarian Indian street food, including dosas and amazing chai. Matt ate here three times, and would do it again in a heartbeat. Gluten free and vegan options.\nTacos Padre\n:\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had some pretty mediocre tacos around the world, but I would put Tacos Padre somewhere near the top of the list of the best tacos I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever had outside of California and Mexico. The lamb barbacoa and the cochinita (a pork slow cooked with achiote) were outstanding.\nAlysha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s massive sandwich at the Black Pig\nAfter lunch, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one more stop that we highly recommend at Borough Market \u00e2\u0080\u0093\nthe Cider House\n.\nThey have a great selection of hard ciders, both on tap and in bottles, to try.\nMost are from English cider producers, but we also found offerings here from New Zealand, France, and South Africa. The friendly staff will help you figure out what kind of cider to try based on your tastes.\nA Walk Along the South Bank of the Thames\nWhen I touch down in London, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m generally jetlagged and tired from a long flight from the west coast of the US.\nTo combat that jetlag and stretch my legs, I head out to the southern bank of the Thames and walk from Tower Bridge to Westminster Bridge (home of Big Ben), past places like Borough Market (worth a stop for food!), the Tate Modern, and Millenium Bridge.\nThis stretch \u00e2\u0080\u0093 about three miles or so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is my absolute favorite part of London for an early morning (or evening) walk, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s packed with things to do, see, eat, and drink.\nFrom Borough Market, make your way all the way down the river to Westminster Bridge, which should take you the better part of a few hours, including stops for a museum, a drink, a bookshop, a snack, and whatever else piques your interest along the way.\nHere are the main stops along this stretch of river.\nShakespeare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Globe Theatre:\nFor over 500 years, England has been a powerhouse in the world of theater, thanks in no small part to William Shakespeare. A visit to The Globe, a stunning recreation built close to the original Elizabethan theater, gives you the chance to travel back in time and experience a performance. Even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not a fan of theater, The Globe is absolutely worth a visit. The circular outdoor venue hosts productions between April and September, with some of the UK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most talented actors performing modern (and traditional) interpretations of Shakespeare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s works.If you do want to catch a show, check the schedule\nhere\nand find a place to fit it in on your itinerary.\nThe Tate Modern:\nLocated at the former Bankside Power Station, the\nTate Modern\nis well worth a visit as you wander along the waterfront. The Tate Modern is England\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national gallery dedicated exclusively to modern art. The permanent collections are completely free of charge to view, and include an impressive selection of art from the likes of Picasso, Rothko and Monet. On the 10th floor of the Tate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blavatnik Building is an open terrace with fantastic views across the city to St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Canary Wharf.\nMillennium Bridge:\nJust outside the Tate, this bridge is in this guide for one reason \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the excellent view across the river to St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cathedral. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the best views in London, and is worth a slight detour to catch it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhere\non Google Maps.\nHere are a few other stops along the river bank.\nFoyles Bookshop\n:\nThis is one of the best bookstores in London, and they have a location on the ground floor of Southbank Centre, right before you get to Jubilee Bridge (if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re heading southwest).\nSouthbank Centre Food Market:\nThis was a happy accident. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Friday-Sunday only, so skip it if this day happens to be a weekday. We walked by it on a walk down the river and discovered\nPabellon\n, our favorite arepa place in London. Arepas are basically a sandwich made between two corn patties that comes from Venezuela. Seriously, go here. It was so good we went back three times. There are plenty of other food stalls here, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a nice outdoor courtyard with food and shopping called \u00e2\u0080\u009cGabriel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wharf\u00e2\u0080\u009d a little ways back (\nhere\non Google Maps) that is worth poking your head into.\nThe London Eye\n:\nThe London Eye is a little overrated, if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being honest. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done it before, but opted out on our latest trip. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little expensive, the lines are long, and the view from the Tate Modern viewing platform \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is free \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is a little better. If you have kids, this is a fun experience. If not, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably skip it and spend time elsewhere.\nOnce you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at London Eye, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re essentially at Westminster Bridge. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already seen that if you followed the first day!\nDinner and Drinks at Mercato Metropolitano\nTo close out your day, head south of the river to another of our favorite discoveries in London,\nMercato Metropolitano\n.\nThis place is fantastic, and is essentially a big food hall with indoor and outdoor seating (in an atmospheric garden) and a huge variety of different food stalls\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 all attached to a beer garden!\nFrom Sicilian arancini and granita (two of our favorite discoveries on our\nSicily road trip\n) to Venezuelan arepas, there are options for basically everyone here, which makes it a good choice for groups.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very, very popular spot \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it was packed full to the brim on a Thursday night when we were there \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and there are a bunch of different options to grab a drink.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend getting there a little early to snag a table, and hanging out and soaking up the atmosphere until you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready for dinner.\nDay 4: A Foray into North London (Camden and Notting Hill)\nOn your last day, venture out of Central London and head north (it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really only 20 minutes or so, nothing too crazy) out to Notting Hill.\nFrom there, make your way along the Regent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canal to Little Venice, and finally stroll into Camden, with a stop for the view at Primrose Hill on the way.\nNotting Hill and Portobello Road\nStart your morning in Notting Hill at\nNotting Hill Gate station\n, which is serviced by the Central District, and Circle Tube lines.\nFrom there, embark on a self-guided walking tour of one of London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most charming neighborhoods, made famous by the movie of the same name.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll essentially follow Portobello Road all the way through the neighborhood from south to north, which will take you to both highlights here \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Portobello Road Market, and the colorful houses at the other end of the neighborhood.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a map of the walk\n.\nThe\nPortobello Road Market\nis best on Saturdays, when the streets are packed with vendors.\nBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth a stroll on other days of the week too, particularly Fridays. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part food market, part antique market, and part everything else market.\nAt the northern end, leave Portobello Road and head to the two most photogenic parts of the neighborhood, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find those colorful homes that have made this area Instagram famous in recent years.\nBoth areas are literally a block away from each other \u00e2\u0080\u0093\nSaint Lukes Mews\nis a colorful back alley, and\nLancaster Road\nis where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find the multi-colored houses (which remind us of the famous Victorians in San Francisco, where we met, lived for a decade, and got married!).\nA Walk Along Regent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canal\nThis next section is optional, and is best for people who are up for a nice walk. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sometimes scenic, sometimes a little boring.\nIf that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound like something you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in, take the Tube to Camden and skip this section.\nWe actually walked all the way from Notting Hill to Camden along Regent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canal, which took a couple of hours and led us through Little Venice, which is easily the most picturesque piece of the walk.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a map of the route\n.\nNear the end, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be walking across the canal from the London Zoo in Regents Park, and you can see the giraffes, warthogs, and African wild dogs from the path.\nCamden Market (and Camden Town)\nCamden is a fascinating area, and we spent a third of one of our recent trips staying here to soak it all up.\nPunk music was essentially born in this part of London, and that part of the neighborhood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character is still very much front and center, with a variety of eclectic shops blasting heavy metal music lining Camden High Street.\nHowever, the highlight here is London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most-visited food market,\nCamden Market\n.\nSituated right on Regent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Canal, Camden Market is a sprawling complex of shops, food stalls, and more permanent restaurants.\nThere are several sections of the market, but the best part is on the north side of the Canal (\nhere\non Google Maps).\nThe market is overwhelming, with all sorts of smells and sounds attacking your senses, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well worth wandering a bit to take in everything it has to offer, from Indonesian curries to heavy metal-inspired t-shirts.\nIt feels like it just keeps going and going, and the scale of the market is pretty staggering.\nHere are a few of our highlights that, unsurprisingly, heavily focus on food.\nEl Pollote\n: Excellent (and gluten free!) guava-glazed chicken wings and sandwiches (the latter is not gluten free).\nMakatcha\n: Honestly, both the beef rendang and chicken coconut curry that I had at this Indonesian stand (on different days \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they also have a stand at Broadway Market) probably make the top 10 bites of food I had in London.\nArepazo / Arepa Venezuelan Kitchen:\nTo be honest, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the name of\nthis stand\nis. But I do know that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the place to get arepas at Camden Market. The pabell\u00c3\u00b3n, a pulled beef, was some of the best we had in London, and the vibes at the stand with the blasting music and dancing chef were awesome.\nKolkati\n:\nNot gluten free, but Alysha saw them at Broadway Market (another market worth visiting) and decided she had to have it. So she finally got it here at Camden Market. They make kati rolls, which are a street food staple of Kolkata that consists of fillings (either meat and accouterments or paneer) wrapped in bread.\nPrimrose Hill\nA short walk away from Camden Market along Regent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Park Road (to the west), you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find two of the once commonplace bright red British phone boxes, and after a classic photo opportunity, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reached the entrance to Primrose Hill park.\nPrimrose Hill is a wonderful place to spend a sunny couple of hours.\nYou won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find many tourists in this part of London, just lots of locals lounging in the sun or taking in the amazing vistas from this perfect vantage point, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to see nearly every famous building in the city.\nAfter Primrose Hill, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be well into the afternoon of your last day in London.\nFor the evening, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend grabbing dinner and drinks in a place that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already visited, but wanted to spend more time.\nCatch a Show!\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also recommend using this evening to catch a show, either at the Globe Theatre if you want a unique experience, or somewhere in the West End if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to see one of the more famous contemporary shows.\nOn my last trip to London, aside from doing a day trip, another big thing I wanted to make sure to do was catch a show.\nWe actually ended up catching two shows \u00e2\u0080\u0093\nHamilton\n(which was significantly cheaper than the touring version at home) and\nOperation Mincemeat\n, a comedy musical about an operation in World War 2 featuring a five person case playing a BUNCh of different roles (it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very fun).\nAt home, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen\nHamilton\n, Wicked, Moulin Rough (my favorite of the bunch),\nBook of Mormon\n, and\nLion King\n, and\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\n, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend all of them (although Book of Mormon probably isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for kids or people who are easily offended \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sorry mom).\nCheck out what shows are happening in London while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in town\nhere\n.\nWhat to Do with More Time in London\nHere are a few things to add to your itinerary if you happen to have more than four days.\nTake a Day Trip!\nOne of the best parts about the UK being a relatively small country in terms of area is that there are a pretty wide variety of great day trips that are accessible from London.\nAs I already mentioned above, we had big plans on our two week trip a few years ago to get out of the city and see some other parts of the country\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and we ended up spending the entire two weeks in London.\nOn this latest trip, I made it a high priority to get out of the city, and we ended up with a shortlist of three potential day trips:\nOxford, Cambridge, and Bath\n.\nOn our first few days, I asked everyone I could find (tour guides, baristas, bartenders, etc etc) which of the three they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend for our particular interests.\nWe immediately struck Cambridge from the list because the first three people I talked to said some version of \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically a worse Oxford\u00e2\u0080\u009d (from a tourist perspective \u00e2\u0080\u0093 their words, not mine).\nThe choice between Oxford and Bath largely comes down to your particular interests.\nBath is further, and has some really nice architecture, particularly Georgian architecture (multiple people said fans of Jane Austen love Bath).\nAnd, of course, there are the Roman baths that the city is named after.\nWe ultimately chose Oxford, which is about an hour away on the train and is a beautiful small town with tons of stone architecture and a rich history and culture as one of the oldest universities in Europe.\nThe library inside Christ Church (a major Harry Potter filming location)\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also big Lord of the Rings nerds, and J.R.R. Tolkein was at Oxford as a professor as he wrote\nThe Hobbit\nand the\nLord of the Rings\ntrilogy.\nAnother point in Oxford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favor. And we love Harry Potter, and parts of the movies were filmed in Oxford.\nIf you do go to Oxford, I highly recommend a guided tour of the campus (we did\nthis one\n, which is led by Oxford alumni AND includes Christ Church, where parts of Harry Potter were filmed), which will give you A LOT more insight into the specific history and culture behind what is one of the most famous universities in the world.\nCatch a Soccer (Football?) Game\nIn addition to high fantasy, another thing that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m passionate about is soccer. Or football, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called in the rest of the English-speaking world.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m quite literally sitting here at home writing this section with a Premier League game on in the background.\nThe big reason for this latest trip was to catch a few Premier League games with my brother, who is a West Ham fan (COYI).\nI support Brentford, so we did our best to see both (and succeeded).\nThe first thing you need to know is that Premier League tickets are heavily regulated, and the secondary market is somewhere between nonexistent and illegal (depending on who you talk to) in an effort to preserve prices for season ticket holders.\nWhich means tickets are harder to get than you might be used to if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming from an American context.\nOn the bright side, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find that tickets are SIGNIFICANTLY more affordable than they are in the US. On the not-so-bright side, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely more complicated to get them, especially for big Premier League games.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the gist of it: Tickets are released in waves, first to season ticket holders, then to members, then to previous purchasers, then to the general public (or some variation of this).\nTo get tickets to a game, you have a few options.\nBecome a member of the club (by paying their membership fee \u00e2\u0080\u0093 usually around \u00c2\u00a350) you want tickets for ahead of time, and then wait for tickets to be released to members.\nWait until tickets go on sale to the general public and hope that there are still some available.\nPurchase a \u00e2\u0080\u009chospitality package\u00e2\u0080\u009d that includes some extras and comes at a higher price and skips all of the minutiae above (\nP1 Travel\nwas the recommended company).\nGenerally speaking, it is easier to get tickets to lower league games (teams in the Championship of League One, two lower tiers of English soccer) than it is for Premier League games.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been to Craven Cottage, home of Fulham (and a few good American players over the years, like Clint Dempsey and Antonee Robinson) twice now, and love the intimate nature of the stadium (the front row of seats are basically on the pitch) and the location on the river.\nWe also went to the London Stadium to see West Ham, which was far less charming and interesting (though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s huge).\nOther clubs to look at other than the big ones (Tottenham, Chelsea, and Arsenal) would be Crystal Palace, Leyton Orient, and Brentford.\nWhat to Do with Less Time in London\nWe had almost two full weeks in London, but we realize most people aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blessed with that much time to explore. Or even able to spend four days.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d spend less time in London, from one to three days. You can use these overviews to get an idea of the plan, and then use the detailed sections in the itinerary above to go deeper on the places you end up including.\nLondon in a Day\nWith just a day in London, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really going to have to pick and choose what you do and see, because a day is not nearly enough time.\nBut, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here to give you our best take on how to spend your time, so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about what a perfect day in London looks like, at least for us.\nImmediately, we think you should skip the museums. The\nNatural History Museum\nand\nVictoria and Albert Museum\nare both cool, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty far away from the rest of Central London.\nThe other thing you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to miss is the\nChanging of the Guard\n.\nFirst of all, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen every single day year-round, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a chance that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even happening on the day you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in London.\nSecond, having that specific time in mind makes it hard to plan the rest of the day.\nInstead, focus on exploring the area around the Thames. Start your day at\nBuckingham Palace\n, the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part time residence (we were told by multiple people that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hardly ever there these days). Make your way to\nWestminster Abbey\nfrom there, and admire\nBig Ben\nbefore walking over the\nWestminster Bridge\n.\nFrom there, make your way along the south bank of the Thames, following the walk in the main itinerary above.\nStop at\nBorough Market\nfor lunch, then make your way across either\nLondon Bridge\n(better views, specifically of Tower Bridge and the Tower of London), or\nTower Bridge\n(worse views, but a cool experience) and head to the\nTower of London\n.\nFinally, make your way on a walk through the city of London, and end at\nSt. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cathedral.\nWith 2 Days\nWith 2 days in London, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to do some swapping around of activities, but you can use the first three days of the itinerary above as a baseline.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do it.\nOn the first day, combine the\nmorning of day 1\n(St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, the London Museum, and the City of London) and the\nmorning of day 2\n(Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, and Buckingham Palace).\nStart with the Westminster stuff to make sure to get to the Abbey early, and end with St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Head to\nShoreditch\nfor dinner and drinks.\nOn the second day,\nfollow day 3 as written\nabove. If you want to catch a show while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in town do it on your second evening.\nWith 3 Days\nWith three days, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d follow the itinerary above as written, and skip day 4 altogether.\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bummer to miss out on Camden Market, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making it to Borough Market, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a taste of London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food markets.\nIf you want to catch a show, you can add it to any of the evenings pretty easily.\nMatt Hansen\nMatt is the founder and main writer behind Wheatless Wanderlust, which he started back in 2018 as a way to share his gluten free travel guides with his fellow Celiac travelers.\nSince then, Matt and his wife Alysha have visited all of the national parks in the western USA, spent three months in Europe, and have explored every corner of the Pacific Northwest, which is where Matt grew up.\nHe has now settled down in Portland, Oregon, and makes several international trips a year to continue exploring (read: eating all of the gluten free foods).\nHe writes super detailed guides to the places they visit, bringing together personal experience and historical context to help YOU plan an amazing trip.\nLeave a Reply\nCancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nComment\n*\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\n\u0394\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.\nLearn how your comment data is processed.\nSearch\nToggle Menu Close\nSearch for:\nSearch"}]}

You want to start your day here fairly early because as time goes on it will get considerably busier.\nBy considerably busier I mean basically hell on earth for anyone that hates crowds like me.\nSo get there nice and sharp in the morning and you\u2019ll be able to do some high street shopping without having to queue hours for a changing room.\nRed buses in Oxford Street, London\nPiccadilly Circus\nFrom Oxford Street you can walk to Oxford Circus, down Regent Street and to the popular Piccadilly Circus. This is London\u2019s equivalent of Times Square in New York.\nWith the big bright advertising billboards, multiple road crossings, street buskers and crowds it\u2019s quite the sight.\nAn alternative road you can take is the colourful Carnaby Street, it\u2019s just parallel to Regent Street and while it\u2019s always busy, it\u2019s completely pedestrian so it\u2019s a bit more pleasant to walk along.\nExploring Regent Street in London, UK\nLeicester Square\nFrom Piccadilly Circus it\u2019s a very short walk over to Leicester Square. Leicester Square is that place you always see on TV when they do movie premieres in London.\nThere are a number of very cool cinemas here but if you\u2019re only in London for 2 days, you probably don\u2019t want to spend a couple hours of your time locked up in a dark room.\nThere are loads of quick takeaway food places in Leicester Square but they will most likely be over priced and not that great.\nCovent Garden\nCovent Garden is a short 5-minute walk away from Leicester Square and one of the most famous spots in London.\nThe central covered area of Covent Garden, known as the Apple Market, is full of cool shops, bars and restaurants, and also a few touristy but quirky market stalls.\nThe Apple Market in Covent Garden at Christmas\nTrafalgar Square\nAfter Covent Garden you can walk down to Trafalgar Square where you can visit the National Gallery. Entry to museums in London is generally always free, you only pay for the exhibitions that are on at that specific time.\nIf like me you\u2019re not a museum person (I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve only been inside the National Gallery once) Trafalgar Square is still a nice and famous spot of London that you can admire, and from there walk on to your next stop.\nWestminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament & Big Ben\nFrom Trafalgar Square it\u2019s a short walk down to the river, where you will see two of the most iconic London sights.\nBig Ben is under restructuring works at the moment, but you can still visit Westminster Abby and the Houses of Parliament.\nClick here to purchase your entrance to Westminster Abbey!\nThe iconic red phone box, red bus and Big Ben in the background (even if he\u2019s under construction)\nThe Houses of Parliament and Big Ben under reconstruction works\nLondon Eye\nJust across the river you will see the London Eye, it\u2019s hard to miss. In 9 years of living in London I have only been up the London Eye once, but I can say it\u2019s really something.\nYes it\u2019s super touristy, but the view is incredible. You get amazing 360 views over the Thames River, Houses of Parliament and Big Ben on one side, and St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Tower Bridge and the Shard on the other.\nIt\u2019s one of the most famous attractions in London, so the queue can get huge. I 100% recommend\npurchasing tickets online beforehand\n, so that you can skip the queue.\nAfter all, if you only have two days in London, you don\u2019t want to waste them queuing around!\nClick here to purchase your London Eye Fast Track ticket!\nView over Westminster from the London Eye\nBorough Market\nAfter seeing the London Eye I suggest walking all along the river to Borough Market.\nYou could also take the tube from Waterloo to London Bridge, which would save you some time, but the walk along South Bank is one of the most beautiful spots in London in my opinion.\nEspecially if you\u2019re visiting London in summer or on a sunny day, walking along the Thames and seeing the skyline of London is pretty epic.\nYou will see some main landmarks along this walk including the Tate Modern, Shakespeare\u2019s Globe and Millennium Bridge.\nMillennium Bridge in London, with St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in the background\nBorough Market is a great place to try some of London\u2019s famous street food. There are tons of different stalls that sell food from all over the world.\nIt\u2019s the perfect place to stop for a quick lunch on the go without wasting hours sitting down at a restaurant and waiting to be served.\nOne of the fresh fruit and vegetables stalls at Borough Market, London\nThe Shard\nJust next to Borough Market is the Shard, a skyscraper with 95 floors and one of the best views over London.\nThere is a viewing platform on the 70\nth\nfloor, the tickets cost between 24 GBP and 32 GBP depending on how far in advance you book them.\nHowever, there are a couple bars in the Shard just a couple floors below that you can access for free.\nCocktails are around 15 \u2013 20 GBP which is expensive, but considering you\u2019re at the highest bar in London, it could be much worst.\nI\u2019d recommend going to the bar instead of the viewing platform since you end up paying a similar price, but at least you get a drink while you enjoy the view.\nIf a cocktail doesn\u2019t fit your travel plans, book your ticket to The Shard\u00a0viewing deck here!\nThe view over London from the Shard\nTower Bridge\nFrom the Shard it\u2019s a short walk across More London Place to reach Tower Bridge.\nIf you\u2019re visiting in summer they usually have a Mexican food truck down next to the river with sun bed chairs, and they often have shows on in The Scoop (the round theatre-like area along the river).\nFrom along the river you can walk right up to Tower Bridge and then you\u2019ll see a set of stairs that you have to walk up to cross the river.\nPrime sunset spot over Tower Bridge and the Thames\nTower of London\nThis is where I admit that I haven\u2019t actually visited the Tower of London yet.\nI\u2019ve walked past the Tower of London numerous times, been on river cruises that set off from Tower Pier (a lot of university student clubs do that), even been ice skating at the Tower of London, but I\u2019ve never been inside.\nIf you want to see the Crown Jewels and learn more about the Tower of London you will have to go inside, however if you\u2019re happy with just seeing it walking around it is enough.\nClick here to book a visit to the Tower of London & Crown Jewels Exhibition!\nTower Bridge and the Tower of London at golden hour\nSky Garden\nYou\u2019re probably thinking these are quite a lot of things to do in one day so don\u2019t worry, we have arrived at the last stop of this London itinerary.\nFrom Tower of London it\u2019s less than a 10-minute walk to Sky Garden. Similarly to the Shard Sky Garden also has epic views over London, just from the opposite side of the river.\nAccess is always free but if you visit during the day you have to book a ticket beforehand with specific time slot, after 6PM you can visit on a free walk-in basis but there is a fairly strict smart casual dress code.\nDrinks are fairly pricey at the bars in Sky Garden but once again, considering the venue it could be much worst.\nI recommend trying to get here for sunset since watching the sun go down over London, turning everything golden, and then the skyline slowly lighting up is pretty magical.\nView over the roofs of London from Sky Garden\nI\u2019ve embedded below a map of this walking itinerary, or you can click\nhere\nto open it in Google Maps. As you can see this big long list of things to do only adds up to about two hours of walking time.\nObviously it depends on how long you decide to spend in every location.\nWhether you want to go on a crazy shopping spree on Oxford Street or spend hours inside the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, but roughly speaking the above itinerary can be done in one day and would make for a perfect start to your 2 days in London.\nLondon 2 day itinerary: Day 2\nI hope you\u2019re not knackered by yesterday\u2019s activities, because you have another full day of excitement awaits!\nPortobello Market\nFor your second day in London we\u2019re moving away a bit from the hustle and bustle of central London and starting our day in Portobello.\nPortobello is a lovely area of London with cute colourful houses and a popular market.\u00a0\u00a0The market and shops in Portobello sell all sorts of cool vintage things but also the standard street food and touristy souvenirs.\nThe coloured houses of Portobello Road, London\nNotting Hill\nPortobello is just around the corner from the beautiful white houses of Notting Hill.\nThere isn\u2019t one specific spot that you must see; it\u2019s just a beautiful area of London that you can walk around for a bit and admire the Victorian architecture of these\nbeautiful London streets\n.\nIf you want, you can also join a\nguided walking tour of Notting Hill\n. It\u2019s a great way to make sure you see all the prettiest spots, with a local guide teaching you about the history of the area.\nClick here to book your Notting\u00a0Hill walking tour!\nThe beautiful white houses of Notting Hill, London\nHyde Park\nAfter Notting Hill you will arrive at Hyde Park, London\u2019s most famous and biggest park (in central London anyway). If you\u2019re visiting in summer or on a sunny day you will find crowds of Londoners basking in the sun.\nEven in winter it\u2019s a very peaceful area and you can enjoy the beauty of it walking around Kensington Palace and the Serpentine.\nClick here to book your visit to Kensington Palace in Hyde Park\nSouth Kensington & the museums\nJust make sure that you\u2019re crossing the park in the right direction so that when you pop out on the other side you\u2019re right next to South Kensington and all the museums.\nWalk past the Royal Albert Hall (a pretty stunning building in itself) and you\u2019ll reach the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum.\nThey\u2019re all very different in style and seeing all the exhibitions inside all of the museums would take days.\nThe Royal Albert Hall, London\nUnfortunately you only have 2 days in London but its still worth popping inside one or two of the museums depending on your interests. I\u2019m a personal fan of the Natural History Museum and their dinosaur display.\nEntry to the permanent exhibitions is free anyway you can just go in and wander around for a bit without feeling like you have to see everything in one go since you paid a ticket for it (or is that just me?)\nIf you\u2019re visiting\nLondon at Christmas\nthey always put up a beautiful ice rink at the Natural History Museum where you can try ice-skating.\nThe Natural History Museum in London from outside\nHarrods\nOnce you\u2019re done exploring the museums it\u2019s time to walk on to the famous Harrods.\nHarrods is a huge department store founded in 1824 where they sell all sorts of things. One thing to note is that Harrods is very expensive.\nWhile I wouldn\u2019t recommend buying anything there I still think it\u2019s a pretty cool place to see and wander around for a bit, especially if it\u2019s your first time in London and you only have two days.\nBuckingham Palace\nFrom Harrods you can walk through Green Park and arrive at Buckingham Palace in less than 20 minutes. Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the royal family.\nIf you time your visit right you might also be able to see the change of the guard outside the Buckingham Palace gates.\nYou can also\nvisit the State Rooms of Buckingham Palace\n. If you\u2019re interested in history and the Royal Family, it\u2019s a very fun and interesting visit!\nBook your visit to Buckingham Palace here!\nMy first and last trip to Buckingham Palace in 7 years of living in London\nThat\u2019s all the walking I\u2019ve got in store for you today, wasn\u2019t that bad was it? I\u2019ve included the map with walking itinerary below or click here to see it on Google Maps.\nIt\u2019s around 1.5 hours of walking but depending on how long you want to spend inside the museums or shopping inside Harrods, it can take up the whole day.\nCool things to do in London not included in this London 2 day itinerary\nAs I previously mentioned the British capital is pretty huge and seeing all of London in two days isn\u2019t very realistic.\nThere are some areas of London that I personally love but haven\u2019t included in my London 2-day itinerary since they\u2019re not considered the main tourist attractions and landmarks.\nHowever, if for example you want to see some markets and aren\u2019t interested in museums you can skip South Kensington and visit the quirky Shoreditch or Camden instead.\nMost of these areas are very popular in evenings so you can always visit them after the itineraries I wrote above.\nShoreditch\nShoreditch is the hipster and artsy area of London. There are tons of cool bars, restaurants, pubs, clubs and shops all over the neighbourhood.\nIt\u2019s a cool area to wander around during the day to explore the vintage and design shops and colourful graffiti, but it\u2019s especially popular in evenings. The nightlife in Shoreditch never disappoints.\nA very Shoreditch donut shop with colourful graffiti facade\nCamden Town & Market\nCamden was the hipster and edgy area of London before Shoreditch become popular.\nThere\u2019s a big market with lots of street food, clothes, jewellery, vintage things, home decor, souvenirs and pretty much anything you can think of being sold there.\nIt used to be the rebel punk area (to give you a better idea, Amy Winehouse used to live in Camden) and even today there are still tons of tattoo and piercing parlours.\nIt\u2019s become a bit more touristy and less edgy in recent years but is still a cool area to walk around.\nThe market is closed in evenings but there are loads of bars, pubs and clubs and there is a lively nightlife so you can always visit Camden in evenings.\nCamden Market in London, UK\nChinatown\nChinatown in London is actually just next to Leicester Square, but I chose not to include it in my London 2-day itinerary as it takes time to explore it properly and it wouldn\u2019t have fit in the day 1 schedule.\nAlso the best part of Chinatown is the food so I recommend going around dinnertime to try one of the many Chinese restaurants.\nExploring Chinatown in London\nSoho\nSoho is another neighbourhood very close to Chinatown and Leicester Square that I chose not to cover in your day 1 itinerary.\nIt\u2019s a vibrant and very cool area to explore but you can do so in the evening, discovering all the cool dining and nightlife options.\nAfternoon tea bus tour\nAfternoon tea is a very British tradition consisting of savoury sandwiches, cakes, scones and obviously, lots of tea.\nThere are loads of places that do very good afternoon teas in London but inevitably will take up a large chunk of your day (if you\u2019re a fast eater like me, you might not love afternoon tea, it\u2019s one of those things you\u2019re supposed to take slow and enjoy the experience\u2026)\nIf you only have two days in London a good solution is doing an\nafternoon tea bus tour\n. This allows you to enjoy the experience while also touring around London and seeing all the main tourist highlights.\nClick here to book your spot on a B Bakery afternoon tea bus tour!\nGetting ready for our afternoon tea bus tour in London\nOur afternoon tea selection on the B Bakery bus tour\nBritish Museum\nThe British Museum didn\u2019t feature on my essential London 2-day itinerary since it\u2019s not quite along the walking routes I\u2019d planned out.\nHowever it\u2019s not too far don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s in central London less than a 10-minute walk away from Oxford Street. Entry is free and there are loads of cool things you can see like Rosetta\u2019s stone and more.\nGo for a showboat dinner cruise\nIf you want to spend a bit of a different evening enjoying good food and touring around London, you should definitely do a\ndinner showboat cruise\n.\nAs you might have guessed from the name, this is a cruise along the Thames where you will be served dinner as live music and singing takes place.\nWe enjoyed a lovely 4-course dinner while admiring the view over main sights of London, such as the London Eye, St Paul\u2019s, Tower Bridge and Greenwich.\nIt combines good food with sightseeing and live music, the perfect evening out in London!\nClick here to book your showboat dinner cruise!\nEnjoying my 4-course meal during the showboat dinner cruise\nSee a musical!\nThe West End of London is famous for its theatres and musicals. If you have the time I would highly recommend trying to squeeze in watching a show in your London 2-day itinerary.\nOver the past 7 years I\u2019ve been to see The Lion King, Aladdin, Wicked, Billy Elliot and The Phantom of the Opera and they were all pretty amazing. There are tons of shows I still haven\u2019t seen myself!\nRegents Park\nRegents Park is smaller than Hyde Park and a bit more of a local hangout spot. On one of the park you will find Primrose Hill, where all the Londoners go hang out and have picnics on sunny summer days.\nView over Regents Park and the London skyline from Primrose Hill\nSt Pauls Cathedral\nSt Pauls Cathedral should have probably featured much higher on my list of things to see in London in two days, however I chose not to include it before since you will be seeing plenty of it even without actually visiting it.\nAs you walk along the river and from all the viewpoints you will be able to see the dome of St Pauls towering over the roofs of London.\nIf you have time you can go see the inside of the cathedral but if not, no harm done (in 7 years I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been inside myself)\nClick here to book a fast track ticket to St\u00a0Paul\u2019s\u00a0Cathedral\nSt Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London, UK\nDo a Harry Potter walking tour\nIf you\u2019re a Harry Potter fan, you have to do this. I didn\u2019t list it in my main 2-day London itinerary because I realise not everyone is as Harry Potter obsessed as I am, but it\u2019s definitely worth doing.\nIt will allow you to not only see all the\nHarry Potter filming locations in London\n, but you\u2019ll also learn some fun facts about the movies. It will go past some of the main London landmarks, so you will still see a lot of London.\nIf you follow my guide, you can easily visit all the filming spots alone, but I personally think it\u2019s more fun to do a\nguided tour\n. Sharing the experience with other Potter-heads will make it all the more fun!\nClick here to book your Harry Potter walking tour!\nPlatform 9 and 3/4 in London King\u2019s Cross station\nVisit the Harry Potter Warner Bros Studios\nThis is another activity that is definitely worth mentioning, but given not everyone is a Harry Potter fan, I didn\u2019t want to include it in my main London 2-day itinerary.\nWhether you\u2019re a family with children, or a group of millennials who grew up reading the books and watching the Harry Potter movies, the Harry Potter studio tour is great fun.\nEven though it spoils the magic a little bit, seeing how the movies are made is really interesting. Plus you can stock up on butter beer, chocolate frogs and fun Harry Potter gadgets!\nIt\u2019s outside London and planning your transfer there can be a bit complicated, which is why I recommend\nbooking this tour\n, since it includes both entrance to the studios and transfer there.\nClick here to purchase your Harry Potter Warner Bros Tour with Transfer from London!\nMe in 2015 visiting the Harry Potter Warner Bros Studios\nLogistical tips for your weekend in London\nWhat to pack for two days in London\nNot that there is a shortage of shops in London where you can buy things if you were to forget anything, however there are a couple essentials things that you might want to bring with you for your two days in London.\nUmbrella\n:\nYes, laugh as much as you want, but the stereotypes of the British capital are unfortunately largely true. It rains a lot here.\nYou don\u2019t want to be caught out in the rain so it\u2019s just easier to always carry one of those tiny foldable umbrellas with you.\nPower bank\n:\nAfter all if you\u2019re going to be walking around all day, you won\u2019t have time to sit down and charge your phone!\nAlso you will need your phone to check Google Maps and that you\u2019re headed in the right direction, or what time things close.\nComfortable walking shoes\n:\nMy London 2-day itinerary has a lot of walking involved, so you wan to make sure you to do so in comfortable trainers to avoid having painful feet at the end of the day.\nSt Pancras Renaissance Hotel in London, UK\nWhere to stay in London\nDespite living in London over the years I\u2019ve stayed in a number of hotels throughout London, whether with family when they came to visit (and couldn\u2019t fit in my tiny student halls room) or more recently with blog collaborations and I can recommend some hotels in London for every budget.\nHowever more than a specific hotel I can suggest\nareas of London where you can stay\n.\nIf you only have two days in London you will want to stay very central or you will waste time travelling around, if you go a bit further out make sure to be within 5 minutes walking distance to a tube station.\nPersonally I would recommend staying either in Camden, Angel or even more central around Holborn and Bank.\nClick here to see the latest prices and\u00a0availability for\u00a0accommodation in London!\nLeadenhall Market in London, UK\nBudget accommodation\nThere are tons of hostels in London. I\u2019ve never personally stayed in one but have heard great things of\nWombats\n.\nThere are also loads of hotel chains with numerous properties around London like\nHoliday Inn\nor the Travelodge that are more affordable than independent hotels.\nThe more central ones are a bit more expensive but usually still offer good value for money.\nMid-range accommodation\nJust like there are budget chain hostels and hotels, there are also a number of mid-range chains you can go for like\nHilton\nor\nMarriott\nspread all over London.\nMy parents stayed at the\nHilton in Angel\nback when I used to live in the area and loved it, Angel is also a great area to stay as its a bit outside the tourist chaos of London but still within easy reach of all the main attractions.\nThese options are a bit fancier than the previous budget suggestions but at more reasonable prices than the luxury properties in London.\nLuxury accommodation\nI spent one night at the\nSt Pancras Renaissance Hotel\nfor a blog collaboration and that was the fanciest place I have slept at in London.\nThe property is beautiful, the service excellent and the location perfect as base to explore London, especially if you only have 2 days in London.\nI also spent an afternoon at\nCheval Three Quays\nwhere a friend of mine was staying and can highly recommend it, the apartments are new, have a great view of the Thames and are in a great location to explore London.\nThe Grand Staircase of the St Pancras Renaissance Hotel in London, UK\nWhere to eat in London\nWhen I first moved to London from Italy everybody told me how the food in London was shit. Having lived here for 7 years now I can strongly disagree with that.\nFor Italian standards sure there is a lot of junk food out there (I\u2019m looking at you Pizza Hut and your pizzas with burgers in the crust) but there are also a lot of amazing dining options for every budget.\nLondon is a very international city and that\u2019s reflected in the variety of cuisines you can find.\nSince you\u2019re only in London for two days I wouldn\u2019t waste too much time sitting in restaurants, but there are cool and cheap dining options on the go.\nStreet food\nThe\nstreet food in London\nis awesome.\nThere are famous street food markets like Borough Market and Camden Market but you will also find street food trucks here and there all over London, especially in the busy touristy spots.\nThe prices vary massively depending on the cuisine, how big a portion you get, where in London it is and lots of other factors, but I\u2019ve had meals from street food trucks in London for anywhere between 3 GBP and 10 GBP.\nThe halloumi fries at Camden Market, London\nEat on the go\nIf you don\u2019t want to eat street food but you also don\u2019t want to sit down at a restaurant there are tons of places you can eat on the go in London.\nAll the Pret A Manger, Eat, Wasabi, Itsu, LEON, Pod, Starbucks and other chains you see around serve food fresh and ready to go.\nThey usually have seats inside if you want to take a break from walking around London or you can grab a sandwich and keep going.\nIt obviously depends on how much food you get but you wouldn\u2019t generally spend more than 10 GBP for lunch at these places.\nThe scotch egg and sweet potato fries of Borough Market, London\nChain restaurants\nIf you want to sit down for a proper meal without spending a fortune, worry not, there are thousands of restaurants all over London, both independent and chains.\nAs a tourist it can be a bit hit and miss going to an independent boutique hotel, as you can\u2019t know if they\u2019re good or not.\nWhile they\u2019re less authentic, with chain restaurants you\u2019re always sure that a certain standard will be met. The ones of ethnic cuisines are also easier to eat at as the flavours are adapted for Western tastes.\nSome of my personal favourites are Wagamama, GBK, Wahaca, Franco Manca, Rosa\u2019s Thai, Nando\u2019s and Pho.\nStarters at Lima Floral, a Peruvian chain restaurant in London\nFancy or Michelin-starred restaurants\nIf you want to go fancy, London can do fancy very well. London has 70 Michelin starred restaurants (and there many more fancy and delicious restaurants that don\u2019t have Michelin stars) that you can try.\nI was a\nstudent in London\nso I can\u2019t say I have much experience with these, so you might want to check out this\nguide by Secret London\ninstead.\nEnjoying the sunset at the London Eye\nDo you need travel insurance for 2 days in London?\nAfter my personal experience spending two nights in a private hospital in Tenerife, and having to pay for it out of pocket (it wasn\u2019t cheap), I always recommend getting travel insurance.\nYou might not end up needing it, but for a small fee you can travel without worries. Personally, I suggest getting your travel insurance with\nHeymondo\n.\nHeymondo\noffers tailor made travel insurance, providing the best value for money for your specific trip. You can also buy it once you\u2019re already abroad and have forgotten about it before flying (which, if you\u2019re anything like me, is quite likely).\nBesides the usual cancellation, medical expenses, luggage coverage and general travel insurance services,\nHeymondo\nalso has a 24/7 doctor chat and instant assistance through their app.\nAs a Greta\u2019s Travels reader, you get 5% off your\nHeymondo travel insurance\n!\nClick here to get your 5% off Heymondo travel insurance!\nExploring Westminster in London\nHow to get into London\nFirst things first, how do you get into London?\nLondon has six major airports, and depending on where in the city you\u2019re staying, it can be quite the journey getting to your accommodation from the airport.\nIf you\u2019re flying internationally from a long-haul destination you would usually arrive at Heathrow, whilst if you\u2019re flying from a European destination with a low-cost airline you would usually arrive at Luton, Gatwick or Stansted.\nFrom all of these major London airports you can catch a train that will take you directly into Central London, usually at either Victoria Station, St Pancras Station or Liverpool Street depending on the airport.\nHowever if you\u2019re not a train person, you can also check out these coach transfers:\nBus Transfer from Gatwick Airport\nBus Transfer from Stansted Airport\nBus Transfer from Luton Airport\nPRIVATE Transfer from Heathrow Airport\n\u2013 this is preferable if you\u2019re a family travelling with children and don\u2019t want to wait for trains or buses!\nIf you\u2019re a family or group, getting a private transfer won\u2019t be much more expensive than the train, and it will save you time. If you only have two days in London, you don\u2019t want to waste time getting into the city!\nGolden hour over the London Eye and Westminster in London, UK\nIf you want to save money I recommend getting the normal train service as opposed to the express airport ones.\nFor example Gatwick Airport has the Gatwick Express that takes you into Victoria station in half an hour for around 20 GBP.\nInstead if you get the normal Southern trains service this usually stops at London Bridge, City Thameslink, Farringdon and then St Pancras International and only costs around 10 GBP.\nI prefer this option because it saves me money and time, since even if the train is a bit slower it does more stops in central London where you can get off and be ready to see the city without having to take public transport from Victoria.\nSimilarly the Heathrow Express costs around 20 GBP and takes you to Paddington, which is pretty far from all the main attractions.\nIf you get the Piccadilly line you will pay around 6 GBP and it takes you straight into central London. To find the most convenient train I always check online on the\nTrainline\n.\n| READ MORE:\nTHE ULTIMATE LONDON BUCKET LIST\n|\nEnjoying the sunset over the rooftops of London and St Paul\u2019s Cathedral from Madisons Rooftop Bar\nHow to get around London\nOk so you\u2019ve arrived in London, how do you actually move around this huge city? You might think me crazy but the best way to get around London is actually walking!\nAll the main attractions in central London are fairly close to each other, and walking from one to the other actually allows you to see the beautiful architecture around and take in the London atmosphere.\nTransport for London actually put together a map with the walking times between tube stations in London (tube \u2013 that\u2019s what Londoners call the underground system here).\nAdmittedly some are pretty far but look at the centre of zone 1, some stops are only 3 minutes away from each other!\n| READ MORE:\nTHE MOST BEAUTIFUL & PHOTOGENIC PLACES IN LONDON\n|\nLondon tube map that shows the walking times between stations, image by TfL\nIf you don\u2019t want to walk London has a very efficient public transport system. Both the tube and buses run super regularly and cover pretty much every corner of central London.\nYou can get an Oyster travel card or if you have a contactless credit or debit card you can tap that to get on buses and in the tube.\nPer journey you pay 1.50 GBP for the bus or from 2.40 GBP upwards for the tube depending what zone you travel to.\nTfL put a daily cap in place at 7 GBP, which means after three tube journeys you\u2019re not paying anymore for additional trips.\nYou can also find black cabs and ubers everywhere in London but I personally only take them in evenings if I\u2019m going home late.\nGetting in a car in central London during the day basically means wasting your whole day given the traffic situation. Ubers are also generally cheaper than black cabs.\nSunset with a view over Tower Bridge and the Shard in London, UK\nFinal thoughts on my London in 2 days itinerary\nHave you been to London before?

I'm so excited to share with you the things we did and saw, and my top recommendations for this wonderful city.\nIn case you missed it, the reason we were in London was because Charlie had a work trip there. I was planning on holding down the fort alone, but Eleanor's passport came in way sooner than anticipated. When her passport came in, I thought to myself, would it be the craziest thing ever to fly to London with my four-month-old alone (Charlie's flight had a layover and I knew we wouldn't want that?)? And basically do a solo trip with her there? The answer is yes - it absolutely is and was crazy, and it was worth every single second of it!\nIf you haven't been to London, it is one of the world's largest and most vibrant cities with SO much to do. Due to needing to test negative for COVID to get back into the United States, we opted to do almost everything outdoors during our four days in London. Thankfully, London is known for its gorgeous architecture, markets and amazing parks so there was plenty to keep us busy! Even without COVID, I highly recommend making the time to check out all of the parks, markets, palaces and historical sites.\nGetting to London\nOne of the best parts of London is how EASY it is to get there! It has a huge international airport (Heathrow) which makes it an ideal spot for an international trip.\nOnce you arrive at Heathrow, you have a few options for how to get downtown. The first option is taking a taxi. This is going to be the most expensive option and depending on when you arrive, the traffic from Heathrow to downtown London is really not great. It can take up to two hours to get downtown! For that reason, I don't recommend taking a taxi to your hotel.\nThe fastest and most stress-free way to get from Heathrow to London is the dedicated airport train, the Heathrow Express. This takes just 15 minutes from Heathrow to Paddington Station running every 15 minutes. Once you get to Paddington Station, you can take a taxi, Uber, or walk to you hotel. This is what we did, and it was SO easy to figure out! You can buy a round-trip or one-way trip ticket\nhere\n. One thing to note is that if you book your Heathrow Express journey at least 90 days in advance, you could get a one-way ticket for just \u00a35.50!\nGetting Around London\nThere are lots of ways to get around during your four days in London. First, you should know London has an AMAZING public transportation system! This includes their bus system and train (\"the tube\"). I opted not to spend much time on the tube because not all of their train stations have elevators (or \"lifts\" as they call them). I would have a stroller with me from walking around with Eleanor, so that would be a challenge. If you plan on going alone, or want to wear your baby, then the tube is a great option. You can buy individual tickets for each ride, but many people visiting the city get an\nOyster Card\n. This allows you to travel on almost all of London's public transit options and can save you both time and money.\nPersonally, I was SHOCKED by how walkable London was and think the best way to get around is by foot! With the exception of the hop-on hop-off bus, and one taxi ride, we walked everywhere.\nAnother way to get around is by Uber or their Black Cabs! You can use the app\nFREE NOW\nto call a taxi - it's very similar to the Uber app. If you're traveling with a baby/kids, one thing that's nice about taking a taxi is you can simply put your entire stroller in the backseat (standing up and locked - it doesn't need to be folded or anything!). This just makes getting around SO much easier and more seamless.\nI definitely do NOT recommend driving yourself around London. There are congestion fees in downtown London, parking is insanely expensive, and traffic can be a nightmare. Save yourself the time and money!\nWhere We Stayed\nI LOVED where we stayed in London. Let me emphasize that London is a very expensive city. If it weren't for Charlie's employer paying for him to stay in this hotel, we probably would have worked harder to find a more budget-friendly hotel. That said, this hotel was amazingly centrally-located and extremely nice. We stayed at the\nLondon Hilton on Park Lane\nin Mayfair. It was located right next to Hyde Park, and across the street from Buckingham Palace.\nLondon Itinerary Day 1: Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Parliament Square\nWe took a redeye flight on Sunday night and arrived in London around 7AM local time. From the airport, we took the Heathrow Express to Paddington station. While it would have been easier to catch a cab with all of our luggage and stroller, we were SO excited to be in London and decided to walk to our hotel to drop our luggage off (check-in wasn't until 3PM). I've found that the best way to avoid jet-lag is to just force yourself to stay awake as long as possible until it's a reasonable time to go to bed. So, we avoided napping!\nStroll Through Hyde Park\nAs I mentioned above, London has so many gorgeous parks, and Hyde Park is one of them. I highly recommend walking through Hyde Park and people watching. Hyde Park is one of London's eight Royal Parks - it covers 350 acres, and offers so much greenery, flower gardens, walking and biking paths, and a playground. You'll also see people riding horses!\nVisit Buckingham Palace\nAfter walking through Hyde Park, we walked over to visit Buckingham Palace. As you probably know, Buckingham Palace is the most famous palace in the UK. It serves as the primary London residence for the reigning sovereign of the United Kingdom. If you want to see the Changing of the Guard, you can check out\nthis schedule\n. Regardless, I highly recommend at least walking past Buckingham Palace and taking it all in!\nWalk to Parliament Square (Big Ben and Westminster Abbey)\nFrom Buckingham Palace, we walked over to Parliament Square. This square is a really popular/busy one and is\u00a0surrounded by famous buildings. This includes Westminster Abbey, the United Kingdom Supreme Court, the UK Supreme Court, and the Houses of Parliament (which is where you'll see\nBig Ben!\n). It was so exciting getting to see so many famous London spots that were on our list within just a few minutes!\nWestminster Abbey\nis one of England's most famous churches, and the architecture is stunning (see picture below). If you plan to visit Westminster Abbey, make sure you leave extra time to get in and see everything as it is a popular place and it takes a while to explore. You can skip the ticket line by getting your ticket online in advance\nhere\n.\nSt. James's Park\nFrom Parliament Square, we started making our way back to the hotel in Mayfair because it was almost finally time to check in! We walked through St. James's Park to get back in the direction of the hotel. This is another one of London's eight Royal Parks, and I just can't get enough of all of London's gorgeous green space!\nWe made our way back to the hotel and picked up sandwiches at Pret on the way back. Charlie went off to a work meeting and dinner, and Eleanor and I passed out early because we were exhausted from the time difference. We also knew we had a full day of exploring ahead of us the next day!\nLondon Itinerary Day 2: Tower Bridge, Tower of London, Borough Market\nHop-On Hop-Off Bus\nOn my second day in London, Eleanor and I decided to use the hop-on hop-off bus with\nBig Bus Tours\nand it was amazing!! This was my first time doing a hop-on hop-off bus tour, and I couldn't recommend it more. It included headphones and an audio tour throughout the route. It was such an easy way to see so much of the city and learn about the different neighborhoods and location. I really got a feel for London by doing this!\nI knew I wanted to see the Tower of London this day. Because it was on the opposite side of town, taking a taxi would have been extremely expensive. Similarly, taking a bus or tube would have been overwhelming with the stroller, lack of elevators, etc. So, this was perfect!\nTower Bridge\nWe took the Hop-On Hop-Off Bus to stop 17, which was the Tower of London. We walked over to the Tower and right in front of it, you have a PERFECT view of the Tower Bridge, which is London's most iconic bridge. Many people think this bridge is the London Bridge, but it's actually not!\nTower of London\nVisiting the Tower of London was one of my favorite parts of the entire trip. The Tower of London is described as \"a secure fortress, royal palace and infamous prison where you can explore 1000 years of history.\" You can buy tickets either outside of the Tower, or from the hop-on hop-off bus company I recommended above once you get off the bus. Once you're there, you can visit the world-famous Crown Jewels or you can just walk around outside and take in the amazing architecture and read the plaques. The ladder is what I chose to do!\nI should also note that if you are bringing a stroller, it is extremely bumpy and filled with cobblestones. Thankfully, there is a spot where you can leave your strollers. I recommend bringing a baby carrier and packing light so that you can carry your valuables along with you.\nLondon Bridge & Borough Market\nOnce we were finished visiting the Tower of London, we crossed the Thames River via London Bridge and walked over to Borough Market. Borough Market is the most popular and one of the oldest markets in the entire United Kingdom! If you're looking for a place to eat, this is the spot. Borough Market has tons of food stalls and also is filled with baked goods, cheeses, fresh produce, and more.\nWhile at Borough Market, I stopped for lunch at\nfish! Borough Market\nbecause I was DYING for some classic English fish & chips! Wow, it did NOT disappoint. I was so happy to sit down, enjoyed some fried cod and \"chips\" (fries), their classic mashed peas, and an aperol spritz. Highly recommend!\nFrom here, I started walking over to the closest pick-up spot for the hop-on hop-off bus and headed back to the hotel. I met up with Charlie after his day of work meetings and we walked over to a Tapas bar right near our hotel called El Pirata for a Pimms Cup (a classic London cocktail!), pan con tomate, and papas bravas. It was a really great local spot sitting on a side street near our hotel. It just felt really authentic and nottouristy at all!\nLondon Itinerary Day 3: Piccadilly Street/Circus, Covent Garden, All the Food!\nThis was one of my absolute favorite days while there! I didn't take any public transit this day or any buses/cars, and got everywhere by foot. It was SO fun walking around and exploring/getting lost in the city. Here's what we did on day three!\nFortnum & Mason\nI left the hotel early in the morning and walked down Piccadilly Street, which is one of the most icon streets in the city! It has a ton of nice hotels, royal parks, world-class museums, and fancy department stores. While walking down the street, I stopped into\nFortnum & Mason\nwhich is a fancy department store with tons of treats and goodies. Of course, I picked up some chocolates to bring to the park later - there was SO. MUCH. CHOCOLATE. there!! Walking around, there was classical music playing and all I could think to myself was how amazing this place would be during Christmas. It really felt like something out of a movie and I recommend stopping here.\nCovent Garden\nFrom Fortnum & Mason, we kept walking and walked all the way to Covent Garden which I LOVED. It was my favorite market of all the ones I visited that trip. There were so many cute craft vendors with little trinkets, and then more luxurious shops like Jo Malone and more. I found a little spot outside in the square to sit with Eleanor and get an aperol spritz after walking around the market. On the way to Covent Garden from Fortnum & Mason, you'll also pass Piccadilly Circus which is a famous town square in London. It is said to be like the \"Times Square of London.\" This is definitely not somewhere I'd enjoy spending much time, but a must-see nonetheless!\nLunch at Dishoom\nDid you know that London is known for its Indian food?! When I posted I was going to London, I got ~100 messages on my Instagram letting me know that I HAVE to eat at Dishoom, which serves small Indian plates. I didn't have intentions of eating at a ton of restaurants while visiting, but I knew I wanted to eat at\nDishoom\n. There is a Covent Garden location, so it was really easy to just walk right over after visiting the market! Wow, this might have been one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. I recommend making a reservation in advance. Based on all of your recommendations, I ordered the House Black Daal, Chicken Berry Britannia, and Bowl of Greens. OMG. Drooling just thinking about it, and couldn't recommend this restaurant more!\nBask in Green Park\nAfter eating at Dishoom, I walked over to Green Park, which is another Royal Park in London! It is right next to Buckingham Palace. While you're there, you can rent a \"deck chair\" (or lawn chair) and sit and people watch/soak in the sun in this gorgeous park. I packed along my\nGathre mat\nwhich I bring everywhere, found a spot in the shade, and read my book while Eleanor got in some tummy time. I loved the vibe in this park.\nDinner at Dalloway Terrace\nIf you're looking to have dinner at a restaurant that feels like you're sitting in Anthropologie, look no further than\nDalloway Terrace\n. We made a reservation based off a recommendation from an Instagram friend, and took a black cab over here for an outdoor dinner. The terrace is filled with the most exquisite flower wall and it felt magical in there. I recommend an aperol spritz, the buffalo burrata appetizer, and the Thai green coconut curry \ud83d\ude42\nLondon Itinerary Day 4: Harrods, Kensington Gardens/Palace, Afternoon Tea\nCharlie left for Amsterdam for more work meetings this morning, so it was another wonderful day strolling London with my daughter. This time, we went west from our hotel and checked out a whole different area of the city!\nHarrods\nEven if you don't like shopping, you have to check out Harrods. It's one of the most famous luxury department stores in the world. It was founded by Charles Harrod in 1835 and grew to be the best-known British department store in the world. It has been visited by celebrities, politicians, royalty, and the British elite. If you visit Harrods, you NEED to go to the food hall! It is an unbelievable food emporium and the perfect place to pick up to-go food and bring for a picnic. Even if you aren't planning to eat there, it's definitely worth a visit!\nKensington Gardens & Palace, Princess Diana Memorial Fountain\nOf all the parks I visited, Kensington Gardens was my favorite! The gardens are another one of London\u2019s royal parks and covers 265 acres. It\u2019s a beautiful green space and if the weather is nice, I recommend just strolling around.\nWhile you're in Kensington Gardens, walk on over to the\nKensington Palace\n. Kensington Palace a grand 17th century home that was first used as a royal residence by King William II and Queen Mary II. It continued to be used as a royal residence by a British monarch through the reign of King George II. Since then, it has been used as the residence and workplace of \u201cminor royalty\u201d, and is still an active working royal palace.\nAnother place you'll be able to visit while in the Gardens is the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. This is technically in Hyde Park, but very close to the Kensington Palace!\nAfternoon Tea at Number Sixteen in South Kensington\nI knew I wanted to go to afternoon tea while in London, but it was overwhelming how many places there were to do it! When someone on Instagram recommended Number Sixteen to me and told me it was outside in a garden, I was immediately sold. Wherever you go, you should definitely make reservations in advance! If you don't know what afternoon tea is, it originated in the aristocratic homes of England in the 19th century. It is a light meal composed of sandwiches, scones with butter and jam, sweet pastries, and tea (you can also get champagne if you so choose!). Number Sixteen was just a short walk from Kensington Gardens, so it worked out perfectly into the structure of our day! The setting of the tea was just stunning.\nGrab a Coffee at EL&N\nEL&N is known for being \"the most Instagrammable cafe in the world\" - and this is extremely accurate! On the walk from afternoon tea back to the hotel, I walked right past EL&N and decided to stop inside for a latte to-go for the walk home. I recommend finding time to stop by and grab a coffee or pastry here. It was SO cute!\nIn London, there is something called a \"Meal Deal\" offered by most local grocery stores. While there, because I wanted to save money on meals, I took advantage of this from Tesco (a local supermarket). The deal is that for just \u00a33, you can get a sandwich, snack (chips or fruit, for example) and soda! This went such a long way in helping me save money while I was there.\nLondon Itinerary Day 5: Heading Home!\nOn the fifth day, it was time to head back to the United States. This was quite the long day of travel, alone with a four-month-old. I woke up, took a black cab to Paddington Station, and took the Heathrow Express to the airport. I then flew from Heathrow back to Washington Dulles.\nOverall, it was such a lovely time and I'm so glad I decided to go on this trip. I was absolutely terrified and felt insane for taking what was essentially a solo international trip with my four-month-old daughter. But, I'm SO so so happy I just went for it. It's been less than four days since returning home and I already don't remember the hassle of getting back, but know the memories I made there will last me a lifetime.\nNot feeling an international trip?

Images by Jessica Wright.\nHaving lived in London for almost a decade now, I\u2019ve come to enjoy its varying neighborhoods and thriving creative scene. And I\u2019m still not over being able to walk past centuries-old historic corners. Whether cozying up beside the fireplace in a pub on a cold winter\u2019s evening or making the most of long summer days in the city\u2019s green spaces, London is perfect to visit any time of the year.\nIf you\u2019re heading to London for the first time, I always recommend three days as the perfect taster trip. It gives you enough time to see the iconic sights the city is known for, enjoy a few quintessential London activities, and visit some of the city\u2019s best neighborhoods. This itinerary will guide you through how to make the most of that time in England\u2019s capital.\nLondon is a big city and with dozens of museums, plenty of monuments, and hundreds of incredible coffee shops, restaurants, and pubs, narrowing down exactly what to see can feel like a challenge. That\u2019s where this itinerary for 3 days in London will help you maximize your time in the British capital.\nShort on Time?

From how to best navigate the destinations on this itinerary to when to visit, these are some tips to ensure you have a great trip to London.\nHow to Get Around\nOne of the things I love most is how well-connected London is. The tube takes you from east to west and north to south on colorful lines that intersect throughout the city. Those cherry-red double-decker buses take you from A to B above ground, and you can even take in the sights from the Thames via a river boat. And of course, you can walk between destinations too when they\u2019re closer together.\nOyster is London\u2019s tap-on/tap-off public transport payment system. You can top up a card and use it to tap on and off for most journeys (you only need to tap on but not off for buses) and it will charge you based on your journey. Alternatively, your credit card can also be used the same way if your provider allows it.\nBook Tickets for Attractions in Advance\nIf you\u2019re planning to visit popular attractions such as the\nTower of London\n, it\u2019s recommended to book your ticket in advance. Sometimes tickets sell out in advance or you may spend time waiting in long queues, so choosing your date and (sometimes time) for entry is advisable.\nCheck Which Airport\nMost international flights will arrive/depart at London Heathrow or London Gatwick airports, however five airports are typically listed for flights to and from London, especially if you\u2019re arriving from European destinations. London Heathrow and London City are the most convenient and well-connected airports that are closer to central London. I\u2019d recommend avoiding flights to/from London Stansted or London Luton airports, as they are quite far north of the city.\nDay 1: Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, and Covent Garden\nBig Ben and Westminster Abbey\nThe best place to start your trip to London is in the historic and iconic area of Westminster. Home to the Houses of Parliament and Elizabeth Tower (where you\u2019ll find\nBig Ben\n), it\u2019s best to arrive here early in the morning. As black cabs and red double-deckers drive over Westminster Bridge, it will feel like scenes straight out of a movie. From Westminster Bridge, you can also spot the\nLondon Eye\nin Southbank.\nFrom there, make your way to\nWestminster Abbey\n. Considered an architectural masterpiece with styles from the 13th to 16th centuries, it\u2019s a treasure of London. You can choose to\ntake a guided tour and visit the interior\nwhich will highlight the history of the Abbey as well as showcase numerous historical artifacts through several exhibitions.\nBuckingham Palace and Hyde Park\nLondon is known for its green spaces and the next part of your day will take you through a few of them. Walking through\nSt James Park\nfrom Westminster Abbey you\u2019ll spot ponds, shaded park spaces, and swans. In spring and summer, the gardens are in bloom with beautiful floral displays and it\u2019s the perfect place for a picnic lunch.\nAt the opposite end of St James Park is\nBuckingham Palace\n. The official residence of His Majesty King Charles III, and one of the top spots for tourists to visit in London. For a few weeks each summer you can also\nbook to visit the state rooms\n, usually from July to September. From Buckingham Palace, head across the road and you\u2019ll enter\nHyde Park\n. Enjoy an afternoon out on a\nboat or pedalo in The Serpentine\n, wander through the rose garden, or enjoy\nroyal high tea at Kensington Palace\n. There are also several cafes and huts selling drinks and ice creams making it a great spot for a sunny afternoon.\nIf you\u2019re into history, the\nChurchill War Rooms\nis also located on the edge of the park and offers an immersive look into what life was like during the Second World War.\nCovent Garden\nCovent Garden is a must-visit while in London. Home to\nThe Apple Market\n, several west-end shows, and plenty of restaurants, cafes, and shops, it\u2019s a great place to wind up your day. From Hyde Park, you can jump on the tube and head here. There are regular exhibitions from local artists on display in the market building or piazza, as well as pop-up events celebrating everything from Wimbledon to Christmas.\nThe area is home to some great cafes and coffee shops, including\nGrind\n,\nFair Shot Cafe\n, and\nMonmouth Coffee\n. I also recommend grabbing a freshly baked cinnamon bun from\nBuns from Home\n.\nCovent Garden is a great spot for dinner with plenty of choice of cuisine. Some of my personal favorites are\nAve Mario\nserving up Italian in a boldly decorated interior,\nSUSHISAMBA\nwhich has a lovely open terrace in a Grade II listed building, and\nDishoom\nwhich offers modern Indian cuisine.\nTo end your day, walk down towards\nWaterloo Bridge\nand take in the scenes along the Thames where the\nLondon Eye\nis lit up at night.\nDay 2: Tower Bridge, Tower of London, Sky Garden, Borough Market, Piccadilly and Soho\nTower Bridge and Tower of London\nIn the morning start with a coffee at\nWatchHouse Coffee\n, before heading to one of London\u2019s defining landmarks,\nTower Bridge\n. With its two towers and sky-blue and white beams, it\u2019s a stunning architectural addition to London\u2019s skyline. If you want to, you can visit the two towers and walk across the glass walkway above the road below for a unique view of the bridge.\nFrom here, head over to the north side of the Thames to the\nTower of London\n. Home to the Crown Jewels and steeped in history, this castle has been UNESCO Heritage listed and is home to the Ravens who are known as the guardians of the Tower. You can easily spend one to two hours visiting the\nTower of London\n.\nSky Garden\nThere are several iconic places to get a bird\u2019s eye view of London, but my favorite is\nSky Garden\n. This viewpoint has 360-degree views across the city, two bars, and a restaurant, all among a lush indoor botanical garden. I don\u2019t recommend eating here, as your next stop is all about food, and you\u2019ll want to save space. Tickets to Sky Garden are available three weeks in advance and are free, but you do need to book a timed entry.\nBorough Market\nHead across London Bridge and straight to\nBorough Market\nfor lunch. In the last 30 years or so, this historic market has become a mainstay of London\u2019s food scene, filled with dozens of brilliant food and drink stalls, as well as brick-and-mortar stores, cafes, and restaurants. For a lighter lunch, I recommend the gooey grilled cheese sandwiches from\nKappacasein\nor the slow-cooked meat baguettes from\nHobbs Roast\n.\nIf you\u2019re looking for something more substantial,\nAgora souvla bar\noffers great Greek dishes based around a charcoal rotisserie, or\nBrindisa Kitchen Bar\nserves classic Spanish cuisine. For those with a sweet tooth,\nHumble Crumble\nis a must-try thanks to its farmers market fruity base topped with crunchy crumble and vanilla custard.\nLastly, if you\u2019re a fan of modern design, the\nMillennium Bridge\nand\nTate Modern Museum\nare also on this side of town and worth considering a visit.\nPiccadilly Circus and Soho\nPiccadilly is the home of London\u2019s theater scene and the iconic neon-lit square that earned the \u2018circus\u2019 part of the area\u2019s name. The most remarkable thing about these light-up billboards is that they\u2019re never turned off, they run 24/7. There are numerous theaters in the area showing some of the most popular musicals in the world, including Les Miserables, Matilda, and The Book of Mormon. It\u2019s worth checking out if there are any shows you\u2019d like to catch while in town.\nFrom Piccadilly Circus, you can explore the surrounding areas including\nTrafalgar Square\nand the\nNational Gallery\n, over to Regent and Oxford Streets for shopping, or\nLeicester Square\n.\nFortnum and Mason\nand\nLiberty of London\nare must-visit stores that showcase some of the UK\u2019s best produce and a great place to pick up some souvenirs to take home. If you\u2019re visiting in December, Fortnum and Mason also have an excellent Christmas display and decorations that are worth visiting.\nSoho is a great place to end your day due to its vibrant dining scene. Foodies will appreciate the abundance of choice in cuisine from Italian and Indian to Iranian and Japanese. A few recommendations I\u2019d suggest include\nBerenjak\nfor Iranian grilled tandoor, grab Spanish at\nBarrafina\n, and vegetarians will love\nMildreds\n. Generally, Greek Street has great restaurant offerings and I recommend making a reservation if you have your heart set on eating somewhere in particular.\nDay 3: Kensington, Museums, Notting Hill and Afternoon Tea\nKensington and V&A or Natural History Museum\nYou can\u2019t visit London without stopping by at least one museum and best of all, many are free to enter. While there are dozens to choose from, my favorites are located in South Kensington; the\nVictoria and Albert Museum\nand the\nNatural History Museum\n. The first is great for art lovers and offers a range of paid temporary exhibitions, from musical icons to fashion powerhouses. The Natural History Museum is perfect for families, with displays ranging from botany to zoology and science and several interactive exhibits.\nIf you want to grab breakfast before heading to one of the museums,\nFarm Girl\nand\nCoco Momo\nare great brunch options in Kensington.\nNotting Hill\nStaying in West London, head over to Notting Hill. Much loved by locals and visitors alike, the colorful mews and townhouses make this the insta-perfect spot. Notting Hill has numerous great eateries making a good place to stop for lunch today.\nAkub\noffers delicious Palestinian cuisine in a quaint street,\nOrasay\nis a great seafood restaurant inspired by the Outer Hebrides, or try out\nTaqueria\nfor low-key Mexican dining.\nIf your itinerary in London falls on a Saturday,\nPortobello Road Market\nruns along the street with stall holders selling handcrafted goods, antiques, vintage cameras, and tons of food choices. It can become quite busy, especially when the weather is great, so I\u2019d recommend starting here in the morning and then heading to Kensington afterward. Even if you don\u2019t visit Notting Hill on a Saturday, there are loads of independent shops and boutiques worth browsing.\nTraditional Afternoon Tea\nIf there\u2019s one thing that feels quintessentially British, it\u2019s afternoon tea in London. Finger sandwiches, scones with jam and clotted cream, and a good brew are the perfect way to spend an afternoon and it\u2019s a year-round activity that can\u2019t be dampened by bad weather. When it comes to choosing where to enjoy afternoon tea, you\u2019re spoiled for choice.\nFor a timeless classic, I highly recommend afternoon tea at\nThe Palm Parlour at The Ritz\n. The\nDrawing Room at Brown\u2019s Hotel\nhas a great atmosphere without needing to be overly formal, and\nDean Street Townhouse\noffers a budget-friendly afternoon tea option under \u00a350 per person.\nAs your trip draws to a close, you can either spend your final hours wandering around neighborhoods like Marylebone with its upscale restaurants and boutiques or wander along the Thames at Southbank.\nMore Helpful London Posts\n48 Hours in London: Best Things to Do in 2 Days\nThe 15 Essential Things to Do in London\nWhere to Stay in London: Best Areas For First-Timers\nSave This Post for Later on Pinterest\nPS \u2014 Are You Booking a Trip Soon?

This will keep you from spending unnecessary time on London\u2019s metro (aka the Tube and the Underground) and backtracking through the city.\nAlso, we grouped some of the most expensive activities into days 2, 3, and 4, so you can take advantage of the London Pass (more about this at the end of the post).\nAlso, at the end of this post, we give recommendations on how to shorten this London itinerary if you only have 2, 3, or 4 days to spend in London.\nThe provided walking distances are the amount of walking you will do to get between sites. These do not include the amount of walking you will do inside museums, art galleries, etc.\n5 Day London Itinerary\nDay 1:\nArrive in London, Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour, the London Eye\nDay 2:\nWestminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Whitehall, Covent Garden\nDay 3:\nTower of London, Tower Bridge, Borough Market, Tate Modern, St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Sky Garden\nDay 4:\nNational Gallery, Greenwich, Prime Meridian, Up at the O2\nDay 5:\nBritish Museum, Afternoon Tea, Portobello Road Market, Museums in Kensington\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nLondon Itinerary: Day 1\nArrive in London\nDepending on your flight, most likely you will arrive in London in the morning. Check into your hotel and get settled. Only take a nap if you desperately need one. It\u2019s better to drink some coffee and stay awake so you can adjust to the time change as quickly as possible. It\u2019s amazing what getting out into the sunshine can do to revive tired travelers. However, it is London, so there is the chance that the sun will be hidden behind the clouds.\nTo get to your hotel from the airport, you can take a taxi or\nhire a private driver\n(expensive, about 45 minutes, but most likely will be longer depending on traffic), take the Underground (cheap, about 1 hour), or take the Heathrow Express to Paddington station and then take the Underground to your hotel (about 45 minutes but varies depending on hotel location).\nHop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour\nNormally, we do not recommend bus tours. Unless you are in London. This city is huge and the list of sites to see is long. Taking a bus tour is a great way to get an overview of this amazing city. Plus, it\u2019s the perfect, low-key activity for jet-lagged travelers.\nThere are multiple companies that offer Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tours. Big Bus, Golden Tour, and The Original Tour are the most popular. We recommend\nBig Bus\n, only because this is whom we used and we had a good experience.\nMost companies offer multiple routes through the city. Tickets are valid for one, two, and three days, and extra excursions may be added in, such as a river ride on the Thames. For the purpose of today, all you need is a basic 24-hour ticket.\nTo get an overview of the city, I recommend the Red Route with Big Bus. This route takes you past the main sites without going too far out of the way. Enjoy the journey as you glide by Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Buckingham Palace, and the River Thames.\nPRO TRAVEL TIP:\nIf you purchase your tickets online in advance, you will save money compared to purchasing them same-day on the city street.\nTake a Ride on the London Eye\nA ride on the London Eye is another ultra-touristy thing to do in London, but if this is your first time in the city, it\u2019s thrilling to look down on the River Thames, Parliament, and over the London skyline.\nLondon Eye | 5 Day London Itinerary\nCost:\nTickets start at \u00a329 if you book in advance. If you want to skip the line, choose the Fast Track option (slightly more expensive). Tickets are available on the official website and through\nGetYourGuide.\nHours:\n10:00 am \u2013 8:30 pm, although hours change frequently depending on the season. Visit the London Eye\nwebsite\nfor more information.\nGetting here:\nUse the bus tour to get here, hop off and ride the London Eye, and then hop back on the bus to complete the loop back to your hotel (or your starting destination).\nHave dinner and go to bed early to get that much needed sleep.\nRELATED:\nLondon Bucket List: 50 Epic Things to Do in London\nLondon Itinerary: Day 2\nWestminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Whitehall, Covent Garden\nWalking Distance: 6.1 km (3.8 miles)\nHow to Use This Map:\nClick the tab in the top left corner of the map to see a list of the points of interest and to turn layers on/off.

It helps to get here early (as much as an hour early during the very busy summer months) to get a good spot.\nIf you want to watch the Changing of the Guard from the best vantage points and learn more about this tradition,\nthis walking tour\ngets great reviews.\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nIf this is something that\u2019s at the top of your list to do in London, you can visit Buckingham Palace before Westminster Abbey. However, the Changing of the Guard will take up most of your morning and then you will be dealing with long lines and crowds at Westminster Abbey.\nIn our opinion, your time is better spent at Westminster Abbey than joining the crowds at the Changing of the Guard.\nDuring the months of August and September, and select times during the rest of the year, you can tour the State Rooms of Buckingham Palace. Learn more\nhere.\nLunch\nNext we will be walking over to Whitehall. Restaurants on Whitehall either mediocre or expensive (your best bet on Whitehall is The Red Lion). There are numerous restaurants to try just south of Buckingham Palace, including Bon Gusto (Italian), Quilon (Indian and Asian), or Buckingham Arms (bar/pub located on at 62 Petty France).\nChurchill War Rooms\nAfter lunch, walk to the Churchill War Rooms. This museum has two parts to it. At the\nChurchill Museum\nyou learn about the life and legacy of Winston Churchill. Then you enter the\nCabinet War Rooms\n. This is the underground bunker where Churchill and his staff ran their operations during World War II.\nThis museum is fascinating and you do not need to be a history buff to appreciate this visit. If you want to learn more about Winston Churchill before your visit to London, consider watching the movie\nDarkest Hour\nor reading the book\nThe Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, Defiance During the Blitz\nby Erik Larson. It is about Winston Churchill\u2019s first year as prime minister during the bombings by Hitler. This story is told by using the journals from Churchill\u2019s inner circle and it provides a fascinating insight on the mind of Churchill and what it was like to live through this time period.\nTo skip the line, purchase your fast track tickets\nonline\nin advance.\nCost:\nAdults \u00a332, Child (5-15) \u00a316\nHours:\n9:30 am \u2013 6:00 pm, last admission at 5 pm\nWebsite:\nGet updated hours and pricing before you go on the\nofficial website.\nTour of the Churchill War Rooms:\nGet more out of your visit on this\nsmall group tour\nof the Churchill War Rooms and war sites in Westminster.\nBig Ben\nFrom the Churchill War Rooms, walk towards Westminster Bridge along Great George Street/A302.

We kept our visit quick (about an hour) and were still able to tour most of the museum.\nThe Tate Modern is worth it if you are an art lover, but it is skippable if you are not.

The pass will pay for most of your activities on days 2, 3, and 4. On these three days, if you did\neverything\n, your cost would be \u00a3203.20. The cost of a 3-day London Pass was \u00a3184 when I did this pricing update in January 2025 (a savings of \u00a319.2).\nIt is possible to purchase the London Pass with a discount during certain months of the year.\nGetYourGuide\nalso has discounted pricing for the London Pass.\nAnother advantage of having the London Pass is that you do not need to order numerous tickets online in advance. Purchasing the London Pass not only saves money but also time.\nLearn more about the London Pass on their\nwebsite\n.\nI do not recommend adding on the Oyster Card through the London Pass. It is slightly cheaper if you purchase the Oyster Card separately.\nAbout the Oyster Card\nThe Oyster Card is a smartcard that you use to pay for transportation in London, including the Tube, trams, buses, and more. Before you travel to London, you can purchase an Oyster Card online and have it shipped to your home. Or, you can buy an Oyster Card at Underground Stations, Gatwick Airport, and Heathrow Airport.

Each time you scan the card to enter the Underground or board a bus, the fare will be deducted from the card.

For five days in London, start with\u00a0\u00a335.

London has six main airports: Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, Southend, and London City, and these airports collectively serve just about every region of the world. If you are arriving from an international location outside Europe, busy\nHeathrow\nis likely to be your arrival airport. See this\nairport guide\nfor getting to and from each of the airports in London.\nIf you are arriving by train, London is well-connected to train routes throughout the UK and Europe with a number of train stations in and around central London. Those arriving from Scotland might want to consider an\novernight sleeper train\n.\nIf you are arriving from continental Europe by train or car, you\u2019ll need to travel across the English Channel on\nEuroStar\nor take a ferry.\nGetting around London\nLondon is best explored either on foot or by public transportation. Cabs and bike hires are also good options. If you need to book a cab, you can use\nminicabit\nto compare prices.\nI would not recommend driving in London unless you are planning to stay on the outskirts of the city as driving and finding parking in central busy locations can be a nightmare and parking can be expensive.\nIf you are driving to London, I\u2019d park your car when you arrive in the city and then use public transport until you leave.\nLondon\u2019s has a great public transportation network and most visitors spend at least some time traveling on it. This includes public bus, tram, and rail services (including \u201cthe Tube\u201d) within the city. You can buy individual tickets for each ride, but many visitors get an\nOyster Card\nwhich allows you to travel on almost all the city\u2019s public transit options and can save you time and money.\nIf you are considering an Oyster Card, you can read our full review of it\nhere\n.\nFor more information and tips on getting around London, check out our detailed\nGuide To Transportation Options in London\n.\nWhere to Stay for 6 Days in London\nAccommodation wise, London has about every lodging option you can imagine, from\ninexpensive hostels\nto self-catering\napartments\nto pricey 5-star\nluxury hotels\n. London is home to some really iconic classic luxury hotels like\nThe Ritz\n,\nThe Dorchester\n,\nBrown\u2019s\n, and\nThe Savoy\n.\nBut it also has a number of mid-range and budget friendly chains like\nHoliday Inn Express\n,\nTravelodge\n,\nBest Western\n,\nPremier Inn\n,\nIbis\n, and\nPoint.a Hotels\n. If you are spending a full week in London, you can often save money by booking\nan apartment\nat a weekly versus daily rate.\nTo find the best rates on hotels in London, we recommend searching on\nBooking.com\nor\nHotels.com\nas in our experience these two sites tend to have the best prices and widest choice on both hotels and a range of apartments.\nIf you are looking for self-catering apartments or rooms, we recommend checking out\nPlum Guide\n. We\u2019ve tried many of the apartment rental sites, and have usually had the best experiences with Plum Guide. Of course,\u00a0there are also loads of\nAirbnb alternative booking sites\nyou can check.\nBased on our various trips to London, we\u2019ve put together few suggestions across budgets to give you some ideas for where to stay in the city, which are sorted from lowest to highest price:\nThe Walrus Bar and Hostel\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 This is a well reviewed and centrally located hostel, found only a 15 minute walk from Parliament Square and the Palace of Westminster (Big Ben).\nSoHostel\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Another well-reviewed hostel located just at the edge of Westminster, only a 15 minute walk from Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery.\nPoint A Hotel\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 This hotel is located within Westminster and is within the well-priced Point A hotel range. It\u2019s a 17 minute walk to Parliament Square and Westminster Abbey. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stayed here; rooms are tiny but clean and a great budget option.\nPremier Inn\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 This well-rated mid-range 3-star option is located near to Borough Market and London Bridge.\nHilton Tower Bridge\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 This well-rated hotel offers good value for this class of hotel and is located within a short walk of Tower Bridge, London Bridge, and Borough Market.\nResident Victoria Hotel\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 A centrally located 4-star hotel offering excellent value for money located near Buckingham Palace.

Luckily, there are a number of London discount passes you can purchase which can help you save money if you plan to visit a number of London\u2019s museums and attractions.\nOur favorite is the\nLondon Pass\nwhich allows free entry into over 60 of London\u2019s top attractions, and also comes with a free hop-on, hop-off bus ticket and additional discounts on food, shopping, and tours.\nWe\u2019ve used the London Pass on a number of visits and have written a\nfull review of the London Pass\nwhich you can read to help determine if it is a good fit for your trip. Also be sure to check out all the free attractions in London which include top-notch museums, parks, historic sites, special events, and festivals.\nAnother discount card option is the\nGoCity London Explorer Pass\nwhere you can choose up to 7 attractions you want to visit (out of 50+) where you can get free entry into all these attractions (including Westminster Abbey, St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Tower of London). See a\nfull list of possible attractions here\n.\nThis GoCity London Explorer Pass doesn\u2019t work as well with our suggested itinerary but may be more appealing to some, especially families, as it includes more attractions geared to families that are not included on the London Pass.\nBuying Tickets for London Attractions\nWhen you are planning on buying tickets for attractions in London, you have two main options. You can book online in advance, or for some attractions, you can buy tickets in person.\nFor most attractions we would recommend booking online in advance, as this means you can skip the in-person ticket lines. Many attractions also now operate a timed entry system, so turning up on the day might lead to disappointment.\nBooking online in advance is usually the best option, and it also often results in slightly better value tickets compared to on-the-door prices.\nYou then have the option for most attractions of buying direct, or buying via a third-party site like\nGetYourGuide\n,\nViator\nor\nTiqets\n.\nIt is always worth comparing prices across the different options, as well as the cancellation policies. Generally, our preferred option is\nGetYourGuide\nbecause they normally offer a full refund up to 24 hours in advance of your visit to most attractions. The prices are nearly always the same as the official site as well.\nOf course, you will need to check each attraction\u2019s policy and compare, but for peace of mind this policy can be very helpful.\nWalking Tours in London\nWhen visiting a new city, or when we just want to get a bit more local insight into somewhere we\u2019ve been before, we\u2019ll often take a walking tour. These offer a couple of advantages as they help orientate you to a new place plus you can get insider tips from a local on the best places to visit and eat.\nWe\u2019ve taken a number of walking tours in London, and I did this\nfull day London walking tour\non my very first visit to London which covered all the central highlights and includes a\nvisit to the Tower of London\n, the Changing of the Guard, a short Thames cruise, and a view of all the main sites in Westminster. I did this tour on my very first visit to London and really enjoyed it!\nOur favorite walking tour company is\nTake Walks\n, who are behind the popular Walks of Italy walking tour company. They now offer a number of tours in London, and we can highly recommend them if you are looking for a walking tour in the city.

We also have a post about seeing the best of the city and its royal sites in a\none day London walking tour\n.\nWe have written a ton of content about London based on our experiences, so you can check out our\nLondon articles on Finding the Universe\nand our\nLondon articles\non this blog for more info and to see where we\u2019ve been.\nFor additional planning resources, the\nVisit London\nand\nVisit Great Britain\nwebsites also offer tons of helpful information for visitors. If your travels are taking you beyond London, you can check out Laurence\u2019s suggested\n2-week UK itinerary\nto get you started.\nA 6 Day London Itinerary: How to Spend 6 Days in London\nLondon is one of those cities that has an endless\u00a0amount of attractions, museums, shows, and potential things to do. This can be overwhelming for many visitors so we\u2019ve put together our suggested 6 day itinerary that takes in London\u2019s most popular attractions as well as several of London\u2019s best neighborhoods.\nI\u2019ve also tried to arrange them in a logical order so you spend less time traveling around the city and more time seeing the sights.\nUse this as a guide and starting point for planning your 6 days in London, not as a definitive itinerary, to put together your own personalized itinerary that reflects your own needs and interests. Be sure to check on admission days and hours for any must-see attractions before you set out as many attractions close for one day per week or may be closed due to a special event or renovation.\nFor all attractions with an admission fee, we\u2019ve noted there is an entry fee by writing \u201c(fee)\u201d next to them. Note that since many people use the\nLondon Pass\n, the attractions that are included on the London Pass are starred (*) denoting that passholders receive free entry so they have \u201c(fee*)\u201d next to them.\nWe do our best to provide the most updated information, but things change so you may want to double-check fees and London Pass inclusions before your trip.\nLondon Itinerary Day 1 \u2013 Westminster\nOn your first full day in London, I\u2019d head to Westminster. Westminster is a great place to start your exploration of London as it is the political, cultural, and geographical center of the city.\nIt is also where you\u2019ll find some of London\u2019s most iconic and famous buildings. The itinerary starts and stops near Parliament Square but can begin it at any point along the route.\nThe map below shows a suggested walking route with the major Day 1 London itinerary locations noted. Click\nhere\nor on the map below for a closer look and to see exact locations:\nCity Tour\nFirst, you might consider taking a tour to get oriented to the city. If you are the kind of person who likes to get a good overview of a city before striking out on your own, a sightseeing bus tour, bike tour, Thames river cruise, or city walking tour is a great way to get oriented.\nYou have loads of options in terms of companies and London Pass holders have access to a free\nsightseeing hop-on hop-off bus tour\n, bike tour, and a Thames cruise which all cover the Westminster area. If this sounds appealing, I\u2019d probably recommend either a walking or bus tour for your first day.\nIf you choose a walking tour, most need to be booked in advance, and you can read about one of the guided\nwalking tours of Westminster\nwe did on my very first trip to London to get an idea of what you can cover on foot in the area.\nAs mentioned earlier in the post, we also often use and can recommend walking company\nTake Walks\n. They have a number of\nLondon walking tours\nto get you acquainted with London.\nWestminster Abbey\nWestminster Abbey\n(fee*)\u00a0is definitely one of the most impressive and historical churches in England. The church (and its Norman predecessor) has been the site of all English and British coronations since William the Conqueror in 1066 as well as the site of over a dozen royal weddings, including Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011.\nThe current church dates from 1245, being built mainly from the 13th century to 16th century, and was mostly built in the Gothic style. The church is a coveted burial spot and includes the tombs of British royals as well as Prime Ministers, famous artists, writers, and scientists, and other famous people from the past 1,000 years!\nThis is a popular place so be sure to leave some time to get in and explore. The included audio guide helps give you a lot of background on the church and points out all the highlights. Guide-led tours are also possible for a small extra fee (currently \u00c2\u00a35/person), check at arrival or on the Abbey website for tour times.\nIn June 2018, the\nQueen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee Galleries\nopened. The galleries, which are reached by the newly build Weston Tower, house historical exhibit and treasures owned by the Abbey. Admission to the Galleries is currently an extra \u00c2\u00a35.00 and requires a timed ticket as space is limited. You can buy your tickets online in advance\nhere\n.\nSt. James\u2019s Park\nFor a breath of fresh air, take a walk through St. James\u2019s Park en-route to Buckingham Palace. The park is one of eight of the city\u2019s Royal Parks and has over 50 acres of green spaces, flower beds, and even a lake that contains some famous resident pelicans.\nThere is a small caf\u00c3\u00a9\u00a0here and it is a great place to take a short break. Also for those interested in the Guards regiments of the British Army, you can make a stop at\nThe Guards Museum\n(fee*) which is just across from St. James\u2019s Park, next to the Wellington Barracks.\nBuckingham Palace\nBuckingham Palace is probably the most famous palace in the UK and it serves as the primary London workplace and residence for the reigning sovereign of the United Kingdom. It was originally built as a private residence by the Duke of Buckingham (hence the name) in the early 18th century, but was later acquired by British royalty and expanded over time.\nThe public can tour\nBuckingham Palace\n(fee,\nbook tickets in advance here\n) but only for about 8 weeks per year (generally August and September). We have done that tour and it is definitely worth it if you have the time and budget. However, you can get a good view of the palace from outside the gates year-round and you can walk up to see the marble and bronze Victoria Memorial that stands in front of the palace at the end of The Mall.\nDepending on the day of you visit (as well as weather and security conditions), you may get a chance to see the Changing of the King\u2019s Guard ceremony at the forecourt of Buckingham Palace which often takes place around 11am. The full ceremony lasts about 45 minutes. If you want to see the Changing of the Guard ceremony, check the\nschedule online\nin advance and show up early to get a good viewing spot.\nIf you don\u2019t want to stand in the crowds, you can try going to Friary Court in front of St. James Palace for the ceremony (the Old Guard normally lines up and starts here) or watching the Changing The King\u2019s Lifeguard (horse guards) at the\nHorse Guards Parade\nas both spots attract fewer visitors.\nEven if you can\u2019t visit the State Rooms of Buckingham Place, there are places to visit on the palace grounds year-round. You can visit the\nRoyal Mews\n(fee,\nbook tickets here\n) which showcases the royal collection of historic carriages and coaches, including the Diamond Jubilee State Coach.\nArt lovers will want to stop at the\nKing\u2019s Gallery\n(fee*,\nbook tickets here\n) which displays regularly changing exhibitions of art from the royal collection.\nSt. James\u2019s Palace\nSt James\u2019s Palace\u00a0is the most senior royal palace in the\u00a0United Kingdom, having been built during the reign of King Henry VIII in the 16th century. Although it is no longer the residence of the monarch, it is the meeting place and London residence of members of the British royal family.\nThe palace is not open to the public but as noted above you can see the start of the Changing of the Guard ceremony from Friary Court in front of the palace.\nPiccadilly Circus\nPiccadilly Circus\u00a0is a famous road junction and a popular public meeting spot in London. The area is famous for its large neon signs and video advertising as well as the Shaftesbury Memorial with its statue of Anteros.\nThe spot is well-located for an easy walk to the West End theaters and Regent Street, one of London\u2019s major shopping streets. It\u2019s also going to be familiar to Harry Potter fans as it was one of the\nHarry Potter filming locations in London\n.\nTrafalgar Square\nTrafalgar Square is a popular public square in central London known for its monuments, architecture, street artists, and surrounding museums. The square itself is home to Nelson\u2019s Column (a monument commemorating Admiral Horatio Nelson, who died in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805), the famous stone lion statues, and the featured contemporary art on the Fourth Plinth.\nAround the square you\u2019ll also find two of London\u2019s top art museums, the\nNational Gallery\nand the\nNational Portrait Gallery\n. Both are highly recommended for art lovers and include works by some of the world\u2019s most famous artists from Turner to Monet.\nAlso nearby (hidden underground in St. Martin-in-the-Fields!) you can visit the\nLondon Brass Rubbing\u00a0Centre\n(fee) to learn about and create a brass rubbing to take home. A great activity for families (we had fun too!). Note that this isn\u2019t always available, check the website for when you can do it.\nNational Gallery\nWhitehall & Downing Street\nWhitehall is the main street running south from Trafalgar Square towards\u00a0Parliament Square. This area was once home to the Palace of Whitehall, a sprawling royal palace complex and the largest palace in the world until it burned in 1698. However, today visitors can still see one remaining section of the palace complex, the\nBanqueting Hall\n(fee) designed by famous architect Inigo Jones with a ceiling painted by Peter Paul Reubens.\nToday Whitehall\u00a0is the center of the Government of the United Kingdom and you\u2019ll pass a number of buildings home to various departments and ministries, including the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office. Along this street you\u2019ll also find\nThe Household Calvary Museum\n(fee*), located in the 18th century stables of the Horse Guards,\u00a0which gives information on the history of the Household Cavalry and displays a small collection of uniforms and weapons.\nPast the Banqueting Hall and Household Cavalry Museum, you\u2019ll pass the entrance to Downing Street. The street is gated and guarded, but you can peek through and should be able to see the door to 10 Downing Street, which is the headquarters of the UK government and official residence of the Prime Minister. There are a lot of statues and memorials along the street, including\nThe Cenotaph\n, which has been designated as the United Kingdom\u2019s official national war memorial. As you continue down Whitehall, you\u2019ll end in Parliament Square.\nParliament Square & Houses of Parliament\nParliament Square is a public square where you\u2019ll find a number of statues of famous people, including Winston Churchill, David Lloyd George, Abraham Lincoln, and Nelson Mandela. The square is surrounded by famous buildings, including Westminster Abbey and St. Margaret\u2019s Church, the parish church of the Palace of Westminster.\nOn one side of the square you\u2019ll see the iconic Palace of Westminster, better known as the Houses of Parliament, with the iconic Elizabethan Tower which contains the famous Big Ben bell. The building is named after the former medieval palace that once stood here, and you can actually visit a section of the old palace, the 14th century\nJewel Tower\n(fee*), if you want a sense of what the original Palace of Westminster was like.\nThe public can visit the\nHouses of Parliament\non certain dates, and debates are free for the public to watch. But if you want to actually tour the building, tours are available on certain days of the week and the tours include a number of rooms, including Westminster Hall, St. Stephens Hall, Commons Chamber, and the Lords Chamber. UK residents can contact their local MP or a Member of the House of Lords to request and arrange a free tour. Otherwise, you can\nbook a tour ticket online\nfor a self-guided audio tour or guided tour.\nThe tour here is well worth it if you have the chance to do it during your visit. We did a guided tour plus a Thames-side afternoon tea here and really enjoyed seeing the inside of this iconic building!\nWestminster Bridge\nAfter you have visited all the spots you want to in and around Parliament Square, walk onto Westminster Bridge and look back for a great view of the House of Parliament and the River Thames. You can then take a walk along the Thames or head off to dinner. Tomorrow the itinerary will bring us back to the Thames to further explore more of London\u2019s iconic sites.\nLondon Itinerary Day 2 \u2013\nAlong the River Thames\nToday we\u2019d suggest heading back into central London and focusing on sites located along the famous River Thames, London\u2019s main river and the longest river in England.\nThe Day 2 itinerary takes you to more of London\u2019s most historic and iconic sites and attractions. It starts at the Tower of London and ends either at the Churchill War Rooms or the\nLondon Eye\n, depending on your time, energy, and interests.\nThe first part of the itinerary is walkable but you\u2019ll probably want to use the Thames river boat or public transit to get from the bridges to the Churchill War Rooms. If you want to do a Thames river cruise (fee*), this is a good day for it.\nClick\nhere\nor on the map below for a closer look and to see exact locations, note that the closest pier to the Churchill War Rooms is\nWestminster Pier\nbut this map did not allow us to plot that route:\nTower of London\nThe\nTower of London\n(fee*) is a UNESCO world heritage site that has served as a fortress, prison, armory, Royal Mint, and place of execution among other uses during its long history. It is famous for serving as a prison and execution site of famous people like Queen Anne Boleyn and for housing the Crown Jewels.\nThere is a lot packed in here and highlights include the Crown Jewels, White Tower, Tower Green, and tours given by the Yeomen Warders (Beefeaters). This is a popular place so we\u2019d strongly recommend trying to get here around opening, head to the Crown Jewels first, and plan to spend at least 2 hours visiting here.\nOne of our favorite attractions in central London but also one of the most crowded so do try to get here early.\nYou can\nbuy a ticket online in advance here\n.\nWe also recommend checking prices on the official website\nhere\n, where you can also see opening times.\nFor more on visiting, see our complete\nguide to the Tower of London\n.\nThames Cruise\nToday is a good day to do a sightseeing boat cruise of the River Thames, as all the suggested locations today are alongside the river. There is a\nCity Cruises\n(fee) dock just a short walk from the Tower of London and you can use the cruise to see the city from the Thames and get to the next location with a 24 hour hop on, hop off cruise ticket.\nAnother option is to get a River Roamer pass (fee*) for the\nThames Clipper\n, a commuter boat service, or just buy a single ticket for a one time ride. Of course, you can also just walk to each attraction or take public transit.\nHMS Belfast\nNext suggested stop is\nHMS Belfast\n(fee), which is permanently moored on the Thames a short walk from Tower Bridge on the south bank. This historic warship, operated today by Imperial War Museums, will definitely be of interest to military buffs, or anyone with an interest in boats. Launched just before the outbreak of World War 2, this Royal Navy Light Cruiser saw action in both World War 2 and the Korean War, before being decommissioned in 1963.\nSince 1971 she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a popular London tourist attraction, and you can spend a good deal of time learning all about operational life on board this historic warship.\nThere is a small caf\u00c3\u00a9 next to the visitor entrance to the ship which serves fresh sandwiches, salads, pastries, and coffee if you need a bite to eat.\nTower Bridge and London Bridge\nNext I would take some time to appreciate two of London\u2019s most famous bridges, the London Bridge and Tower Bridge. Both bridges have exhibitions you can visit, although in terms of time I would choose to visit only one exhibition or just admire them both from the outside.\nLondon Bridge is famous for being the subject of the nursery rhyme\u00a0\u201cLondon Bridge Is Falling Down\u201d and there has been a London Bridge since Roman times with the current one dating only to the 1970\u2019s.\nThe London Bridge Experience\n(fee*) is an interactive educational and amusement attraction geared towards families with children and young adults that don\u2019t mind a bit of a scare.\nThe bridge in London which you are probably more familiar with in terms of photos is Tower Bridge, often mistakenly called London Bridge by tourists. This iconic bridge opened in 1894 and is currently painted white and blue.\nIf you want to learn more about the bridge, then you should visit the\nTower Bridge Exhibition\n(fee*).\u00a0Here you can learn about the history of the bridge, including how it was built and how the lifting mechanism works to allow ships through. You can also walk the glass floor walkway across the bridge, a 138 feet high walkway that will definitely test any fear of heights you may have!\nview down from glass walkway of Tower Bridge!\nAlternatives\n(or additional spots) in the area to the above attractions:\nSouthwark Cathedral\n, Borough Market (one of London\u2019s most famous food markets),\nThe Old Operating Theatre Museum\n(fee*),\nThe Monument\n(fee*), and\nThe View from the Shard\n(fee*).\nChurchill War Rooms\nNow, we are going to head back to Westminster to visit the Churchill War Rooms which are not too far from where you were yesterday. You\u2019ll likely want to hop on the Thames boat to Westminster Pier or take public transit here.\nThe\nChurchill War Rooms\n(fee) are run by the Imperial War Museums (those with a military history interest will also want to visit the Imperial War Museum in London) and allow the public to visit the huge underground secret bunker where the majority of the war effort during World War 2 was directed from August 1939 to August 1945.\nThe visit essentially includes two places: the Cabinet War Rooms and the Churchill Museum. You get to visit an interesting maze of rooms to see where communications and strategizing happened as well as where people ate, slept, and cooked during WW2. Then a separate large museum room is devoted to the life of Winston Churchill and his legacy. It has the best collection of information and exhibits on Churchill that I have visited, and it covers his life from birth to death, not just the war years.\nThere is an excellent audio guide included with the tour that covers the Cabinet War Rooms, For those with an interest in Churchill, we recommend checking out this article about visiting some of the\ntop Winston Churchill sites\n.\nFor those with an interest in Churchill and the London Blitz, we can also recommend the\nLondon Churchill War Room tour\nby Context Travel which includes a guided visit to the Churchill War Rooms as well as a guided tour of parts of London related to the Blitz.\nWe love Context Travel tours, which are geared to the intellectually curious travelers, and if you book this tour or any other tour with Context Travel, using the link above you\u2019ll receive 10% off any Context Travel tour anywhere in the world. Be sure to book in advance of your trip.\nLondon Dungeon\nIf you still have time and energy you might want to continue on across the Westminster Bridge to where you\u2019ll find more attractions, including the London Dungeon and the London Eye.\nThe\nLondon Dungeon\n(fee) is an interactive attraction that uses costumed actors, rides, special effects, and staging to tell London\u2019s more sinister history while offering up a bit of fun and scares. I wouldn\u2019t come here for a history lesson but if you enjoy haunted houses and amusement parks, you\u2019ll probably enjoy this. Not recommended for young children.\nThe dungeon also sometimes offers adult-only nights that include food and drinks. Depending on who you are, the London Dungeon is either a must-see or a must-avoid! Next door to the Dungeon are also two family-oriented attractions, the\nSea Life London Aquarium\nand\nDreamWorks Tours: Shrek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Adventure\n.\nLondon Eye\nThe\nLondon Eye\n(fee*) is Europe\u2019s tallest observation wheel and is essentially a giant slow ferris wheel with large, enclosed glass pods. The London Eye is a great place to get some nice views of London, although I\u2019d pass if the weather is terrible. It is open late so makes a great last stop, and around sunset is an ideal time to do the ride if the weather is pleasant.\nYou can save money (and time) by purchasing your tickets in advance. Online prices are usually much lower than if you buy at the ticket desk.\nYou can buy tickets for the London Eye from the official site\nhere\n. We also have a complete\nguide to visiting the London Eye here\n.\nAlternatively,\nif you didn\u2019t do a boat trip on the Thames already, you might consider booking an evening sunset and/or dinner Thames river cruise. There are several companies that offer these in London, including City Cruises mentioned earlier and\nBateaux London\n.\nLondon Itinerary Day 3 \u2013 More London Highlights\nToday we are going to explore even more of London\u2019s central highlights, including the British Museum, Covent Garden, St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, and Shakespeare\u2019s Globe.\nToday all of the attractions are within walking distance but you may want to use public transit to reach some of them. It may also be a good day to use a hop-on hop-off bus if you have a free ticket with the London Pass as the bus routes go to or near all the attractions on today\u2019s route.\nClick\nhere\nor on the map below for a closer look:\nBritish Museum\nThe\nBritish Museum\nis a museum holding a vast collection of artifacts from cultures around the world, ancient to modern. Established in 1753 with the collection of just one man, it has grown to be one of the largest and most comprehensive collections in the world with about 8 million objects in its permanent collection!\nIf you are going to only visit one general museum in London, this would probably be my recommendation as it holds a wealth of treasures from mummies to vases, with the Rosetta Stone, Parthenon sculptures, and Lewis Chessmen being some of its most well-known treasures.\nNow you can walk (about 15 minutes) or jump on public transportation to get to Covent Garden and the London Transport Museum.\nLewis Chessmen\nLondon Transport Museum\nThe\nLondon Transport Museum\n(fee*) is a museum dedicated to telling the story of London\u2019s transport system over the last 200 years, highlighting the link between transport and the growth of modern London culture and society. The museum collection is housed in a 19th century building that was previously used for the Covent Garden Flower Market.\nAs a visitor you can follow a self-guided path that begins with what transportation was like around 1800 in London and then continues to the present day. So you get to see everything from human carried sedan chairs to horse-drawn omnibuses to steam trains to the famous red double-decker buses. The museum does a good job of having a mix of information and interactive exhibits.\nCovent Garden\nCovent Garden is a popular tourist destination in London. It originally was a food market (mainly fruit and vegetables) and by the 18th century had become a bit seedy and was also a popular red-light district. The food market eventually outgrew the space and was moved in the 1970\u2019s and today the area is home to shops, cafes, pubs, two markets selling crafts, jewelry, souvenirs, and goods.\nIt is a popular spot for street entertainers, and you\u2019ll often find crowds of people gathered around an entertainer here. The area has long served as an area of entertainment and the first known\nPunch and Judy\nlike puppet show in England was performed here in 1662! An easy area to find a bite to eat if you are hungry as there are dozens of bars and restaurants here.\nNow you can walk on to St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral (20-25 minutes) or take public transit.\nSt Paul\u2019s Cathedral\nSt Paul\u2019s Cathedral\n(fee*) is an Anglican church designed by Sir Christopher Wren in the English Baroque style. The present church was consecrated in 1697; however, it sits on the same site as the former medieval church of the same name which was badly damaged by fire. Today it is the seat of the Bishop of London and one of the most important churches in London.\nThe Cathedral was the tallest building in London for almost 200 years, and although no longer the tallest it can still be seen from many places in London and is one of the most recognizable places on the city skyline.\nThe Cathedral has been the site of many famous services and events, including the state funerals of Lord Nelson and Winston Churchill, jubilee celebrations for both Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II, and royal weddings such as that of Prince Charles to Princess Diana.\nSt. Paul\u2019s Cathedral was a symbol of resilience during WW2 as images of the recognizable Dome still standing after the Blitz gave hope to people (although the church was damaged), and Churchill would give orders to try to protect the church at all costs. Services were held here after both WW1 and WW2 to give thanks for their end and to pray for peace.\nAdmission prices include an audioguide for self-guided visits or you can join a regular guided tour of the church. St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral is a busy tourist attraction so be sure to allot enough time, especially if you want to climb the steps to the dome which can have a long line.\nIf you are planning to visit without a London Pass, especially in the summer months, we recommend booking your\nticket online\nin advance to save money on admission and to get skip the line access.\nWorshippers attending a church service or wanting to pray in one of the side chapels can enter for free.\nAn\nAlternative\nor additional stop in the area may be the\nMuseum of London\n, which is a great free museum dedicated to the history of London.\nTate Modern\nNow you can cross the Millennium Bridge, a popular pedestrian bridge, to reach the\nTate Modern\n,\u00a0the largest international modern art gallery in the UK. The museum\u2019s location is unusual as it is based in a former power station building. The museum displays\u00a0both a permanent collection as well as several temporary exhibitions throughout the year.\nPersonally I prefer the Tate Britain (also in London) since I tend to like older art, but this is a must-see for modern and contemporary art lovers and has some great masterpieces. The museum is free to visit.\nShakespeare\u2019s Globe\nA short walk away you\u2019ll come to a famous white theater building. First let me say that the current\nShakespeare\u2019s Globe\ntheater (fee*) is not the original and in fact this one only dates to 1997! The original Globe Theatre was built in 1599, destroyed by fire in 1613, rebuilt in 1614, and then demolished in 1644.\nThe current one is a realistic reconstruction of the original (with concessions to modern health and safety requirements) and is located very close to the site of the original. The man behind the rebuilding of the Globe is the late American actor and director\nSam Wanamaker\n, who sadly died before the Globe was completed.\nThe complex also has a museum exhibition about Shakespeare\u2019s work and the original theater, a smaller candle-lit indoor theatre called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, and an educational and rehearsal space. Today the public can visit the exhibition and take a guided tour of the theater, which allows visitors to experience what it would have been like to go to a theater in the Elizabethan era as either a lord or lady or as a poor groundling.\nYou can also get tickets for performances at both the Globe (summer only) and the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse (year-round).\nEnjoy a West End Show or Hit a Club\nTonight is a perfect evening to go see a West End Show performance, a performance in Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, or other theater or concert event. London is full of nightlife throughout the year\u00e2\u0080\u0094concerts, shows, theater, opera, circuses, comedy shows\u00e2\u0080\u0094so you shouldn\u2019t have a problem finding something that will appeal.\nIf you are planning to go to a theater performance, you can book tickets in advance online before your trip (recommended if there is a performance you really want to see) or try to find a deal once you are in the city.\nHere are some\ntips for buying London theatre tickets\n. Note that London Pass users typically have access to\ntheater ticket discounts\non certain West End shows. Also check out what is happening at the\nRoyal Albert Hall\nduring your visit, this world-famous venue hosts everything from classical concerts to rock bands to tennis matches!\nIf you prefer a club or a bar to a theater, London has some of the best clubs in Europe. Here is a list of some of\nLondon\u2019s top clubs\nto get you started. Note that most bars stop serving drinks between 11am and 2am, and here is a guide to some of London\u2019s\nlate night bars\n.\nLondon Itinerary Day 4 \u2013 Day excursion & Camden\nIf you have 6 days in London, I would head out of central London for at least one day. Today I\u2019d recommend visiting one of the major attractions outside the city in the morning and then spending the afternoon in the borough of Camden. Camden is well-known for its markets, canals, zoo, and Regent\u2019s Park.\nAlternatively, if you are not interested in visiting Camden, you could try visiting two of the recommended morning attractions (e.g., Windsor Castle and Kew Gardens). You\u2019ll need to use public transit to reach the morning attractions and to get to Camden but the attractions in Camden are all within walking distance.\nClick\nhere\nor on the maps (you\u2019ll need to zoom in to see the Camden sites) below for a closer look:\nVisit an Out of Central London Attraction\nIn the morning I\u2019d recommend heading to one attraction on the outskirts of London or just outside the city. All of these are popular and busy attractions so getting there around opening time is wise idea! Here are our top recommendations to choose from:\nOption 1: Windsor Castle\nWindsor Castle\n(fee*) was built as a defensive fortification by William the Conqueror in the 11th century. Today it is the largest and longest continuously occupied royal residence in the world. Much of the castle\u2019s magnificent State Rooms were designed and built in the 19th century, and the castle is a common weekend home for King Charles III.\nHighlights here include the State Apartments, Queen Mary\u2019s Dolls\u2019 House, and the 15th-century\u00a0St. George\u2019s Chapel. You can also see the Changing of the Guards ceremony here on certain days which is a similar but much smaller version of the ceremony that takes place in front of Buckingham Palace.\nThere is an excellent audioguide included with admission and you can also join offered guided tours at the castle. Note that the castle can get very busy, especially in the summer, so try to arrive at opening time or alternatively you may want to visit in the afternoon.\nTo get here you need to take a train out of London. You cannot use an Oyster Card and will need to buy a rail ticket, which\nyou can do here\n. Windsor Castle tickets can also be\npurchased here\n.\nWindsor Castle\nOption 2: Hampton Court Palace\nHampton Court Palace\n(fee*) is a former royal palace, originally built in the 16th century for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, a powerful person during the time of King Henry VIII. However, Wolsey would fall out of favor with the king (as most people did) and Henry would confiscate his house and use it as his own palace.\nThe huge Tudor and Baroque style royal palace was used by British monarchs until the 18th century and is now a popular tourist destination. The palace is huge and you could spend all day exploring its many rooms, but luckily the self-guided tours are broken up by themes so you can decide which parts of the palace are of most interest to you.\nThe gardens, the tennis court, and hedge maze are also definitely worth exploring here.\nThis is a must-see for anyone interested in King Henry VIII and Tudor history. The palace is located in outer London and can be reached by public transportation. Tickets can be bought in advance\nhere\n.\nOption 3: Kew Gardens\nKew Gardens\n(fee*) is considered one of the best botanical gardens in the world, housing over 8 million specimens. The gardens have \u201cthe largest and most diverse botanical and mycological collections in the world\u201d, representing \u201cover 95% of known flowering plant genera and more than 60% of known fungal genera\u201d!\nSome highlights include the Palm House, Temperate House, Waterlily House, and Treetop walkway. A trip here offers more than just plants, as you can also visit art galleries, the Great Pagoda, and tour Kew Palace, a former royal residence located within the gardens.\nYou can explore at your own pace or join one of the garden\u2019s guided walk tours that come free with entry. This is a must-see for any garden lover. Kew Gardens are located in outer London and can be reached by public transportation. Tickets can be bought in advance\nhere\n.\nKew Gardens\nOption 4: Warner Brothers Studio Tour London \u2013 The Making of Harry Potter\nIf you are a Harry Potter fan you might want to consider spending the morning at the Warner Brothers Studio located just outside the city. This film studio was where all eight of the Harry Potter films were actually filmed, and they have retained many of the original sets, clothing, and props from the movies.\nOn the largely self-guided\nThe Making of Harry Potter tour\n(fee), you can visit the Great Hall, the railway station, numerous filming locations from inside Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest, and Diagon Alley. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn many of the secrets of how the films were made, have the opportunity to drink Butterbeer, and explore giant gift shops full of all things Harry Potter.\nMany people take 3.5 to 4 hours to visit here. So you\u2019ll want to take this into account in planning your day as well as the time it will take you get there. This will be a full day trip for some.\nT\no get to the Studio, you can take a National Rail train (London Euston most convenient) to the Watford Junction station and then you can take the studio tour shuttle from the station to the film studios. The shuttle is included with your Studio Tour ticket.\nYou must book your tickets in advance online and have the voucher with you on your visit.\nYou can also\nbook a tour\nfrom central London that will take you directly to and from the studio so you don\u2019t have to take the train and shuttle.\nCheck out our detailed\nguide to the Harry Potter Studio Tour\nfor more information, tips, and photos.\nDiagon Alley\nExplore Camden\nAfter a morning spent exploring a royal palace, marveling at Hogwarts\u2019 Great Hall, or wandering around one of the world\u2019s best botanical gardens, you might want to head to the borough of Camden.\nCamden is a diverse neighborhood that has been home to a number of famous people over the centuries from Charles Dickens to Sigmund Freud to Amy Winehouse.\nOnce an industrial area known for shipping gin, it is now known for its markets, music scene, street art, and alternative fashion stores. It is also home to Regent\u2019s Park and the London Zoo, and\nCamden Lock is a popular place to start a canal boat ride along the Regent\u2019s Canal.\nView of Regent\u2019s Canal from Camden Lock Market\nCamden Market\nCamden Market\nis not a single market, but consists of several different markets within walking distance of each other. Market stalls sell just about everything including food, clothing, crafts, art, souvenirs, and more.\nIn addition to the market stalls, you\u2019ll also find restaurants, bars, dance clubs, and other entertainment spaces here. It is a popular tourist destination as well as a meet-up spot for Londoners. Although the Camden Market is open daily, you\u2019ll find it at its busiest and with the most open stalls on the weekends. Great place to find something to eat.\nLondon Zoo\nThe\nZSL London Zoo\n(fee*) is the world\u2019s oldest scientific zoo and it was originally begun with a royal collection of animals that has been previously kept at the Tower of London. Today the zoo animals include lions, hippos, otters, gorillas, tigers, and giraffes. The newest exhibition is the Land of Lions which features a large interactive exhibit for its endangered Asiatic lions.\nThe London Zoo also has a Reptile House, an aquarium, an aviary, and a large collection of insects. There are several places to eat, shop, and you can even take a photography workshop or spend the night in the zoo.\nThe Regent\u2019s Park\nThe Regent\u2019s Park\nis a large 410 acre royal park that is mainly open parkland. In the northern end you\u2019ll find the London Zoo, but you\u2019ll also find lots of open spaces, gardens, sporting pitches and facilities, children\u2019s playgrounds, sculptures, memorials, and an open air theater. You can also rent a boat to row across its lake (seasonal), climb Primrose Hill for a nice view of London, or enjoy the roses at Queen Mary Gardens.\nThere are also homes located in Regent\u2019s Park, including Winfeld House, which has been the official residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the UK since after World War 2. A great place to have a break or enjoy a picnic (there is a restaurant located in the center of the park or bring your own food).\nMadame Tussauds\nIf you still have time and energy, you can cross Regent\u2019s Park\u2019s (by foot or bus) and you can visit Madame Tussauds.\nMadame Tussauds\n(fee*) is a museum displaying the waxworks of famous and historic people from Tudor royalty to current Hollywood film stars.\nThe museum was started by an interesting French woman\nMarie Tussaud\nwho traveled around Europe with her wax figure collection until opening a permanent location in 1835. Although many of the original figures have been destroyed or damaged by fire or bombing, some of Tussaud\u2019s original figures still exist as well as older ones she inherited.\nThe oldest existing figure displayed in the collection is one modeled after Madame du Barry dating from 1765, but the museum also includes everyone from Queen Elizabeth II to the band One Direction to Angelina Jolie.\nAlthough not for everyone, it is a popular place to take a selfie with your favorite stars. The museum has become a popular London attraction and there are now branches of Madame Tussauds around the world, but if you are only going to visit one, I\u2019d visit the original! See our\nguide to visiting Madame Tussauds\nfor more information.\nAlternative\nplaces you may want to visit in the area include the\nSherlock Holmes Museum\n(fee) and\u00a0the\nJewish Museum\n(fee). Note that if you are a fan of Amy Winehouse, you\u2019ll find a\nAmy Winehouse statue\nnear the Stables Market, street art dedicated to her memory throughout the area, and there was an exhibition at the Jewish Museum about her life and career when we last visited.\nAmy Winehouse street art\nLondon Itinerary Day 5 \u2013 Kensington\nToday I\u2019d suggest exploring the London borough of Kensington & Chelsea, with a particular focus on South Kensington. This affluent area of the city is full of museums, galleries, stores, and world-class entertainment venues. Everything on the main itinerary is within walking distance (or a short public transit ride if you prefer).\nClick\nhere\nor on map below for location details:\nKensington Palace\nKensington Palace\n(fee*) is a royal residence set in\u00a0Kensington Gardens. It began as a fairly humble 17th century two-storey\u00a0Jacobean\u00a0mansion and was expanded by the royal family into the giant royal residence it is today.\nThe palace might be best associated with Queen Victoria as it was here that she spent much of her unhappy childhood and first learned that she was queen. More recently it was the official residence of Prince Charles (prior to his becoming King), Princess Diana, and their two sons.\nToday it is still an official private residence and workplace for many royals including Prince William and Prince Harry, but the State Rooms are open to the public. There is a lot to see here and it can be a bit confusing to try to wander around on your own, but luckily the palace has put together several different self-guided routes based on different themes and people (e.g., King\u2019s Apartments, Queen Victoria, royal fashion) to help you get the most of your visit.\nThere is a cafe here and the garden is a nice place to enjoy a cup of tea if the weather is pleasant.\nThis palace can be very busy, especially in the summer months or when they have a popular exhibition.\nIf you don\u2019t have a London Pass I would recommend\nbooking your ticket in advance here\nand if you do have a London Pass, I\u2019d recommend arriving near opening time.\nKensington Gardens\nAfter visiting Kensnigton Palace, if the weather is nice, I\u2019d spend some time exploring\nKensington Gardens\nand adjacent Hyde Park. Within this large green space, you\u2019ll find a number of gardens, sporting area, statues, biking trails, and boat rentals (seasonal).\nSome of the notable places to see or visit include the Serpentine Gallery, Serpentine Sackler Gallery, the Princess Diana Memorial, Peter Pan statue, the Elfin Oak, and the ornate Albert Memorial. An easy place to spend an hour or two.\nRoyal Albert Hall\nThe\nRoyal Albert Hall\nis a world-class performance venue that was opened in 1871 by Queen Victoria. The hall has hosted just about every kind of event which have included concerts by Richard Wagner, wartime speeches by Winston Churchill, rock concerts by the Beatles, tennis tournaments,\u00a0Cirque du Soleil performances,\u00a0and Star Wars films accompanied by a live symphony orchestra.\nIt has been host to the\nBBC Proms\nfor decades. If you are interested in going inside, you can take a guided tour of the Royal Albert Hall (fee*). Guided tours include the original carriage entrance, the auditorium, gallery, royal private box, and the private suites of the royal family.\nIf you\u2019d rather come for a performance, you can head inside to the Ticket Office. Note if you are on a small budget, inexpensive standing room only tickets are available for some performances, including the BBC Proms.\nKensington Museums\nIt\u2019s museum time! Kensington is one of our favorite areas for museums as it has loads of them, and the best part is that almost all of them are free to visit! Let\u2019s talk about the three main museums, and you can choose your favorite or dive into all three.\nFirst you have The\nScience Museum\nwhich has information and exhibits on a range of scientific topics from genetics and electricity to space travel and virtual reality. There are loads of interactive exhibits that are both fun and educational. The museum also has an IMAX theater (fee*).\nNext you have the\nNatural History Museum\nand its giant life and earth science specimens are housed in a beautiful building that looks more like a cathedral than a museum. Its collection holds over 80 million items and you can see everything from dinosaur skeletons to specimens collected by Charles Darwin to a giant mineral collection. There is also a seasonal butterfly house (fee) at the museum.\nThe\nVictoria & Albert Museum\n, often referred to as the V&A Museum, is the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest museum of decorative arts and design, with over 2 million objects in its collection that spans 5,000 years of human history! You\u2019ll find everything from Greek pillars to Chinese vases to Alexander McQueen gowns here. The museum is also known for hosting popular temporary exhibitions (fee) throughout the year.\nShopping\nKensington is well-known as a shopping destination with many of its most famous stores located along Kensington High Street, Brompton Road, King\u2019s Road, and Sloane Street.\nAmong the hundreds of stores, you\u2019ll find popular antique stores, the British department store Harvey Nichols, and the world-famous Harrods with its 1 million square feet of retail space which sells everything from specialty food to designer shoes!\nHarrods was started by Charles Henry Harrods as a small family-run shop, but like many British landmark institutions it is sadly now owned by foreign corporations (in this case the state of Qatar). In addition to shopping, you might also want to stop for an afternoon tea, such as this\nfashion inspired afternoon tea\nin Knightsbridge.\nIf you prefer a market, the Portobello Road Market in Chelsea is a popular market and at its best on Saturdays. There are many cafes and restaurants in this area if you are here at dinner time.\nAlternatives\n: There are many other things to see in the area (mostly in Chelsea), including the\nChelsea Physic Garden\n(fee*),\nLeighton House Museum\n(fee),\nDesign Museum\n(fee*), Portobello Road Market,\nChelsea Football Club Stadium Tour & Museum\n(fee*), and the recently renovated\nNational Army Museum\n(fee*).\nLondon Itinerary Day 6 \u2013 Greenwich or Free Day\nFor your final day in London, consider spending the day in the London borough of Greenwich. Greenwich is world-famous as the traditional location of the\u00a0Prime Meridian and for its observatory, but it also has a number of historical buildings, museums, a market, a giant park, and a famous tea clipper.\nA large portion of Greenwich, and most of today\u2019s suggested itinerary, is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as Maritime Greenwich.\nOr alternatively leave this day free to wander around London\u2019s streets and parks, do some shopping, or catch up on places you missed on prior days. Maybe you want to simply spend a day relaxing by the Thames, exploring the latest art exhibits, buying gifts for loved ones back home, or checking out vintage clothing shops.\nThis is also a perfect day to follow your specific interests and passions, whether it is searching for\nHarry Potter in London\n, checking out London\u2019s best pubs, visiting\nWinston Churchill sites\n, taking a\nJack the Ripper tour\n, checking off\nLondon\u2019s World Heritage sites\n, exploring London\u2019s street art, or finding the perfect fish & chips shop.\nClick\nhere\nor on map below for Greenwich location details:\nCutty Sark\nThe\nCutty Sark\n(fee*) is a British clipper ship built in Scotland on the River Clyde in 1869. The ship is historically significant for being one of the last tea clipper ships ever built and one of the last clipper ships of this period still in existence. The ship was originally used to carry tea from China to England as quickly as possible and would visit almost every major world port during its life at sea.\nIn later years as steam-powered ships became popular, the Cutty Sark was used for cargo transport and then as a training ship. It was dry docked here in 1954 and is now one of the area\u2019s most popular tourist attractions.\nA tour of the Cutty Sark allows you to see the ship\u2019s interior, learn about the ship\u2019s history and what it was like at sea in Victorian times, hear stories of the people on board the ship, and see the ship\u2019s hull up close as you walk underneath it. There is also a cafe on board where you can grab sandwiches or have afternoon tea (if you want a full afternoon tea, book it in advance).\nTickets can be purchased in advance\nhere\n.\nOld Royal Naval College\nThe\nOld Royal Naval College\nis a set of buildings designed by Christopher Wren whose original purpose was to serve as a place to care for and house retired seamen. Later the large building complex was used as a naval training college and today is used for a number of functions, and many of the buildings are open to the public.\nWe\u2019d recommend starting your visit at the Greenwich Visitor Centre which has some helpful information, displays, and artifacts. Then you can wander around the site to admire the buildings, and you can visit the Chapel and the beautiful Painted Hall, painted by James Thornhill\u00a0in the early 18th century. Guided tours can also sometimes be arranged for those with a special interest to see more areas of the complex not usually open to the public.\nBefore the Old Royal Naval College was built, the Palace of Placentia (better known as Greenwich Palace) sat here which was the birthplace of King Henry VIII and his daughters and later queens Mary I and Elizabeth I. You can learn more about it in the Greenwich Visitor Centre.\nNational Maritime Museum\nThe\nNational Maritime Museum\nis a great museum dedicated to the dramatic maritime history of Britain. The museum covers about everything related to the sea from shipping and trading, fishing, technology development, the Atlantic Slave trade, pirates and explorers, war battles at sea, leisure cruises, and the life of seamen throughout the ages. You\u2019ll even find J.M.W. Turners\u2019 largest painting\nThe Battle of Trafalgar\nhere.\nThe museum is packed with information, exhibits, and fun interactive bits. The museum is free to visit.\nNot far away you can also visit the\nQueen\u2019s House\n, a beautiful and architecturally significant former royal residence designed by Inigo Jones.\nAdmiral Nelson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trafalgar coat\nGreenwich Park\nGreenwich Park is yet another of the large royal parks in London that was once a royal hunting park. Here in its 183 green acres,you\u2019ll find a number of attractions, historical ruins, memorials, sporting fields, a deer park, and gardens.\nOur favorites are the rose garden, the\nRanger\u2019s House\nwhich houses the Wernher Collection of art, and the Royal Observatory Greenwich. Note that the hill in the park is a bit steep but those who climb the hill are also rewarded by a nice view of London.\nGreenwich Park\nRoyal Observatory Greenwich\nThe\nRoyal Observatory Greenwich\n(fee*) is a well-known observatory that has played a significant role in the history of astronomy and navigation. It is known as the location of the prime meridian and gave its name to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and sits first on the meridian line.\nThe observatory is now maintained as a museum and visitors can learn about the history and discoveries at the observatory, stand on the famous Meridian line, visit Flamsteed House, see a camera obscura, and see the great equatorial telescope.\nAdmission includes an audioguide to make the most of your self-guided visit. You can buy your tickets in advance\nhere\n.\nNearby is the interactive\nAstronomy Centre\n(free to visit) and the attached Peter Harrison Planetarium (fee), which is currently London\u2019s only planetarium.\nGreenwich Market\nGreenwich Market\nhas been in existence since the 18th century and is one of London\u2019s best covered markets. The market sells food, clothing, flowers, antiques, crafts, souvenirs, art, and more. There are also a number of pubs and restaurants nearby. A great area to grab a snack or meal.\nIsle of Dogs\nIf you are looking for a walk underneath the River Thames, you can take a walk across the Greenwich Foot Tunnel to the Isle of Dogs. The\nIsle of Dogs\nis surrounded by the Thames on three sides and while once na industrial dock area, it is mainly a residential area now. The view from the Island Gardens across the river of the Queen\u2019s House and Greenwich Hospital was depicted by Canaletto in a few of his paintings.\nFrom here you can walk back across the tunnel to Greenwich or take public transit onto your destination.\nNote that if you haven\u2019t done a Thames cruise yet and still want to, you can pick up a boat at the Greenwich Pier near the Greenwich foot tunnel entrance.\nFinal Night Out?\nIf you haven\u2019t already taken in a West End Show or gone out for some of London\u2019s nightlife, this is your last chance to do it. If you are looking for an earlier evening (big flight tomorrow?), consider splurging on a nice dinner to enjoy your final evening in London and talk about all the great things you saw and did during your 6 days in London!\nSave Money on your 6 Days in London Trip with the London Pass\nWe wanted to give you an example of the cost savings over 6 days in London if you have a London Pass.\nThe following is based on the above itinerary although it doesn\u2019t include every single attraction we suggested but includes what we believe is a realistic number for someone planning to actively sightsee based on the above itinerary.\nNote, we have included images of the London Pass which was previously available as a physical product. As of 2021, the pass is only available as virtual product, which can be used through a smartphone app. The code can also be printed out for scanning.\nHere is the cost savings for 6 days in London for 2 people with the\nLondon Pass\nbased on our itinerary above:\nLondon Pass Savings Calculations\nAttractions\nNormal Entry Cost\n(July 2024 Prices)\nHOHO Sightseeing Bus\n\u00c2\u00a337 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a374\nWestminster Abbey\n\u00c2\u00a329 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a358\nHOHO Thames Boat\n\u00c2\u00a324.6 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a349.2\nTower of London\n\u00c2\u00a334.8 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a369.6\nSt Paul\u2019s Cathedral\n\u00c2\u00a325 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a350\nShakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre\n\u00c2\u00a327 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a354\nLondon Eye\n\u00c2\u00a345 x 2 = \u00c2\u00a390\nKensington Palace\n\u00c2\u00a324 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a348\nGuards Museum\n\u00c2\u00a38 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a316\nHousehold Cavalry Museum\n\u00c2\u00a310 x 2 = \u00c2\u00a320\nJewel Tower\n\u00c2\u00a39.5 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a319\nTower Bridge Exhibition\n\u00c2\u00a313.4 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a326.8\nLondon Transport Museum\n\u00c2\u00a324.5 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a349\nWindsor Castle\n\u00c2\u00a333 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a366\nZSL London Zoo\n\u00c2\u00a341.8 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a383.6\nCanal Boat Ride\n\u00c2\u00a318 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a336\nScience Museum IMAX film\n\u00c2\u00a312 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a324\nRoyal Albert Hall\n\u00c2\u00a317.5 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a335\nCutty Sark\n\u00c2\u00a320 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a340\nRoyal Observatory Greenwich\n\u00c2\u00a320 X 2 = \u00c2\u00a340\nTotal Cost Without Pass for Two Adults\n\u00c2\u00a31022.2\nTotal Cost of two 6 day passes\n\u00c2\u00a3478\nTotal Savings with Passes\n\u00c2\u00a3544.2\nIt\u2019s also always worth comparing prices between the\nofficial site here\nand\nGetYourGuide here\nas sometimes one will be better value than the other.\nAs you can see in our example (with the 6 day pass) we ended up with a\nsavings of \u00c2\u00a3272.1 per person\nfor a total cost savings of \u00c2\u00a3544.2. This is definitely a considerable amount for six days of sightseeing!\nEven if we had visited significantly fewer sites during the six days in London, we would have still saved money with the London Pass. A general rule is that you need to visit an average of 2 to 3 attractions per day to save money with a 6 day London Pass.\nWe highly recommend that all visitors check out the London Pass, especially if it is your first visit to London. It covers free entry to over 80 attractions and museums, plus a number of discounts on tours, restaurants, souvenirs, and theater tickets. Not only will it save many visitors money, it also saves times by providing fast track entry into certain busy sites.\nHowever it is not a great fit for everyone, and if you are not sure if it is a good fit or not, read our\nfull review of the London Pass\nto help you decide as it breaks down the features, ways to purchase, how to calculate your cost savings, and more.\nThere you have our suggested London itinerary on how to spend 6 days in London.

Glad you had such a great stay and hope you have a chance to return to London again.\nHappy travels!\nJessica\nReply\nI just bought my airline tickets last Tuesday for travel the last week of September .  I am traveling solo and now I need to start making  the rest of my plans. This article has been incredibly helpful as London is a large city and I am overwhelmed!   I am subscribed to your newsletter and look forward to gathering more information.   Thank you for all the effort you put into this article and all the resources provided!\nReply\nHi Alexis,\nThanks so much for taking the time to comment and let us know that our London article has been helpul. Obviously, I would suggest editing the London itinerary to best suit your interests, pace, etc. but hopefully it will give you some good ideas on what you might want to see/do and how to organize your days. If you have any questions as you begin to book the rest of your trip, just ask!\nBest,\nJessica\nReply\nOur group of 4 adults is planning a 5-day trip to London in late April to early May. We\u2019ve been struggling over how best to allocate our time in the city. Your post\u2019s itineraries are a wonderful resource for us! Thank you for all the work you\u2019ve put into it!\nReply\nHi Coleen,\nYou\u2019re very welcome and glad our London itinerary ideas have been helpful in planning your Spring trip. If you have any questions as you plan your trip, feel free to just ask!\nWishing you a wonderful trip to London!\nBest,\nJessica\nReply\nThis is how detailed and comprehensive a guide should be! Thanks for this, Jessica! Hoping to read more itineraries from your trips.\nReply\nHi Tom,\nThank you very much for your nice comment, and glad you are enjoying our London itinerary. It is a city we have spent a lot of time in. We do have other itineraries on our travel blogs (we also run Finding the Universe) that might be helpful for future trips elsewhere.\nWishing you a wonderful trip to London!\nBest,\nJessica\nReply\nThanks for mentioning your other blog site, I found the Cost of Travel in Uk blog very helpful. Anyway, since you\u2019ve been or spent a lot in London, what do you think of private tours with GowithGuide, is it worth it?  in terms of travel with family of DIY itinerary is still doable regardless of number of people traveling in London?\nReply\nHi Tom,\nI don\u2019t have any specific thoughts about GowithGuide and haven\u2019t used this site for a private tour. But if you do hire a guide for a private tour in London, I\u2019d recommend a licensed Blue Badge guide as they tend to be the best (and are the only people who can guide within certain places). If traveling with kids, it is best to find a tour guide who specifically does family tours as some of the guides can pack too much in or plan tours that aren\u2019t very interesting to kids/teens. And yes, guides are normally able to do a set itinerary of their suggestions or you just pay them by the hour (plus all transport/entrance fees) to do a DIY itinerary that you decide in advance with your guide. So definitely good to ask all your questions before booking if planning to hire a private guide.\nA private guide is definitely going to add a lot of extra cost to your trip, so I would think about if you feel you need one or not. London is a pretty easy city to see independently if you speak English so you definitely do not need one. So it just depends on if you think it would be worth the cost or not. Certainly a good guide can be priceless, especially if you have an interest in learning more about the history and backgrounds of the places you are visiting and for local recommendations.\nWe tend to just join tours within sites (e.g., tour the Parliament) and to do general city walking tours (e.g., an introduction to London tour or a Jack the Ripper tour). These are generally not that expensive as they are group tours and are generally 2-4 hours in length. Some are led by site guides (e.g., Parliament) or companies like\nTake Walks\n, City Wonders, or Context Travel.\nAnyway, hope that helps!\nBest,\nJessica\nReply\nHi Jessica, thank you for your input! I\u2019ll take your suggestions/recommendations into consideration. Thanks a lot!\nOne of the most comprehensive guides to London that I have recently seen is this one. I\u2019ve been to a good number of these sights, but there are still a ton left to see.\nReply\nThanks Babu for taking the time to comment. Glad you have enjoyed so many great places in London but this itinerary inspired you to visit still more places. I don\u2019t think you can ever fully see a bit city like London \u2013 always something more to see or do \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0089\nBest,\nJessica\nReply\nMost a wonderful and informative site. We would also like to see a day of countryside out of London, what would you recommend.  I day we have a trip to Paris.\nReply\nHi Saras,\nGlad you are finding our suggested London itinerary helpful in planning your trip. There are lots of countryside locations all around southern England so you will have no shortage of choices. But it really depends on what you want to do there, do you want to just see the countryside, do you want to go hiking, or some other activity? Do you want to go on a guided tour or do you want to take the train out to a location and explore on your own? Some locations might be the Cotswolds for pretty villages and countryside or Kent which has lots of countryside walks.\nFor example,\nthis guided tour\ntakes in a number of popular Cotswolds villages and includes a lot of driving through local countryside. This is a very beautiful part of the country and near where we live.\nIf you are a fan of \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d, the Highclere Castle tours may be of interest as those tours include filming locations that are set in the Cotswolds countryside. Many of the tours also include a visit to a historical farm. Just note that the home is only open a limited number of days a year so it would depend on the dates of your visit. But you can see our\nHighclere Castle guide\nfor more information on visiting.\nIf you are looking for a more of a day of hiking on your own, you could consider a hike in lots of places like the Cotswolds (perhaps a section of the Cotswolds Way), Kent (lots of countryside walks), or do a short section of the Thames Path (this long-distance path runs alongside the river and goes through London). You would just need to figure out where you want to hike and plan your transport to and from there.\nFor the\nThames Path\n, you can combine a popular attraction visit with hiking as places like Hampton Court Palace and Windsor Castle are along the path. So you could get train or bus from London to Hampton Count Palace for instance, visit the palace and then do a afternoon hike from there along the river and then return back. If you\u2019d rather bike than hike, there are also biking tours\nlike this one to Hampton Court\nthat you can join.\nThose are just a few ideas, but there is a lot of potential countryside locations that may suit depending on what you want to do.\nHope that helps, and just let me know if you have further questions!\nBest,\nJessica\nReply\nThank you so much for this serious and well-thought-out list! I\u2019m on my way here second time and I can see I have a lot of catching up to do. I want to add that for anyone considering a longer stay, it is worth checking out the co-living option. I had a flat here last time and loved it.\nReply\nHi Mike,\nGlad that our London itinerary is helpful in planning your second visit to London. Yes, if you are staying for several day or more, it can often save you money and be easier to rent a flat than pay for a hotel, just depends how you like to travel and what amenities you need.\nWe have a guide to\nbooking holiday homes and flats in the UK\nhere that gives you some of the best booking websites if you are searching for one!\nBest,\nJessica\nReply\nGreat itinerary. I used to live in London and haven\u2019t done nearly all of these! I love Greenwich and its market, and always has a pie and mash at a great little cafe there \u2013 not been south of the river for a while now but must take our daughter up to London to explore before too long.\nReply\nHi Polly,\nYes, we love Greenwich \u2013 it is a great place to spend a day! Hope you get a chance to visit London with your daughter soon.\nBest,\nJessica\nReply\nHello,\nSo happy to find this! I goofed on calendar dates and booked Harry Potter 1st on our trip instead of the walking tour you suggest. We arrive in June on a Sat late. Booked Harry Potter for Monday not knowing there is no changing of the guard on Tuesday for the tour. And it looks like no tours are booked on Sundays. What do you recommend we do 1st Sunday? Pretty much want to see all you mention in your itinerary, I guess I\u2019m just out of order. 1st time visitor to the UK. Thank you!\nReply\nHi Victoria,\nDon\u2019t worry, you can do the days in really any order, so I would just book any tours on the days that work best for you and for what\u2019s happening (such as the changing of the guard). You can leave your Harry Potter tour as is or switch it to a better day, but I would not be too worried about the order. But yes, you do need to check opening hours/days and schedules for the attractions you really want to visit. For instance, I think Westminster Abbey is also closed on Sundays for public visits (services only).\nFor the Changing of the Guard, if you are interested in seeing it as part of one of the walking tours, I\u2019d just join the tour on a day the changing of the guard is scheduled to happen. Just note that weather and royal events can affect the ceremony as well, so just keep that in mind. But I\u2019d just do the Westminster highlights on that day, in however it fits into your schedule. If the tour doesn\u2019t work into your schedule, you can of course just head over on your own to see the Changing of the Guard, just be sure to try to get to the palace well before it starts so you can find a place to stand.\nFor Sunday, I think Kensington would be a good area to explore. There is the palace, the parks and gardens, Royal Albert Hall, several free museums, and lots of shopping opportunities in that area. So you have lots of choices of how to structure your day. As far as I can think of (but do double check all the places you definitely want to visit), all the main attractions are usually open on Sundays. Just note that Sunday is generally going to be a busier day for museums and attractions as you have all the local people off work and it is a day a lot of families go out \u2013 but this is going to be true of any place in London (especially free places).\nIf you are planning on using a London Pass (or other tourist pass), it is only valid for a set number of consecutive days. So I would just make sure you go to the things included on your pass within the allocated number of days once you activate the pass.\nThe other thing to note is that we list a lot of options and alternatives for each day of our London itinerary, and it is designed to help give you an area to explore each day and a suggested route. You can\u2019t of course visit all the places (especially if you want to really go inside and spend time) we mention under each day and do all the extra tours and activities we mention. So I\u2019d use each day as a guide for the area you are visiting and the major attractions, and then focus on all the places that are must-sees, whether you want to really visit each place or just view it from the outside (and how long you think the visit will take), and then make a list for \u201cother things that I\u2019d like to see here if there is time\u201d. This can really help prioritize your days, especially if you encounter delays or you decide to spend longer than expected somewhere.\nHope that helps, and just let me know if you have any other questions as you plan your trip to the UK!\nBest,\nJessica\nReply\nYour suggestions have been so helpful.  We area going to London next month!  We hope to see some of the Christmas markets while we are there.  I am not sure if I missed it, but how long per day (approximately) from start to finish to fit in the itinerary?  We generally like to move at a leisurely pace and so I would want to make some adjustments if it is a little overwhelming for us.  Thanks again for all your ideas!  Helen\nReply\nHi Helen,\nHappy to hear our itinerary is helpful! Our London itinerary is just a general suggestion for how you could spend 6 days in London. We discuss more attractions than you\u2019d want to squeeze into each day to give you choices. So I\u2019d use it more to base each day. The days are laid out to give you a good roadmap but you\u2019ll want to adjust as needed. I\u2019d take into account which attractions are of interest and for those you want to visit, how long you\u2019d want to spend at each (taking into account security and lines).\nFor example, for Day 1 describes a walking route focused on Westminster, joining together a number of historical and popular attractions and sights. You could complete the general sightseeing path in an hour or so on foot, but then you want to add in time for each attraction you want to stop and visit, breaks, meals, etc. Some people may want to just spend a few minutes seeing Westminster Abbey from the outside and then move on and others will want to go inside and spend a couple of hours touring it, so it is really dependent on the traveler. If as part of the walk, you want to visit Westminster Abbey (for an estimated 1.5 hours), stop for lunch (for estimated 1 hour), visit the National Gallery (for an estimated 2 hours), and stop in to see the Banqueting Hall (estimated 40 minutes) as part of the route, that would fill up most of your day.\nOur itineraries are definitely designed for a full day of sightseeing (after breakfast to dinner), so yes I would definitely adjust down for a more leisurely day out. And take into account other things you want to do such as the Christmas markets. For example you may want to try to take out a day out of the itinerary and try to do 5 of the days over 6 days.\nHope that helps!\nJessica\nReply\nHi,\nCan I check if this London itinerary is recommended for summer? I\u2019m going in Nov/Dec and I was told the days are shorter.\nThanks.\nReply\nHi BK,\nOur London itinerary will work any time of the year and just about all the places mentioned are opened year-round. Our 6 day London itinerary is a suggestion though and you\u2019ll want to edit it to your specific schedule and preferences.\nThe daylight hours will, of course, be shorter in London in the winter months than in the summer months. Also some of the attraction opening hours may be a bit shorter than in the summer months. So you may not be able to see or do quite as much as you could in the summer months. Our 6 day London itinerary provides lots of suggestions for each day, and you can still use it to guide each day. But you will probably want to maybe aim for no more than 3 major attractions (to go inside) each day.\nHope that helps,\nJessica\nReply\nThanks for such a great article! I\u2019ll be in London next month for the first time in my life and you\u2019ve been of great help. I\u2019ve been reading about the London Pass, and they offer some interesting excursions on their app, but the problem is I haven\u2019t been able to find their price. Could you help me? Thanks in advance!\nReply\nHi Luciana, Glad you are finding our London itinerary helpful. I am not 100% sure which excursions you are referring to but London Pass holders do get discounted prices on some tours outside of London, and you can view these and their prices and book them\nhere\n. Hope that helps! Best, Jessica\nReply\nThank you for the amazing 6-day London Itinerary! My husband, two adult daughters and I will be visiting London for 7 days in September (13th \u2013 19th) for the first time. We\u2019ve been doing a lot of research and have put together a tentative itinerary. I do have a couple questions I hope you can answer. Is it wise to visit Westminster Abbey at opening time one day and the Tower of London first thing on another day? Do you think the queues will be long that time of year? Is there a way to buy a ticket or book a tour to avoid the queues? It looks like I can buy a ticket on the Westminster Abbey website for a particular day and time block (9:30-11:30 am) so assume it\u2019s not a timed entry and will wait for entrance. It looks like the Tower Of London tickets don\u2019t offer a timed entry either. Thanks for any advice you can provide.\nReply\nHi Patty, Yes, Tower of London in particular we recommend visiting when it first opens as it doesn\u2019t absorb crowds that well in certain areas such as the line to see the Crown Jewels which can get busy and long. We were the first group in on our last visit and didn\u2019t have any long waits. Westminster Abbey is also always busy but does absorb crowds better, but can be good to visit near opening if it fits in your schedule. Kensington Palace is another site in London that is best to try to visit near opening if it is on your list.\nLondon is a popular and busy destination year round but September is not going to be nearly as busy as July and August so attractions will be busy but should not be super busy. We normally visit with the London Pass so we just try to arrive near opening for busiest places and then visit less busy places later in the day.\nYes, Westminster Abbey does offer fast-track entry tickets (only sold by them online) for most days and times. We have not used these but you get to avoid the ticket lines and I think you should be able to go through a faster security line. But you may want to send them an email or call them to confirm this. The tickets are sold by time blocks so you just need to be in line before that time period ends to use your ticket.\nFor the Tower of London, you can currently pre-purchase tickets online for entry to avoid the ticket line but I don\u2019t think it gets you into a priority line.\nIf you you are interested in a walking tour (and all 4 of you are reasonably fit), this\ntour by Take Walks\nis a great one to consider. It is organized in a way so that you see as much as possible in one day and includes tours of both of the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey as well as Changing of the Guard ceremony and more. One great advantage is the guide is a Blue Badge guide so can do tours inside both attractions. So that might be something to consider for your first or second full day in London.\nHope that helps!\nJessica\nReply\nExcellent itinerary!! My wife and I will be visiting for 8-days in August and have secured lodging near Madame Tussaud\u2019s and Regent\u2019s Park. We have already received our Visitor Oyster Card and selected this location due to it\u2019s close proximity to a couple of underground lines. Is this a suitable location, in your opinion?? I am using your itinerary as a baseline and filling in with specific markets, for dining and a walking tour or two to dig a little deeper into some history and culture. On day 7 we are going up to Highgate Cemetery with Take Walks \u2026 Can\u2019t wait!! Thank you for the excellent post!!\nReply\nHi there, Yes, I think that as long as you are somewhat central and near a good public transit line, you should be able to easily do a lot of sightseeing in London. Regents Park is a nice area, and there are two Underground stations really close together there (Baker Street and Regent\u2019s Park). You are just a 15 to 20 minute Tube ride from the very center of the city so it should not take you too long to reach any of the places in our 6 day London itinerary except of course if you head out to Kew Gardens, Windsor, etc.\nThe Highgate Cemetery tour sounds interesting, that must be new to Take Walks, we\u2019ll have to check it out!\nWishing you a great visit to London,\nJessica\nReply\nDid you stay in the same hotel for the 6 days or did you book different hotels according to your itinerary?\nThank you\nReply\nHi Beverly, We would recommend staying in the same hotel, which is why we recommend a centrally located hotel so you are closer to most of London\u2019s attractions. But you could split up in stay in 2 places if you really wanted to do so of course, but I\u2019d probably recommend just one place if you can so you don\u2019t have pack up and move hotels in the middle of your visit. Best, Jessica\nReply\nHi Jessica,\nThank you so much for the 6 day itinerary. I have a couple of questions I hope you could answer. Do you know if the airbnb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment in London have a safe box to put personal belongings in to? And are there any budget hotels in London that can accommodate a family of 4? My wife and I travel with our sons who are 17 and 18.\nDanny\nReply\nHi Danny,\nGlad you are finding our London itinerary helpful!\nIf you are thinking of an Airbnb in London (note we have personally NOT had good experiences in London with budget Airbnbs), most Airbnbs do not have a guest safe. But I am sure some do, but you will likely need to contact properties individually to ask if they offer a safe as it is not a feature you can currently search for and this as it is not often included in the descriptions. It is not typical if renting an Airbnb apartment. If having a safe is important, I\u2019d recommend looking at budget hotels or apartment hotels instead as they are much more likely to have a safe box in the room.\nYes, most budget hotels can accommodate 4 persons. Most room configurations though are going to be 2 double beds, so if your sons are OK with sharing that could work for 1 room. Or try to find a family room that has 1 double and 2 singles or 2 doubles with a pull-out sofa. Otherwise, I\u2019d probably recommend getting 2 separate rooms, one for you and your wife and one for your sons. You can search for rooms for 4 adults\nhere on Booking.com\n.\nHope that helps, let me know if you have further questions.\nBest,\nJessica\nReply\nThank you so much for you help.\nDanny\nReply\nI had stayed just 3 nights in Westminster, and it was totally enough to love that city. On my last day, I just tried to see something negative, but no way.. It might be only some expensive when you compare it with other European cities, I guess.\nAnd, this post\u2026 It looks like a formal guide, more than a blog content. Thank you\u2026\nReply\nHi Melis, Yes, it is easy to love London, and we love staying in or near Westminster or elsewhere in central London. It is a great time for new visitors to the city as it makes it easy to walk to so many of the highlights like the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, and Buckingham Palace! Glad to hear that you didn\u2019t have anything negative to say about your stay, and hope you return to see more of what London has to offer! Best, Jessica\nReply\nSo much helpful advice here\u2026thankyou!  Re London Pass or London Explorer Pass\u2026the former has a maximum 10 day pass whereas Explorer gives you 30 days, which is great for us.  We will have 10 days in London and may want to vegetate a bit in between serious sightseeing!! Value your thoughts on this\u2026am I missing something here? ( apart from different venues depending on your interests)\nReply\nHi Kathy, In terms of time the London Explore Pass may be good if you have more than 10 days in London and want to explore the attractions at any time during your visit. However, the London Pass gives you free entry to a lot more attractions (60+) than the\nLondon Explorer Pass\nwhich only allows you to visit up to 7 attractions (out of 20) plus sightseeing bus for 1 day. That included attractions are also different between the two.\nI think the main thing to consider is what attractions do you know you want to visit? Then see if the London Explorer Pass is a good fit and includes those. If not, the 10 day London Pass may be a better fit.\nHope that helps!\nJessica\nReply\nThanks heaps Jessica! I\u2019ve since been checking reviews and London Explorer Pass doesn\u2019t seem to be a good option\u2026.not recognised at some venues etc. etc  When 80% of reviews aren\u2019t favourable I think it pays to steer clear!\nReply\nHi Kathy, The London Explorer Pass is sold by the same company as the London Pass, but it is just a different product. I haven\u2019t heard anything negative about it (it should work as designed) but it works differently from the London Pass. I think the bad reviews are likely by people who did not know how it worked. It will definitely save you money if the attractions included fit where you want to visit. But if you are not sure, the London Pass gives you a much wider range of attractions to choose from and you can visit as many as you want during the consecutive day period. Hope that helps! Jessica\nReply\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting to London at 6:30 in the morning on a Sunday after a long flight. Do you have recommendations on what to see without having advance tickets on that day?  With possible delays/exhaustion I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid of booking activities in advance for our arrival day.  Thank you for any help.\nReply\nHi Allison, If your flight arrives at 6:30am, you should have a lot of time that first day. But since you\u2019ll likely be tired, I\u2019d just plan a relaxing day. You have a lot of options and really could pick stuff from any of the days of the 6 day itinerary.\nI would recommend having a London Pass and then perhaps doing the suggested walking route around Westminster as described in Day 1 \u2013 you can stop into the attractions that look interesting and you have time to visit. Most don\u2019t require reservations and most are free to enter with the London Pass.  A few places in London do close to visitors on Sunday, notably Westminster Abbey, so do keep that in mind. Then whatever you don\u2019t see the first day, you can just go back and visit the next day.\nAnother option would be going to go to Kensington and explore the museums, parks, and shops around that area at your leisure. Or maybe you just want to tackle one big place, like spending the day at Hampton Court Palace, Windsor Castle, or exploring the British Museum.\nThis is also maybe a good day to do a sightseeing bus as you can get your bearings while justing relaxing on a bus. Or do a Thames boat cruise.\nAnyway, hope that helps!\nBest,\nJessica\nReply\nHi, i am travelling to London and bought 6 Days london pass. Am so confuse where to start as my hubby will hv interview on Day 2 of our arrival. Intervirw is at Birdcage walk near Westminster. I would also like to visit Paris as i will be thete in London for 10days. Staying at relative place at southfield. Much appreciate if u could guide on the best itinerary. First time traveller from malaysia\nReply\nHi Michelle,\nI think that the 6 Day London itinerary above should work well for you, but you should do the days as they make sense with your schedule and not necessarily do them in order. So for the day you are in Westminster, Day 1 is a good one to follow. Most attractions in our itinerary are included on the London Pass.\nSouthfields is not very central or near many tourist attractions, except Wimbledon, so just keep that in mind as you will need to take public transit each day to get to each of the neighborhoods we recommend in our itinerary. So plan in that extra time. Your relatives should be able to tell you the nearest Underground and bus stops and the best ways to use public transit from where you will be located.\nSince you have 10 days, I\u2019d consider doing at least a couple of day trips out of London. We recommend several at the top of this article to places like Stonehenge, Oxford, Stratford-upon-Avon, etc.\nParis can be visited as a day trip or you can take the Eurostar train and stay overnight in Paris and then return to London, depending on your schedule and budget. You can also book a tour from London to Paris, and you can see options\nhere\nand\nhere\n.\nHope that helps, let us know if you have further questions as you plan your trip to London.\nBest,\nJessica\nReply\nAdmiring the persistence you put into your travel blog and in depth information you provide.

Just wanted to know which month did you travel in? I plan to travel to London in November, will the tourist spots mentioned in your post be open then?\nReply\nHi Vidhi, Yes, almost all major attractions (and even most minor ones) are open year-round in London. Buckingham Palace for instance is only open for part of the summer, but all the rest should be open. However, many may have reduced winter hours so just check the website of the attraction before you visit to note the opening days and times. Wishing you a great trip to London! Best, Jessica\nReply\nWow, we are going to London in 2 months and this is the most helpful post I\u2019ve come across over the past week in searching for things to do during our time in London. This London itinerary covers all of the things we had on our bucketlist plus so many other great places and tips on how to spend our time. My husband and I are very grateful and we\u2019ll be printing this out and bring it along our our trip!! Our warm thanks from NYC!\nReply\nHi Amy & Scott, So happy to hear and thanks for taking the time to comment! Wishing you a fantastic visit to London and please just let us know if you have any questions about our London itinerary or traveling in London. Best, Jessica\nReply\nWow! This is a really fabulous detailed guide to things to do in London! We\u2019ve hit London from time to time over the years for a couple of nights here and a couple of nights there \u2014 before or after a cruise. We\u2019ve enjoyed the double-decker, hop-on/hop-off sightseeing bus for an overview of the city. And oh the musicals and plays! That\u2019s our favorite thing to do in London \u2014 take in a West End show.\nYou\u2019ve got us thinking that next time we should explore the Camden area. :-).\nReply\nHi guys, Thanks! Yes, a bus tour or walking tour is always a great way to get a good feel and look around a new city! The West End is definitely a great area for those who like theater and musicals!! Camden is a great area of London to explore if you haven\u2019t been before, there are of course the famous markets and London Zoo, but you can take canal boat rides, visit Jewish Museum, do street art tours, wander Regent\u2019s Park, etc. It is definitely an area with a different vibe! Best, Jessica\nReply\nWhat an amazing itinerary which will surely stop me walking around in awe and keep me in the right direction. We like to fit as much as we can in our days as it is so far to travel we make the very most of our time. Thanks for keeping all this info in one place so we can save for a reference when we finally make it to UK.\nReply\nHi Lyn, You should still leave some time to walk around in awe \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0089 Westminster and the City of London have the biggest concentration of the iconic sites and are great areas to hit in your first few days in London. Hope you get to the UK soon and hopefully this London itinerary will come in handy! Best, Jessica\nReply\nVery good itinerary, Jessica. We\u2019ve spent a week in London some years ago and visited all these places (except for the Royal Albert Hall), but I loved revisiting them with you through your beautiful post and pictures. We also bought the London Pass, like you, and saved a lot of money. For us it was worth it.\nReply\nHi Anda, Thanks, glad you like our suggested itinerary on how to spend 6 days in London. Happy to hear that you saved a lot of money from buying a London Pass. Best, Jessica\nReply\nWhat an amazing and detailed itinerary for London! I\u2019m pinning it now for later planning. I love how you included alternatives in it. My favorite is Warner Bros. Studios and the Harry Potter set. I\u2019m a self professed Potterhead (nerd, but I\u2019m good with it lol). This post has definitely moved London up some notches on my travel bucket list and made it seem more affordable with the right planning.\nReply\nHi Cheryl,  Glad you enjoyed our 6 days in London itinerary. We just went to the Warner Brothers Studios the Making of Harry Potter tour this year and really enjoyed it. We are not huge Harry Potter fans but still spent almost 3 hours doing the tour and stopping for a snack and butter beer \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0089 You might enjoy Laurence\u2019s guide to\nHarry Potter spots in London\nand my guide to\nHarry Potter sites in Edinburgh\nfor future trips! Best, Jessica\nReply\nJessica, you knocked it out of the park! Well, you always do but this time you hit the ball a bit harder.  I visited London once but my time there was so, so reduced.  I have come to the realization that London needs time (like other great cities in the world).  I like to have 3 or 4 days in a city but I think that will never be enough in London.  I will like to have at least a week in the city.  And, I will love to follow parts of your itinerary.  I am the one always looking for walking maps!\nReply\nHi Ruth, Thanks for the kind words! Yes, I agree, 3 or 4 days is not enough time in London as it is in many cities. Some cities like London, Paris, NYC, etc. just need a lot more time as they just have so many great sites, attractions, and entertainment options. We think 5 or 6 days in London is a good amount of time to see a lot on a first trip without getting overwhelmed or exhausted. I hope you get a chance to return soon and do parts of this London itinerary and use the suggested walking maps \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0089  Jessica\nReply\nAmazing list of things to do in London! We\u2019ve already done many of them, but many are definite repeats if you ask me! My boys and I plan to spend 2 weeks in London over the Christmas Holidays, and will definitely refer back to this list for inspiration!\nReply\nHi Hilary, Yes, we often return to places we love as well. We\u2019ll be back in London in November and already have plans to re-visit a couple of the galleries \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0089 Enjoy your upcoming trip to London. Best, Jessica\nReply\nThis is an excellent post on London. We spent 4 days there in April and covered quite a bit, but would love to go back so have pinned your post for reference. Your photo of the Beefeater at the Tower is spectacular!\nReply\nHi Paul & Carole, Thanks, and I hope you get a chance to visit London again. There is so much to do in the city that it is difficult to see everything you want in one (or two!) trips \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0089 Thanks, Laurence shot that at the Tower our first trip to London together a couple of years ago \u2013 we had a gray rainy day and that was the best shot of the day! Best, Jessica\nReply\nI just love how thorough and detailed your posts always are! Definitely a great resource for anyone planning to visit London. Even though I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in London, I haven\u2019t visited all the places on your list \u2013 especially the Greenwich area, or even St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, which is actually pretty close to my apartment. Pinned this for when I go back to London later this year!\nReply\nHi Michelle, St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral is a great church, I didn\u2019t find it as historically interesting as Westminster Abbey but it has a lot of history and significance and is definitely a symbol of London. The dome was definitely a highlight for Laurence, although I would recommend trying to go early to avoid it being too crowded as the line for the dome can get long and is slow moving. Greenwich has loads of great things to do, we spent a couple of days exploring Greenwich on our last trip and Laurence\u2019s brother is actually moving there next year so should get to see even more \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0089 Definitely recommend going the next time you are in London, lots of stuff to do including museums, the Cutty Sark, historical buildings, the O2 arena, family-friendly things, and a giant park. Best, Jessica\nReply\nThis is a one of the most detailed guides to London I have seen for a long time. I have been to quite a few of these, but there\u2019s still so many to visit.\nReply\nHi Upeksha, I am not sure if you could ever see everything in London, and I think that makes it one of those cities that is great to keep visiting. We are excited to head back again in a few months! Best, Jessica\nReply\nI\u2019ve done soooo much in all of my many visits to London, but at the same time there is still sooo much to see and do! I can\u2019t believe you managed it all in 6 days! That London Pass definitely seems like it\u2019s worth the splurge! Pinned!\nReply\nHi Lolo, Yes, the London Pass can be a great deal as even though it may seem like a lot upfront, the cost of many of the attractions in London are \u00c2\u00a315 to \u00c2\u00a320 each. We did not actually do this exact itinerary in a single 6 day trip, but it is based on our many visits to London. This is what we came up with for the best itinerary for first or second time visitors. One should definitely go at their own pace and adjust our suggested London itinerary each day to meet their needs. Best, Jessica\nReply\nexcellent post! and it\u2019s great to see other people also doing a lot on a trip, visiting actual sights not just trendy things they saw on Instagram or Pinterest:) I shuddered when I saw some of the prices, I was fortunate to have done most of these on my trips to London before a couple of years, the prices are sky high  now! Can you believe that I paid only 12 pounds for Tower of London? but then again,it was 10 years ago. luckily, there are many free attractions in London, and once you\u2019ve visited all the main attractions you can do the rest:) I did Sky garden last year for instance:) and Tower Bridge exhibition but only because they didn\u2019t have the glass walkaway before:)\nReply\nHi Tanja, We like to really explore cities and we\u2019ve been to London now a number of times so have seen most of the major attractions and many of the lesser known ones, although we always discover something new on each visit. Yes, 10 years ago prices were definitely lower and there seems to be a small increase in attraction entry fees every year or two. Although its not just London as we have observed in the same in Paris, NYC, SF, etc. London does indeed have some great free attractions, I love the parks, shopping arcades, and free museums. Best, Jessica\nReply\nWow you really covered a lot and I can tell a lot of thought went into this post (like usual!).  I have been to a lot of these but there are some I still need to visit, like the Churchill War rooms.  I had no idea that you could save so much using the London pass, that is a great tip.\nReply\nHi Anisa, The Churchill War Rooms are fantastic (well in my opinion!) and the museum is very centrally located (short 5-7 minute walk from Westminster Abbey or Parliament Square). Most people go to see the secret bunker and war rooms and learn about how it operated during WW2, but my favorite part is the Churchill Museum which is a giant room filled with all kind of Churchill artifacts, memorabilia, and information. The London Pass includes free entry into about 60 attractions in London (e.g., Churchill War Rooms, Westminster Abbey, London Zoo, Tower of London) and can really save many visitors money as most are going to want to visit some of the included attractions. Best, Jessica\nReply\nGuys,\nGreat post, you\u2019ve managed to cover so many sides of London in six days, with so much detail.  I love the city. However, I am biased as I\u2019m a Londoner, it says so on my Birth Certificate.\nYou\u2019ve captured a brilliant mix of history, culture \u2013 London\u2019s green spaces, museums and galleries.  Glad you included Camden & Greenwich because both offer another side of London.\nI have to agree the best way to see London is on foot \u2013 there\u2019s so much to see, or bus if the feet are weary  (The river cruise is also a good idea).  I\u2019d say avoid the underground unless it\u2019s a distance (Smartphones & maps help here) because there\u2019s always something to see when heading from A to B.\nAs I said, fabulously detailed post, and will help a visitor see a chunk of London.\nHappy Travels,\nGary\nReply\nHi Gary, Glad that we have the seal of a approval of a Londoner!! Laurence lived in the city for a few years but honestly didn\u2019t make it to many tourist sites during that time, so it has been fun exploring them together when in the city. We get a lot of readers asking for these longer itineraries so finally put one together! Yes, exploring London by foot is a lot of fun as you never know what you\u2019ll see and cutting across green spaces is so nice as it gives you a bit of time to relax!!

The Big Smoke. It\u2019s a sprawling city, covering over 600 square miles and home to almost nine million people. It\u2019s also one of the most popular destinations in the world.\nWhile referred to in the singular, London is actually a collection of cities. The City of London (aka \u201cThe City\u201d) is just 1.1 square miles (and the site of old Roman settlement Londinium). What we think of as London today is actually other cities (Westminster, Camden, etc.) that \u201cThe City\u201d gobbled up over the years. (Fun fact: The West and East Ends of London are so named because they were outside the ancient wall that enclosed London.)\nMy\nlike\nfor London turned into\nlove\non a visit several years ago. Maybe it was the beautiful weather that stood in stark contrast to my other visits, maybe it was the people who I suddenly felt bonded with, maybe it was all the good restaurants and bars I found. Maybe it just took a decade of visits for the city to just \u201cclick\u201d with me. Maybe it was all of it. I don\u2019t know.\nBut now\nit\u2019s one of my favorite cities in the world.\nWith so much to see and do, planning a trip to London can be overwhelming. Where should you stay? How should you plan your days? What day trips are worth doing?\nTo help you make the most of your visit, have fun, and save money, here is my detailed itinerary for visiting London.\nLondon Itinerary\nDay 1\n:\nWalking tour, Parks, Soho, & more!\nDay 2\n:\nBritish Museum, National Gallery, & more!\nDay 3\n:\nBuckingham Palace, War Rooms, & more!\nDay 4\n:\nNatural History Museum, Jack the Ripper tour, & more!\nDay 5\n:\nArt galleries, Tower of London, & more!\nDay 6 & 7\n:\nBath, Oxford, Stonehenge, & more!\nWhat to See and Do in London: Day 1\nTake a Free Walking Tour\nStart your first day off with a free walking tour to orient yourself and learn about the history of London. They are the best way to get situated on arrival and get some tips from a local guide (you can ask the guide for suggestions about what to see and where to eat during your visit).\nNew Europe\nand\nTours By Foot\nboth offer tours that can show you the highlights and help you get your bearings. Just remember to tip your guide at the end!\nIf you\u2019d prefer a more detailed and in-depth tour, check out\nWalks\n. They offer all kinds of cool tours around the city, including an\nearly-access guided tour of the crown jewels\n. I always take a Walks tour when I visit. They\u2019re that good.\nFor more walking tour suggestions, here\u2019s a list of\nthe best walking tour companies in London.\nExplore New Neighborhoods\nLondon is a great city to explore on foot. You can follow the ancient Roman wall (part of the wall still exists and so does an old Roman amphitheater, which was rediscovered in the 1980s) from the Tower of London through the center of the city. The city maintains a series of panels about the wall and the history of the city along the way.\nVisit London has a free app\nthat lets you create personalized maps and itineraries that you can use offline as well.\nFor in-depth paid tours that take you around specific neighborhoods, check out tour marketplace\nGet Your Guide\n. It\u2019s where local operators can list their tours, so there are a ton of different tours for all interests and budgets, including a\nstreet art walking tour\naround East London and a\nHarry Potter tour\naround central London.\nRelax in a Park\nAfter all that walking on the first day, chill out in any one of the city\u2019s many parks. Some of my favorites include:\nSt. James\u2019 Park (Westminster)\nGreen Park (Westminster/Central London)\nRegent\u2019s Park (Camden Town)\nKensington Gardens (Kensington)\nHyde Park (Central London)\nHolland Park (Holland Park)\nBattersea Park (Battersea)\nI like to pack up some food, bring a book, and just relax and watch the world go by. It\u2019s what the locals do \u2014 and you should too!\nHang in Soho\nI love Soho. It has cute little parks, world-class restaurants, lots of popular bars, funky bookstores, beautiful buildings, and everything in between. I recommend you spend your evening (or many evenings) here eating and drinking and hanging out with the locals. Some recommended places include:\nCeviche Soho\n\u2013 Great Peruvian food.\n17 Frith Street.\nFlat Iron\n\u2013 Simple menu featuring steak and salad and a daily special.\n17 Beak Street.\nLa Bodega Negra\n\u2013 Amazing Mexican food.\n16 Moor Street.\nEat Tokyo\n\u2013 Delicious ramen.\n16 Old Compton Street.\nMr. Foggs\n\u2013 The best gin London can offer!\nSeveral differently themed locations.\nThe Three Greyhounds\n\u2013 A fun traditional pub. Fun story: I ended up drinking with Rami Malek from Mr. Robot! He was nice.\n25 Greek Street.\nWhat to See and Do in London: Day 2\nMuseum Hop\nTake advantage of London\u2019s incredible museums and overload on history, art, weird oddities, and everything in between. Some of them are so big you can barely see them in a week, let alone a day. Here are some of the best ones to start with:\nBritish Museum\n\u2013 By far one of the best museums in all of Europe, this giant museum houses one of the most comprehensive art, cultural, and historical collections in the world. Be sure to budget at least three hours to get a good sense of the museum, though you could easily spend a whole day there.\nGreat Russell St, +44 20 7323 8299, britishmuseum.org. Open daily 10am-5pm (8:30pm on Fridays). Admission is free but they recommend booking tickets in advance .\nNational Gallery\n\u2013 This art museum was founded in 1824 and houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to around 1900. There are works by Johannes Vermeer, Sandro Botticelli, Rembrandt, and Michelangelo, among many more! It\u2019s a really extensive and wonderful art museum.\nTrafalgar Square,  +44 20 7747 2885, nationalgallery.org.uk. Open daily 10am-6pm (9pm on Fridays). Admission is free but they recommend booking tickets in advance. An\nofficial guided tour of the museum\u2019s highlights\nis 19 GBP.\nNational Portrait Gallery\n\u2013 Here you\u2019ll find portraits of famous Brits from over the centuries, from kings and queens to celebrities and artists.\nSt. Martin\u2019s Place, +44 20 7306 0055, npg.org.uk. Admission is free but donations are welcome. Open daily 10:30am-6pm (10:30-9pm on Fridays and Saturdays).\nWhat to See and Do in London: Day 3\nVisit Buckingham Palace\nStart off with a stroll through Hyde Park\u2019s lush and expansive grounds, with its picturesque walkways, ponds, and ducks, before heading to Buckingham Palace, the royal residence and administrative headquarters of the monarchy, to watch the changing of the guard at 10:45am. It lasts for about 45 minutes (arrive early to get the best view). Be sure to check the website first though as the changing of the guards doesn\u2019t happen daily (it\u2019s usually every other day).\nIf you\u2019re visiting during the summer, Buckingham Palace is open to the public. Booking online in advance is recommended. Tickets cost 32 GBP if you book in advance and 35 GBP on the day. You\u2019ll be able to explore the lavish State Rooms and see some of the crown\u2019s treasures. Expect to spend a couple of hours. Note that the State Rooms are only open for 10 weeks each summer (July 13th to September 25th in 2024).\nBook your tickets to the State Rooms in advance here.\nSee the Churchill War Rooms\nNext, meander over to the Churchill War Rooms. Located beneath the Treasury Building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, this includes the government\u2019s command center during World War II and a museum about the life of Winston Churchill, who served as Prime Minister of the UK from 1940-1945 and again from 1951-1955. The centerpiece of the whole place is an interactive table that enables visitors to access digitized material from the Churchill archives. It is one of the best museums in London.\nBook online in advance to avoid the multi-hour wait! Admission is 32 GBP. Open daily 9:30am-6pm.\nTour Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament\nAfterward, marvel at Westminster Abbey and Parliament. You can see the tombs of 17 monarchs dating back to Henry III (who died in 1272) in the Abbey. Other famous people buried here include Charles Darwin, Sir Issac Newton, Aphra Behn, and Charles Dickens. Westminster Abbey costs 29 GBP (\nbook online in advance here\n) but you can visit for free if you go during a service. Just be quiet and dress respectfully. Open 9:30am-3:30pm (last entry).\nOn Saturdays, you can tour the Parliament. This is where the UK government conducts its business. Tours last 75 minutes and include visits to the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and Westminster Hall. You\u2019ll learn about the history of the building (the first parliament was held in 1265), how the government was created, and how the UK political system functions. Amongst the ornate rooms, there are all kinds of artwork to admire, including statues of Nelson Mandela, Gandhi, and Winston Churchill.\nTours are 33 GBP and tickets can be booked online in advance. During July and August, tours are also offered Tuesday-Friday in addition to Saturdays.\nEat in Borough Market\nAfter that, hop on the tube from Westminster to London Bridge (or walk along the South Bank) and head to the famous Borough Market to grab a meal from one of the many vendors. It\u2019s hugely popular with locals, especially around lunchtime. The market here dates back to the 12th century while the building itself is from the 1850s. It\u2019s open daily 10am-5pm. Bring an appetite!\nWander South London\nAfter you\u2019ve satiated your hunger, wander around South London. See the site of the original Globe Theater (where Shakespeare put on his plays), visit the eerie Crossbones Cemetery that honors the working girls and lost souls of London, walk along the riverfront, marvel at Millennium Bridge, and pop into the Tate Modern for a few hours to take in some of the best modern art London has to offer (it\u2019s free).\nThen head back toward Borough Market for a drink at the George Inn, one of London\u2019s oldest pubs and where Charles Dickens used to drink (it\u2019s also likely that William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe drank here). The new Globe Theater is also here if you want to take in a Shakespearean play (standing tickets can be found for as little as 5-10 GBP).\nPlanning a trip to Europe?\nGet all my best travel tips along with these guides:\nTravel Planning 101\n61 Savvy Travel Tips\nThe Best Hostels in Europe\nMy Favorite Travel Companies\nHow to Get Free Flights to Europe\nEnter your info below to get your\nFREE\nguides sent to you today!\nGet the free guide\nWhat to See and Do in London: Day 4\nVisit More Museums\nLondon is a museum city. It has some of the best in the world, so I suggest you visit a few more before you go:\nNatural History Museum\n\u2013 There are over 80 million items in this comprehensive museum, including specimens collected by Charles Darwin. It also has a great collection of fossils, making it a fun and educational stop if you\u2019re traveling with kids.\nCromwell Road, +44 20 7942 5000, nhm.ac.uk. Open Monday-Sunday from 10am-5:50pm (last entry at 5pm). Admission is free but you should pre-book your ticket online in advance.\nScience Museum\n\u2013 Founded in 1857, this is actually one of the most popular museums in London, attracting millions of visitors each year. There are some really neat interactive galleries on flight and space, and the temporary exhibitions are usually pretty amazing (though those often cost extra).\nExhibition Road, South Kensington, +44 20 7942 4000, sciencemuseum.org.uk. Open daily 10am-6pm. Admission is free but you should pre-book tickets online in advance as they cannot guarantee tickets at the door.\nVictoria and Albert Museum\n\u2013 Named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, this museum is home to over 2,000 works of art covering over 3,000 years of human history.\nCromwell Road, +44 20 7942 2000, vam.ac.uk. Open daily 10am-5:45pm (10pm on Fridays). Admission is free (temporary exhibits may charge a fee).\nEat on Brick Lane\nHead east to the famous Brick Lane and eat your heart out \u2014 it has some amazing Jewish delis (Beigel Bake is the most famous \u2014 and delicious) and Indian cuisine. On the weekends, this street becomes a bustling flea market and a hub of activity when it fills with antique and flea market sellers, food vendors, and people eating and drinking their way down the street.\nTake a Jack the Ripper tour\nJack the Ripper was a serial killer in London from 1888-1891 with at least 5 murders to his name. He\u2019s one of the most infamous killers in the world and every night, you\u2019ll find tons of people in the East End learning about Jack the Ripper on a ridiculous number of similar tours.\nMy favorite is the\noriginal Jack the Ripper Tour\n. Their guides are experts on the 19th-century murders and really bring this dark, gruesome topic to life. While dark, the tours are fun and informative, lasting just under two hours and costing 18 GBP. Check the website for times.\nWhat to See and Do in London: Day 5\nWander Trafalgar Square\nStroll around and admire the fountains and the famous monuments, such as the four bronze lion statues and Nelson\u2019s Column. The column honors Admiral Nelson\u2019s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The naval battle saw over 70 ships and 50,000 men battle for control of the seas, with the English defeating the combined forces of Spain and France. Lots of people hang out here so it makes for a good place to people-watch and takes in the local pace of life.\nExplore the Tower of London and See the Crown Jewels\nBuilt in 1070 by William the Conqueror to defend his royal power, the tower is actually a castle located on the north bank. The fortification was used as a prison and palace and was expanded many times over the centuries. Until the 1800s, weapons and armor were made here and all coins were made here until 1810 under the Royal Mint.\nToday, it houses the famous crown jewels (royal ceremonial objects, including coronation regalia). Admission is 34.80 GBP (\nbook your tickets online in advance here\n).\nThe Tower of London\u2019s changing of the guard (known as the Ceremony of the Keys) takes place daily at 9:30pm and is worth seeing. Tickets are free but must be pre-booked because it fills up quickly. Make sure and get there beforehand as they won\u2019t let anyone in after 9:25pm.\nBe sure to also head to nearby Tower Bridge, which opened in 1894 (and a lot of people confuse it with London Bridge). You can access the bridge deck to take in the view or check out the Tower Bridge Exhibition, where you can see the old Victorian engine rooms and get a sense of just how epic an engineering feat the bridge\u2019s construction actually was. Open daily 9:30am-6pm. Admission is 13.40  GBP.\nTake in a Show\nLondon is my second favorite theater spot after\nNew York City\n. You can\u2019t leave without seeing a show. Check out\nTKTS\nfor discounted tickets for shows in the West End. There\u2019s always something fun playing!\nWhat to See and Do in London: Days 6 & 7\nSee Stonehenge\nStonehenge, located near\nSalisbury\n, is one of the oldest man-made structures in the world (it dates back to 2500 BCE). You can\u2019t approach the stones anymore as they are now cordoned off, but it\u2019s still quite a fascinating site to explore. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, each stone weighs around 25 tons and stands around 4 meters (13 feet) tall. And because Stonehenge was built by a culture that didn\u2019t leave any written records, we still have no idea why they built it.\nThe audio guide is a must so you can get some historical context (it\u2019s free to download\nhere\n). Admission ranges from 22.70-27.20 GBP depending on the time of year and\nyou can book your tickets online here\n(though it\u2019s possible to legally visit without paying by taking the nearby pedestrian path).\nDay Trip to Bath\nBath\nis named after its famous mineral baths and is home to an\nancient Roman bath\nthat is marvellously well preserved.\nThe Romans settled here when they invaded Britain because of the hot springs that bubble up from the earth. The locals thought this place had spiritual significance, and when the Romans came, they felt the same and dedicated this site to Minerva, the goddess of wisdom. Despite being on the edge of the frontier, the city grew to become a major religious and cultural center. People came from all around to pray to Minerva and use the baths, which they believed had special healing powers.\nAdmission costs 27-29 GBP on weekends and 24.50-27 GBP on weekdays depending on the season. Audio guides are free. For a more detailed experience, take a guided walking tour around the city with\nFootprints Tours\n. You\u2019ll learn a ton about the city and have a much more in-depth experience before you explore the baths.\nDay Trip to Oxford\nOxford\nis home to one of the oldest universities in the world (it was founded in the 11th century as a hub for theological learning). Exploring all the beautiful colleges here makes for a fun day trip. The University is the main attraction here and Bodleian Libraries offers guided tours of the university, including the inside of many historic buildings. During the tour, you\u2019ll get a look at university life, the history of the school, the architecture, and more. You can take a 30-, 60-, or 90-minute tour, with costs ranging from 10-20 GBP.\nOther highlights include South Park, the Bridge of Sighs, the botanical gardens, and punting on the river (pushing a small boat around the River Thames or the River Cherwell with a pole).\nDay Trip to Cambridge\nCambridge\nis similar to Oxford with some of the best universities, parks, museums, and theatrical productions in the country. I enjoyed the museums, wandering around the parks, and embracing the relaxed pace of life (there are only around 125,000 people here compared to the almost 10 million in London!). Visit the colleges, stroll along the Backs, visit the Fitzwilliam Museum, or go punting.\nMost people visit for just the day; however, I recommend staying overnight. For such a small city, there\u2019s a lot to see and do here!\nTake Another Walking Tour\nDuring a recent visit to London, I tried out over 25 different walking tours. There are many amazing companies that have created some insightful, entertaining, and delicious walks for every type of interest. From Harry Potter walks to historic pub crawls, there will definitely be something for everyone. No matter your interests or budget, there is a tour for you.\nHere are some of my favorite walking tours in London\nto help you get inspired and plan your visit.\n***\nLondon\nis one of the biggest \u2014 and best \u2014 cities in the world, with a ton of things to see and do (I didn\u2019t even get to mentioning Camden, Notting Hill, and all the other neighborhoods!). It\u2019s easy to get lost in every neighborhood as you explore this bustling, exciting metropolis.\nAnd while a week in London barely scratches the surface, it is enough to get a good overview of the city, dive into its smaller neighborhoods, and experience the local history and culture. Use this London itinerary as a guide for your next trip and get a feel for why I love this city so much.

much to see and do, so is it really possible to cover it all in just 5 days? Don't worry, 'cause the answer is\nyes\n!\nPhoto credit: @fhanakoo\nThe capital city of the United Kingdom may have a lot to offer, so to make the most out of it, we've done our research and picked out the\nbest things to do\n,\ntop sights to see\nand\nmust-eats\nin the city. Especially if you're a first-time visitor to the city, this\n5-day London itinerary\nis made just for you! Keep reading to find out more. \ud83d\udc40\u2728\nComplete your London experience with these activities!\n5D4N London Itinerary\nDay 1: Soak in London's best sights at South Bank\n1. Hop-on hop off bus tour\nWelcome to London! Since it's your first day, why not explore the city with a\nhop-on hop-off bus tour\n? This is a popular travel mode for most first-time visitors in the city, as you'll get to see and drop by all of London's top attractions at your own pace. In fact, most of the places that we've included in Day 1's itinerary are also stops along the bus routes.\nWith the\n24-hour bus ticket that you can get from Klook\n, you'll get to enjoy unlimited access to the bus tour all-day long, as well as WiFi and an audio guide onboard. In summer and winter, there's even a\nnight bus tour\nthat you can go for in the evening instead, to escape the daytime heat.\nGet your 24 or 48-hour Hop-on Hop-off Bus Tour ticket here!\n2. Tower Bridge & Potters Fields Park\nPhoto credit: @sh.gwon\nStart your exploration with none other than London's most famous bridge, the iconic\nTower Bridge\n. Built across the River Thames in the 19th century to connect both the north and south banks of the city, the bridge is easily recognisable from afar with its two huge Gothic towers and blue ironwork. There's even a\n43-metre high glass walkway\nwhere you can enjoy stunning views of the city from the top of the bridge!\nPhoto credit: @joyfuladventuresuk\nYou can cross the bridge on foot, but it's definitely best admired from the riverbank. Our favourite spot to get the best view would be from\nPotters Fields Park\n. Located immediately southwest from the bridge, this park is a popular photo spot, but also as a picnic location!\nHead up to the Tower Bridge Exhibition in London!\n3. Brunch at Borough Market\nPhoto credit: @boroughmarket\nLondon is home to a vibrant street food scene, with a wide variety of markets and food halls for you to choose from, but the historic\nBorough Market\nis without a doubt one of our personal favourites. You'll be spoiled for choice with the endless options of food at this market, with restaurants, pubs and stalls offering decadent sweet treats and indulgent dishes from all around the world.\nNote\n: Borough Market is closed on Mondays, so be sure to plan for a visit on other days instead.\n4. The Shard\nPhoto credit: @yana_yushchenko\nJust a 5-minute walk away from Borough Market is\nThe Shard\n, once known as the London Bridge Tower. Standing 310 metres tall, this is the tallest building in the United Kingdom! It goes without saying that you'll get incomparable panoramic views of the city from up their observation deck, making it one of London's most popular attractions.\nPhoto credit: Jamie Street\nThere are also plenty of restaurants and bars in The Shard, many that offer window seats with amazing views, so you can even have your lunch here instead of Borough Market if you prefer!\n5. Tate Modern\nPhoto credit: @exploringwithmygirl\nPhoto credit: @exploringwithmygirl\nIf you're an art lover, do consider dropping by\nTate Modern\n! Inside, you'll be presented with innovative contemporary exhibitions and works of art by renowned modern artists of the world. In fact, it is the largest museum of modern art in the United Kingdom, with a permanent collection that includes works by Picasso and Warhol. The best part is that entry into the gallery and most of its exhibitions are free!\n6. The London Eye & Jubilee Gardens\nPhoto credit: @jaymicadacquil\nAs the sun sets on your first day in the city, why not take a ride up the majestic\nLondon Eye\n? Standing at 135-metres tall, this is Europe's tallest ferris wheel and definitely a fun way to enjoy 360-degree views of the London skyline and the River Thames. The whole experience will take about 30 minutes, and do remember to book your spot in advance!\nPhoto credit: @priscindrayadi\nSituated adjacent to the London Eye is the\nJubilee Gardens\n, where you'll get one of the best photo spots with the iconic ferris wheel in your background. This beautiful landscaped park is always abuzz with pop up events and food stalls, so if you decide not to head up the London Eye, we would recommend hanging out here instead in the evening.\nBook your slot and tickets for a ride up the London Eye here!\n7. Dinner at Waterloo\nThere's no better place for dinner than\nWaterloo\n, a busy district that is home to not only a shining theatre scene, but also to many dining options. We'll just name drop a few restaurants that you should definitely check out - the casual Crust Bros or Pizza Pilgrims for pizza, Rosa's Thai or Gogo Pocha if you're craving for Asian flavours, or The Archduke for a good steak.\nIf you've still got some extra energy for the rest of the night, we'd recommend exploring the vibrant nightlife scene here. From elegant rooftop bars to lively pubs, why not pay one or two of them a visit to end your first day in London?\nDay 2: Discover historical landmarks in Westminster\n1. Breakfast in Westminster\nPhoto credit: Ugur Akdemir\nThere's no way better to wake up in London than with an English big breakfast. Start your second day's journey from\nWestminster\n, where you can easily find staple British fare. Popular spots you can try include Regency Cafe, Cafe Nuvo, Bill's Victoria Restaurant or Astral Cafe, all of which serve full English breakfasts.\n2. Buckingham Palace\nPhoto credit: @zoehu_tw_insuomi\nPhoto credit: Hulki Okan Tabak\nA must-visit during your five days in London is none other than\nBuckingham Palace\n. All decked out in gold and boasting 775 rooms on the inside, you best believe that this royal residence will appear even grander in real life. For first-time visitors, don't miss out on the Changing of the Guard, one of the most recognisable ceremonies associated with the palace. The whole ceremony kicks off at 10.45, but we'd suggest getting here at least 20-30 minutes in advance to secure a good viewing spot, especially during the summertime.\nNote\n: The Changing of the Guard only takes place on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, so do plan your visit accordingly!\nWatch the changing of guards at Buckingham Palace!\n3. Westminster Abbey & Big Ben\nJust a 15-minute walk away from Buckingham Palace is\nWestminster Abbey\n.\nYou'd probably recognise the inside of this stunning gothic building - since almost a millennium ago, this has been the coronation church of the monarchs of England, and a stellar royal wedding venue. Go as early as you can as there will be long queues to enter, but going inside isn't completely necessary as you can already get stunning photos from the outside of the abbey due to its impressive architecture.\nGet your entry tickets for Westminster Abbey here!\nAfterwards, you should definitely snap a photo with one of London's most recognisable monuments, the\nBig Ben\n. Situated right in the heart of the city's historic centre, you'll find the famous tower with its 4 clock faces, standing proud at an impressive 96-metre height, and located inside it is the huge 13-ton bell that the name Big Ben belongs to.\n#KlookTip\n: Want a photo with the clock tower? Walk along the Great George Street/A302, where you'll find red phone booths that have become a popular location to capture the Big Ben in the background. Another option is to walk across the Westminster Bridge, where you'll eventually find nice spots to capture not only the tower, but also the Parliament and the River Thames in your photo's backdrop.\n4. Trafalgar Square\nPhoto credit: @meganxhan\nPhoto credit: @ain._.pf\nHead north towards\nTrafalgar Square\n, one of London's most important public squares. This lively area is always bustling with activity, be it with public celebrations, live street performances, or even demonstrations. At the centre of it all is its iconic fountains, massive lion statues and the monumental Nelson's column.\nIf you didn't manage to grab breakfast in the morning, there are also plenty of cafes and restaurants here at Trafalgar Square for you to grab lunch or a simple quick bite. Otherwise, you can simply sit back and just people-watch, or why not pay the National Gallery a visit?\n5. Hyde Park\nFancy a late afternoon stroll? Spanning across 350 acres, the massive\nHyde Park\nis a sprawling green space in London, and a refreshing reprieve from the busy city. As one of London's eight royal parks and also the largest, you can easily spend up to two hours simply just wandering around as you explore its wetlands, gardens, playgrounds, sports facilities, historical monuments, and more.\nIf you're travelling here in the wintertime, you're in luck! Pay the park a visit and you'd be delighted to find the exciting Winter Wonderland amusement park, the annual Christmas market, and even the largest ice rink in the UK, all of which are held here in the colder season.\n6. Kensington Gardens & Kensington Palace\nPhoto credit: @muslihainlondon\nBeyond Hyde Park's west end, you'll find yourself at another stunning park,\nKensington Gardens\n. It is also another one of London's royal parks, and takes up a space of 265 acres, with tons of green space for you to explore. Drop by the Serpentine Galleries for some art, take pictures of the Albert Memorial and Peter Pan Statue, or bring the little ones for playtime at the Diana Memorial Playground.\nPhoto credit: @__utsukushiiiii__\nThe massive park was once the private gardens of\nKensington Palace\n, which you would find nestled within. The palace is currently the official royal residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and their children, so you can expect nothing less than an impressive structure and lavish rooms housed within.\n7. Dinner in Kensington\nUpscale and packed with energy, the neighbourhood of\nKensington\nmay be known for its museums and lively shopping scene, but it also has plenty of cafes and restaurants for you to have your dinner at. Some of our favourite stops are Maggie Jones's, Dishoom, and Da Mario, but you can also check out Publiq or Stick & Bowl for more affordable options.\nDay 3: Revisit childhood memories in North London\n1. Breakfast at King's Cross\nPhoto credit: Andrei Ianovskii\nThere's going to be a bit of walking today, so start your day right with a hearty breakfast! Head to\nKing's Cross\n, where you can find many breakfast options in the area. You can never go wrong with a cup of coffee and a sandwich from Pret A Manger, but other spots in the area include Giraffe, Caravan King's Cross Restaurant, and Le Pain Quotidien.\nPhoto credit: Sarah Ehlers\nOpened in 1852, London's\nKing's Cross Station\nis\u00a0one of England's most important historic buildings, but it's also a famous stop for a whole other reason. If you're a Harry Potter fan, a visit to the iconic\nPlatform 9\u00be\nis a must! While the actual platform does not exist in real life, there's a makeshift Platform 9\u00be  on the wall in the station concourse for you to take photos at, and get yourself official merchandise at the Harry Potter Shop.\nInterested in a full day tour of Harry Potter filming locations instead?\nVisit Harry Potter filming locations in London with this tour!\n2. Camden Town\nSpend the rest of your morning and afternoon in\nCamden Town\n! This trendy neighbourhood is known for its massive market and an eclectic mix of great street food, gift and souvenir stops, a diverse selection of stores, as well as live music venues.\nA must-visit is the\nCamden Lock Market\n. With over a 1000 unique stores, stalls and dining outlets, this is probably the largest street\u00a0market that you can find\u00a0in the city. You can easily spend hours wandering around here, shopping for handcrafted items, vintage goods, clothing, accessories and more, as well as sampling all of the food. If you\u2019re hungry, there's a stretch of street food from all around the world along Regent's Canal.\n3. Regent's Park & London Zoo\nPhoto credit: @kananchawla_\nPhoto credit: @vandanasahni_\nJust a 10-minute walk away from Camden Town is the beautiful\nRegent's Park\n, another one of the city's royal parks. This massive green space of 410 acres has stunning flower beds, playgrounds for the little ones, a large boating lake, dining outlets, sports fields, and most importantly, lovely paths and alleys for you to go on a quiet stroll through the lush greens. We'd recommend allocating at least 2 hours just to explore this massive park.\nDid you know that Regent's Park also houses the\nLondon Zoo\n? Experience a world of wildlife right in the heart of London! A top place to visit for family travellers in the city, the zoo is actually one of the world's oldest scientific zoos, making it more than just your regular zoo. Over 20,000 animals from all over the world call it their home, including sloths, penguins, camels and alpacas. Come by and say hi to these furry friends!\nGet your tickets for entry to the London Zoo here!\n4. Sherlock Holmes Museum\nPhoto credit: @thesherlockholmesmuseum\nAny fans of the world's greatest detective out there? \ud83d\udd75\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f After your afternoon stroll through the park, head to the nearby 221B Baker Street (yes, the actual one in London!) and pay a visit to none other than the\nSherlock Holmes Museum\n. Paid entry into the museum is required, but you can feel free to drop by their gift shop for free and bring home memorabilia to prove that you've been to Sherlock Holmes' house.\n5. Dinner at Baker Street\nWhether or not you decided to drop by the museum,\nBaker Street\nitself, as well as its surrounding area, has many great options for dinner. Our personal recommendation would be to get wholesome burgers at Chicken Shop or comfort stir-fried food at Wok to Walk, but Bill's Baker Street Restaurant, Kitchen at Holmes or Royal China for more refined dining options.\n6. Monopoly Lifesized\nPhoto credit: @eattravelyogarepeat\nFancy a game of Monopoly after dinner? And not just any Monopoly - in London, take this classic board game to a whole other level with a visit to\nMonopoly Lifesized\n! Opened recently in 2021, this immersive attraction allows you to step into their larger-than-life world of Monopoly, with you being your own lifesized monopoly piece! There are even 4 lifesized boards for you to choose from, in which you can move around completing challenges to buy properties and compete against your friends and family.\nDay 4: Explore the City of London\n1. Breakfast at Ludgate Hill\nBefore a visit to the iconic St. Paul's Cathedral, make sure to get some breakfast to start your day!\nLudgate Hill\nand its surrounding areas offer quick breakfast stops at its various eateries, some of which include C\u00f4te St. Paul's, Pret A Manger, Poppins Cafe and Carter Lane Coffee House.\n2. St. Paul's Cathedral\nKick off your exploration of the City of London district with a visit to the magnificent\nSt. Paul's Cathedral\n. Built in the late 17th century, you may recognise this stunning Baroque building due to royal events such as the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana. After visiting its historic crypts and viewing the artworks on display downstairs, we'd highly recommend climbing up the building's 528 steps to the top to enjoy stunning views of London along the way, and then visiting the Whispering Gallery and Golden Gallery.\nEnjoy skip-the-the line admission into St. Paul's Cathedral!\n3. Leadenhall Market\nPhoto credit: @applechuaa\nTake a 15-minute walk to\nLeadenhall Market\n, probably one of the most stunning markets and building interiors that you'd find in the city. Built in the 14th century, this building is rich with 700 years of history, and is home to a selection of independent boutique stores, high-end retailers, elegant restaurants and cafes, as well as bars. It's the perfect lunch spot and some of our favourites include Tortilla, Giorgio, Pizza Express, as well as the upscale Bob Bob Ricard City.\n4. Sky Garden\nEnjoy another stunning vantage point of the city from the\nSky Garden\n, London's highest public garden. This leafy oasis is located on top of the walkie talkie skyscraper, treating you to not only a 360-degree view of the capital, but also lush landscaped gardens, refined restaurants, as well as two elegant bars for a midday drink. The best part is that entry is free, but spaces are limited, so do remember to book your slot in advance!\n5. St. Dunstan in the East Church Garden\nIf you're not a fan of touristy spots, then\nSt. Dunstan in the East\nis the perfect hidden gem in the city for you. Once a parish church of England, it was largely destroyed during the Second World War, and now the ruins of this abandoned church have become a public garden space. This green oasis is a lovely retreat from the busy city outside of it, with a fountain, all sorts of trees growing within, and vines flourishing the historic walls.\n6. Tower of London\nBuilt close to a thousand years ago, the famous\nTower of London\nis an ancient fortress that has served as a royal palace, a prison, as well as a place of execution. It's no doubt that this is a must-visit, especially if you're a history buff, and you can easily spend more than an hour exploring the grounds. One of the highlights include the Crown Jewels, a mesmerising display of jewel-studded crowns and sceptres, but we personally also enjoy going on a stroll through the lush outdoor gardens.\n#KlookTip:\nMany would recommend visiting and queueing early in the morning to avoid the crowds, but we personally like visiting it towards the end of the day because the largest crowds will generally start to thin out after 3 in the afternoon.\nJoin this guided half-day tour of landmarks in the City of London!\n7. River Thames Dinner Cruise\nIt's your last night in London, so why not treat yourself to a memorable\ndinner cruise along the River Thames\n? As the sun sets over the city, hop onto a luxurious showboat and get ready to indulge in a delicious four-course dinner with your loved ones. You'll even get to enjoy fun performances onboard, as well as stunning views of the city lit up at night!\nBook a dinner cruise in London here!\nDay 5: Go shopping at Covent Garden, Mayfair & Soho\n1. Breakfast at Covent Garden\nPhoto credit: @olichka_art\nPhoto credit: @thefairywoods\nBoasting a fantastic collection of shops, cafes, restaurants, and market stalls,\nCovent Garden\nand its Italian-style arcades are a shopper\u2019s paradise! There are three different markets in this district, including the famous Apple Market where you can find a range of unique handmade crafts, jewellery, antiques and more. There are also plenty of artist workshops and street performances that you can find in the area.\nBut before you begin shopping, why not grab a quick brekkie at one of Covent Garden's many restaurants? A few of our personal favourite spots are Bill's Covent Garden, Fernando's, 26 Grains, and Lilly's Cafe.\n2. British Museum\nPhoto credit: Nicolas Lysandrou\nPhoto credit: @fhanakoo\nProbably the most famous museum in the city, the\nBritish Museum\nholds an impressive collection of exhibits from all over the world, with over 100,000 antiquities that date back thousands of years. You can easily lose yourself in this museum's maze-like corridors and spend hours inside as you admire one exhibit after another, so to save some time, here are a few of our favourite ones that we'd recommend - the Parthenon Sculptures in Room 18, the Rosetta Stone in Room 4, and the Aztec Serpent in Room 27.\nWant to take your time to enjoy the museum the entire day? Don't worry as there are various restaurants and cafes located inside, to refuel yourself whenever you feel like it.\nEnjoy an elegant afternoon tea experience at the British Museum!\n3. Shopping at Mayfair\nPhoto credit: Jay Wennington\nSpend the rest of your day shopping at\nMayfair\n, where you can find the famous shopping streets of London. It's a large district to cover, but we recommend starting with\nOxford Street\n, Europe's busiest shopping street where you can find all sorts of flagship stores and smaller boutiques, as well as souvenir outlets. Once you've covered the entire street, you can continue your shopping spree at Regent Street and Piccadilly Circus, and then Bond Street, all of which have a huge variety of retail outlets where you can easily shop for hours.\n4. Chinatown\nPhoto credit: Bruno Martins\nWhenever we visit a new country, we always enjoy dropping by their\nChinatown\n, and London's one just so happens to be one of our favourites. This vibrant enclave in London's West End is beloved by both the locals and tourists. Not only can you find amazing Chinese food, Asian cosmetics and cute trinkets here, but the area itself is decorated beautifully with Chinese lanterns, which provide great photo opportunities.\n5. Soho\nPhoto credit: @choice_youn\nIf you've got time to spare, a visit to the lively district of\nSoho\nis a must! This vibrant neighbourhood is the place to go to find a stellar entertainment, dining and nightlife scene. If you've fulfilled all your shopping needs already, we highly recommend letting yourself unwind by catching a show at one of Soho's theatres, grab a drink at a jazz club or bar, or simply end your day with a full-blown dinner at a restaurant here.\nWhere to stay in London? \ud83c\udfe8\nLooking for a place to stay in the city?

All product, makeup, and clothing opinions expressed here are my own.\nWhen I sat down to plan how I was going to spend 4 days in London, I knew I had my work cut out for me. After all \u2013 when you think of European countries with must-see architecture and landmarks, London is definitely one of the first that comes to mind.\nLet\u2019s start with the facts: London has a LOT of tourist attractions. A LOT of must-see architecture. And a LOT of famous locations. Numerous scenes from Harry Potter and Game of Thrones were filmed here, and let\u2019s not forget\nAbbey Road\nand\nKings Cross Station\n. The downside? All these things aren\u2019t exactly close to each other.\nFiguring out how to spend 4 days in London in order to do all the sightseeing required a LOT of Google maps and strategic planning. To save you the time and trouble, I\u2019m sharing\nmy entire itinerary\nwith you here!\nIt\u2019s important to know that the culture in London is a lot different than you might expect. For cultural tips, where to stay, and how to get around, check out my other post \u2013\nLondon Travel Tips (For Your First Visit!)\n.\nThis blog post is part of a series of 3 destination posts that encompasses my 2022 Eurotrip to Paris, London, and Madrid. I planned all 3 destinations for me and my friend Kelly, who accompanied me on this journey!\nTo view the\nParis\npost, click here\nTo view the\nMadrid\npost, click here\nTrafalgar Square\nLondon Tours and Attractions from Get Your Guide\nI have some of these tours linked in individual sections below.

Although everything is accurate as of the publication of this post, it is important to keep in mind that prices, attractions, and other things may change with time.\n4 Days in London: The Itinerary\nTable of Contents\nDay 1\n\u2013 Tower Bridge, King\u2019s Cross Station,\nSt. Pancras Hotel,\nAuthentic British Pubs\nDay 2\n\u2013 House of Parliament/Big Ben, The London Eye, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, Afternoon Tea, Jack the Ripper Tour, The Shard\nDay 3\n\u2013 Oxford + Warner Bros Studios Day Trip, The Chocolate Cocktail Club\nDay 4\n\u2013 Abbey Rd, Piccadilly Circus/SoHo, Selfridges & Co, British Pub Crawl\n4 Days in London \u2013 The Itinerary\nDay 1: Travel Day \u2013 Tower Bridge, King\u2019s Cross Station, St. Pancras Hotel, & Authentic British Pubs\nOur flight landed in London from Paris at around 10:30am the morning of our arrival. By time we got to our hotel, it was around noon, so we set off to find lunch and do some exploring.\nFYI:\nIt should be noted that two of the attractions in this section, Tower Bridge and King\u2019s Cross Station, are a bit far from each other. However, doing them both in the same day was the best way to fit these 2 things into the itinerary overall.\n1. Tower Bridge\nLike I previously mentioned, the aesthetic of London is NYC meets medieval times.  The construction of\nTower Bridge\ndefinitely falls into the medieval times category. It is massive, gorgeous, and unlike any bridge I\u2019ve ever seen. You can even purchase\ntickets\nto tour the bridge and walk across the glass at the top!\nThe road that spans Tower Bridge also opens up in a drawbridge-type fashion to allow boats and other vessels to pass through the Thames River.\nFun Fact:\nTower Bridge is NOT considered a drawbridge due to the mechanism by which the roads are pulled up. Tower Bridge is actually a \u201cbascule bridge,\u201d because it doesn\u2019t require ropes or chains for the roads to come up the way a true drawbridge would.\nTower Bridge is one of London\u2019s most iconic and recognizable landmarks. It is built near the\nTower of London\n, which is a historic castle that you are also able to tour. You can purchase\ntickets\nto go inside the Tower of London and see the crown jewels, walk through the different towers, see the fortress, and more.\n2. King\u2019s Cross Station (For The Harry Potter Fans!)\nFrom Tower Bridge, we decided to go to\nKing\u2019s Cross\nStation\nand\nSt. Pancras\nHotel\n. These locations were a must-see for us\n(for 2 very important reasons!)\n, but they were also a good bit out of the way from some of the other tourist things we wanted to do. In terms of time, it made the most sense to fit them in on our travel day.\nIf you are a Harry Potter fan, you\u2019ve definitely heard of\nKing\u2019s Cross station\n.\nThe train station made famous in the series for\nPlatform 9\n3/4\n, which Harry crosses to board the Hogwarts Express, actually\ndoes\nexist. Well\u2026kind of.\nGoing to Hogwarts!\nIn between Platforms 9 & 10, they have a trolley half hidden in the wall, as if it were crossing through into the wizarding world. Right next to the trolley is a Harry Potter store. You are allowed to get your photo taken with the trolley, which the Harry Potter employees help facilitate. You are even allowed to pick out which color scarf you want for your respective House (and if you don\u2019t know your House, you can take\nthis quiz\non\nWizarding World\n\u2013 previously known as Pottermore \u2013 to find out!).\nFun fact\n: I am a Slytherin, and we\u2019re not all bad \ud83d\ude09\n(Another) Fun Fact\n: the Harry Potter scenes were actually filmed between Platforms 4 & 5, but they placed the trolley in its rightful theatrical place for photos.\n3. St. Pancras Hotel (For the Spice Girls Fans!)\nRight next to King\u2019s Cross station is\nSt. Pancras Renaissance Hotel\n, an absolutely huge, gorgeous hotel that is 100% worth seeing. In fact, it is so stunningly beautiful that the King\u2019s Cross exterior shots were filmed here for the Harry Potter movies, instead of at the actual train station.\nSt. Pancras Hotel in London, England\nAside from Harry Potter, the main reason I wanted to visit this hotel is because the\nSpice Girls\nfilmed the video for \u201c\nWannabe\n\u201d on the steps inside. You are able to go in and take your photo on these steps and, well,\nspice up your life\n.\nIf you grew up in the 90\u2019s, you know what a huge deal this is. I spent countless hours singing and dancing to the music video for this song when it came on TV, and now I was standing on the actual steps it was filmed on.\nWild.\nWhen you come in the main hotel entrance, you can find the steps by going off to your\nleft\nout of the main room once you leave the entryway. If you\u2019re unsure, one of the hotel employees will be able to show you.\n\u2026and for the record, my favorite Spice Girl is Posh Spice!\n4. And Finally\u2026Hit Up an Authentic British Pub\nWe ended our travel day/first day by trying fish & chips at an authentic British pub.\nBut how do you know which pubs are authentic?\nFrom a local: \u201c\nthe corner pubs are the most authentic\n.\u201d Traditional pubs will typically have a painted wooden sign outside with the pub name in fancy old English script. We took this advice, found a corner pub bestowed with an old yet authentic looking sign, and had the best fish & chips of our life. The pub we found was called\nThe Marquis Cornwallis\n, but I\u2019m sure any authentic pub can give you incredible London food!\nIt is worth mentioning that there is a certain \u201cetiquette\u201d when it comes to\nordering a beer at an English pub\n, and unfortunately, Kelly and I learned this the hard way. To save yourself the embarrassment, read the\n\u201cPub Etiquette\u201d\nsection of my\nother London post\n.\nDay 2: Full Day \u2013 House of Parliament & Big Ben, The London Eye, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, Afternoon Tea, Jack the Ripper Tour & The Shard\nIf you just read that and thought,\n\u201cphew, that\u2019s a lot!\u201d\n\u2026well, you\u2019re right. I tend to take the \u201cI\u2019ll sleep when I\u2019m dead\u201d approach when I\u2019m on vacation. If you find that this is too much for you to fit in one day, my suggestion would be to move either the Jack the Ripper tour and/or the Shard to Day 4 of this post.\n1. House of Parliament/Big Ben\nSeeing the House of Parliament and Big Ben is, of course, a must do when you go to London.\nBig Ben\nis one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world, and was every bit as beautiful in person as I imagined it would be.\nBig Ben is attached to the\nHouse of Parliament\n, the oldest royal palace in London. The architecture, not to mention the gold on the outside, is absolutely stunning. To arrive here by Tube, you will exit at the\nWestminster\ntube station \u2013 but be warned, this station, not to mention entire area, is\ncrowded\n. Watch for pickpockets!\nHouse of Parliament/Big Ben\n2. Ride The London Eye\nFrom Big Ben, you can walk across the Westminster Bridge to the\nLondon Eye\n. Not only is the bridge itself beautiful, but you will be able to get some stunning photos from the bridge as well!\nThe London Eye\nThe London Eye\nis a huge ferris wheel with massive pods that you are able to ride to get top-notch views of the city. You can book\ntickets\nin advance, or you can also book when you get there (but tickets will be more expensive). They also have a skip-the-line option (but, let\u2019s be honest, there will still be a line. It might just move faster if you choose that ticket).\nYou will be able to get views of the House of Parliament/Big Ben, The Shard, different palaces, the Thames River, and more. This is a super relaxing activity and a perfect way to rest your feet after all that walking!\nViews from the London Eye \u2013 The Shard and the city center\nViews from the London Eye \u2013 Big Ben/House of Parliament, Westminster Bridge, and the Thames River\n3. Tour Westminster Abbey\nAfter riding the London Eye, you will have roughly a 13 minute walk to Westminster Abbey. I had every intention of touring\nWestminster Abbey\n, but unfortunately did not get to. The day I was there, they were having an event and you weren\u2019t able to go inside. However, Westminster Abbey is going to be one building that I absolutely recommend you tour. I have been told by numerous people that it is a must-do, and judging by photos of the inside, they aren\u2019t wrong.\nWestminister Abbey\nYou can choose any of these activities from\nGet Your Guide\nto tour Westminster Abbey:\n4. Admire Buckingham Palace\nFrom Westminster Abbey, it is about a 15 minute walk to\nBuckingham Palace\n. You are able to tour the palace as well, but there are more restrictions. Buckingham Palace only has tours in the summer months, and since the royals still live and work there, it is limited on what all you get to see.\nYou are able to watch the\nChanging of the Guards\nat Buckingham Palace every\nMonday\n,\nWednesday\n,\nFriday\n, and\nSunday\nat\n10:45am\n. If this is on your bucket list, you may want to restructure this part of the itinerary and come earlier in the day before you see Big Ben/House of Parliament.\nIf you desire to see this, you can book this\nBuckingham Palace with Changing of the Guards ticket\nfrom\nGet Your Guide\nhere!\nBuckingham Palace\n5. Trafalgar Square and Afternoon Tea\nFrom Buckingham Palace, it\u2019s about an 18 minute walk to\nTrafalgar Square\n. This is a lively square with a picturesque fountain that is surrounded by restaurants and pubs, statues, and historic buildings. By now, you must be exhausted, so this is also a great place to stop for some\nafternoon tea\n, a popular British tradition.\nTaking a break by one of the fountains at Trafalgar Square\nGetting afternoon tea is one of those cultural must-do\u2019s when you come to London, even if you\u2019re someone who, like me, hates hot tea.\n/shrug\nAfter seeing Trafalgar Square, we decided on a restaurant called\nThe Admiralty\nthat served afternoon tea with a small scone. You could also get lunch here if you wanted, along with your tea.\nA lot of places will advertise that they do afternoon tea on their signs outside, so no matter where you are, it\u2019s easy to get your tea fix. I wouldn\u2019t go out of your way to plan for this!\n6. Jack the Ripper Tour\nWho doesn\u2019t love a good serial killer tour? A local guide takes you through the streets in a (rather sketchy) part of London and shows you where Jack the Ripper killed his victims, along with teaching you about the history of the city during the late 1800\u2019s.\nI booked this tour through the\nofficial website\n, and would absolutely recommend it. Our tour guide was extremely knowledgable, funny, and very entertaining. We also saw parts of London that we would never have gone to on our own through this tour.\nPro Tip:\nIf one serial killer experience is not enough for you, they also have the\nJack the Ripper Museum\nin London as well!\n7. The Shard \u2013 View From the Top\nThe Shard\nThe Shard\nis the tallest building in the UK and one of the most recognizable buildings in London. It is unique in that it houses a variety of different things, from offices to hotel rooms to a public viewing gallery and more. There are also 7 different restaurants and bars to choose from.\nWe ended our night by having drinks from\nAqua Shard\n\u2013 a bar on the 31st floor of the building. From here, we were able to unwind from our long day with breathtaking views of the city!\nPro Tip:\nMake a\nreservation\n, just in case!\nView of the city from the Aqua Shard\nDay 3: Full Day \u2013 Oxford + Warner Bros Studios Day Trip, and The Chocolate Cocktail Club\n1. Oxford + Warner Bros Studios \u2013 The Making of Harry Potter\nI booked a day trip for us through\nGet Your Guide\nto visit\nOxford, England\n, as well as tour\nWarner Bros. Studios \u2013 The Making of Harry Potter\n. You are able to see the sets, props, costumes, and more that were used when filming all 8 Harry Potter movies. You can book JUST the studio tour if you want, but Get Your Guide also has an option where you spend the morning exploring Oxford and then go to Warner Bros Studios after.\nOxford University\nOverall,\nI 10/10 recommend doing the Warner Bros Studio tour with the Oxford add-on\nif you can. If you are a Harry Potter fan, this will be life-changing. At the end of our Eurotrip, Kelly and I both agreed it was our favorite thing that we did the entire 2 weeks we were in Europe.\n2. The Chocolate Cocktail Club\nIn a country that is essentially known for its beer and pubs, finding out that there was a bar dedicated to chocolate cocktails in London was a dream. I chose to make a reservation here after coming back from the Oxford/Harry Potter tour because it sounded like the perfect way to relax after a long day\u2026\nand it was\n.\nThe Chocotini\nThe Chocolate Cocktail Club\nhas an extensive drink menu dedicated to (what else?) chocolate themed cocktails. You are able to buy a ticket (in the form of a reservation) that includes one free drink of your choice. You are able to choose between 3 different cocktails, including their signature cocktail, the\nChocotini\n.\nMy 2nd drink \u2013 the \u201cNutty for Chocolate\u201d\nThey also have a food menu that includes small bites to go along with your drinks. We got the\ncharcuterie board\nand it was amazing!\nThe (chocolate themed) charcuterie board\nYou are also able to get your\nafternoon tea\nfix here! The Chocolate Cocktail Club offers a selection of sandwiches, scones, and cakes that are deliciously paired with hot chocolate, tea, or coffee. You can also get a Chocotini cocktail or Prosecco for an up-charge.\nIf there are any chocolate haters in your group, they have a completely separate menu of regular drinks including wine, beer, gin, and soft drinks.\nDay 4: Last Full Day \u2013 Abbey Road, Piccadilly Circus/SoHo, Selfridges & Co., and a Pub Crawl\n1. Walk the Abbey Road Crosswalk\nEven if you aren\u2019t a Beatles fan, getting your photo taken in the iconic Abbey Road crosswalk is, in my opinion, a must-do when you go to London. After all \u2013 it\u2019s not every day that you have the opportunity to walk in the literal footsteps of the most influential band of all time!\nAbbey Road Crosswalk\nAbbey Road is a bit out of the way from the rest of the tourist attractions we were going to do, which is why we decided to save this for our last day. However, finding the right crosswalk can be a bit confusing.\nHow to Find The Abbey Road Crosswalk\nWhen searching for the location, it is important to type in \u201c\nThe Beatles crosswalk\n\u201d into your Google maps, and\nNOT\n\u201cAbbey Road.\u201d\nTyping in \u201cAbbey Road\u201d will take you near a crosswalk, but it is NOT the correct one.\nWant to know the worst part? If you type in \u201cAbbey Road,\u201d Google maps will label it as \u201cRoad seen on the iconic Beatles album.\u201d (See photo below on the\nleft\n).\nThis is wrong!!\nWhat you want to see is the\nroads coming together to form a triangular shape, and the red location marker is ACTUALLY on a crosswalk\n. (See photo on the\nright\n). You will also know you are at the right location because there will be groups of people waiting to take their iconic photo.\nThis location is\nNOT CORRECT\nThis location\nIS CORRECT\n2. Explore Piccadilly Circus\nFrom Abbey Rd, it is about a 30 minute Tube ride to Piccadilly Circus and SoHo.\nGETTING HERE:\nWalk to the ST. JOHN\u2019S WOOD station and get on the\nJUBILEE\nline towards STRATFORD on Platform 2.\nExit at the GREEN PARK station.\nWalk ~12 minutes.\nSome of the buildings and decor of Piccadilly Circus\nPiccadilly Circus\nis a popular tourist destination and the most famous square in the West End of London. It serves as a junction that connects 6 very busy streets, and is one of the notable Harry Potter filming locations. There are giant, \u201cTimes Square\u201d looking screens showing advertisements on the buildings, and the whole area is buzzing with people.\nFor the Harry Potter fans, the scene where Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape the Death Eaters at Bill and Fleur\u2019s wedding from Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows was filmed here!\nThis is a really fun area to walk around and explore. The architecture is beautiful, there are great restaurants, and the\nEros Fountain\nis a sight to behold. I did not get a good photo of it, but it is a large fountain with essentially what looks like a statue of Cupid on top. I later learned that in Roman mythology,\nCupid\nis equivalent to\nEros\n, the Greek god of carnal love! In fact, this is where the word \u201cerotic\u201d comes from.\nFun Fact:\nEven though the fountain is called Eros Fountain, the \u201ccupid\u201d on top is actually supposed to be Anteros, Eros\u2019s brother!\n3. Walk Through the Colorful Streets of SoHo\nSoHo in the daytime\nSoHo at night\nSoHo\nis a lively, fun neighborhood with tons of bars, restaurants, and shops within walking distance from Piccadilly Circus. Kelly and I stumbled upon SoHo as we were exploring Piccadilly Circus, so I grouped them together for the sake of this post.\nIn SoHo amidst the restaurants and shops, there are neon string lights hanging from the buildings that adds to the already \u201c\nthis is the place to be!\n\u201d vibe once it gets dark. If you haven\u2019t already guessed, this was my favorite neighborhood.\nSoHo at night\nSoHo shopping suggestion: astrid & miyu\nIn SoHo, they have a store called\nAstrid & Miyu\nwhere you can hop on the welded jewelry trend and get a bracelet permanently welded onto your wrist. The chains are made from high quality metal, and they also have charms you can choose from. I thought it would be the perfect way for me to always remember my 2022 Eurotrip, so I opted to get a rose gold bracelet with a matching rose gold charm.\nAstrid & Miyu accepts walk-ins, but due to this being a popular trend, it\u2019s best to\nmake an appointment\n.\nI actually first learned about this trend (and got my first bracelet!) in Nashville, which you can read about in my\nNashville blog post\n.\nSoHo Pub suggestion: shakespeare\u2019s Head\nWe also stumbled upon this pub called\nShakespeare\u2019s Head\n, which was founded by 2 men who were distant relatives of William Shakespeare. It\u2019s a very picturesque, traditional Old English pub with a good beer selection. Located in the heart of SoHo, it\u2019s a great place to grab a pint and people watch!\nShakespeare\u2019s Head in SoHo\n3. Walk Through Selfridges & Co.\nPro Tip:\nIf you aren\u2019t much of a shopper, Selfridge\u2019s isn\u2019t a must-do. If you are, you should definitely walk through it!\nSelfridges\nis with out a doubt the largest,\nboujee-est\ndepartment store I have ever set foot in. It is located in a massive building right near SoHo. Think of every upscale department store you have ever frequented and multiply it by 50, then add wine, food, chocolates, charcuterie, and even flowers and plants.\nYes, it is expensive. But if you are in the mood to\ntreat yo\u2019self\n, or even just want somewhere to walk around and admire all the pretty things, Selfridge\u2019s is the way to go. If you aren\u2019t much of a shopper, you will probably be overwhelmed. If you are a shopper, this will likely be your paradise.\n4. And Finally\u2026Do a Pub Crawl\nIf you read my\nParis Itinerary Post\n, you knew this was coming. Kelly and I did a \u201ccrawl\u201d in every city that we visited, and the crawl was based around the drink that was most popular in that particular city. In London, doing a\npub crawl around SoHo\nwas the perfect way to end our last day.\nI would tell you all the pubs that we went to, but if I\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t remember them all. The London beer will do that to you.\nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2013 you really can\u2019t go wrong. There are hundreds upon hundreds of pubs, and they will all give you your beer fix. I tended to navigate towards the corner pubs that were painted black with colorful flowers on the outside, because, well\u2026\naesthetics\n. If you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about yet, you will. They\u2019re everywhere.\nPro Tip:\ndon\u2019t forget that the bar etiquette in London is somewhat different than in the United States.

It\u2019s one of my favorite destinations in the entire world and a city that would take a lifetime to see.\nI\u2019ve been to the city more times than I remember \u2014\nI even moved there for a while\n\u2014 yet I\u2019ve barely scratched its surface.\nUnderstandably, planning a trip to Paris is hard. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen everything the city has to offer, you find new attractions, new caf\u00e9s, or new markets to explore (not to mention visiting\nDisneyland Paris\n). There are layers to this city \u2014 which is partially why I love it so much.\nMost travelers seem to visit Paris for around three days before moving on. They see the highlights, snap some photos, and move on.\nWhile three days is better than nothing, I think you need more time than that. Ideally, I think you should plan on spending at least five days in Paris in order to see the bare minimum of what the City of Lights has to offer. There\u2019s just too much to do.\nTo help you plan your trip to Paris and figure out what to see, what to do, where to stay, and where to eat, here\u2019s my suggested itinerary for a five-day visit (and some other suggestions in case you decide to spend longer there!)\nParis Itinerary Highlights\nDay 1\n:\nChamps-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Arc de Triomphe, the Latin Quarter, & more!\nDay 2\n:\nLouvre, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie, & more!\nDay 3\n:\nThe Palace of Versailles, P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, & more!\nDay 4\n:\nEiffel Tower, Les Invalides, Holocaust Museum, & more!\nDay 5\n:\nParis Catacombs, Rue Mouffetard, Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, & more!\nWhere to Eat\n:\nMy Favorite Restaurants in Paris\nWhat to See in Paris: Day 1\nSpend your first day walking around Paris. There\u2019s a lot to see, and you can spend a good half day (or whole day) wandering the cobblestone streets, parks, and neighborhoods of the city. If you want to orient yourself with a free walking tour,\nNew Europe\nruns regular walking tours that cover the highlights. Just make sure to tip your guide at the end.\nFor paid tours, check out\nTake Walks\n. They are my go-to walking tour company when I want something more in-depth and informative. They have all kinds of walking tours (as well as museum and\nfood tours\n). There\u2019s something for every interest!\nHowever, if you want to follow my own walking tour, here\u2019s my suggested route for an \u201corientation walk\u201d around Paris:\nStart at the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and\nsee the Arc de Triomphe\n. There isn\u2019t usually a line, and you\u2019ll get sweeping views of the city to start your day. Stroll down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and through Place de la Concorde, where you will see the Luxor Obelisk, which the French stole from the Egyptians. It\u2019s over 3,000 years old and stands 75-meters (246 feet) tall. This square was also where they guillotined people during the French Revolution (1789-1799).\nWalk down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es through the Jardin des Tuileries, a beautiful garden that was once home to a palace that burned down in the 1800s. Stop and admire the Louvre before continuing down Rue Rivoli and crossing into the original section of the city on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. This is where the Romans built their original settlement, (called Lutetia, which was the basis for the modern-day city of Paris.\nEnjoy the Pont Neuf and the statue of Henry IV. This stone bridge, the first in Paris, was built in 1578. Stroll to my favorite church of all time, Sainte Chapelle, with its incredible 12th-century stained glass. There\u2019s usually a line, so\nbook tickets in advance\n. You\u2019ll skip the huge line (sometimes the wait is over an hour).\nAfter that, head to the underground Roman ruins and then visit Notre Dame, the world\u2019s most famous Gothic church. It was damaged in a fire in 2019 and is still closed, however, you can still admire the building as it\u2019s still being repaired.\nNext, head south toward the Latin Quarter. This area is rather touristy but if you get off the main drag, you\u2019ll find yourself in a labyrinth of alleys and caf\u00e9-lined squares that are far away from the local tourist hangouts.\nVisit the Pantheon and honor France\u2019s most famous dead citizens before heading west toward the Jardin du Luxembourg, where you can relax and watch life go by. There\u2019s great people-watching here, and it\u2019s one of the best parks in the city.\nAfter that, head north to see Saint Sulpice. If you\u2019re into\nThe Da Vinci Code\n, you\u2019ll be looking for symbols and hidden meanings throughout this church. If symbols don\u2019t interest you, just marvel at how grandiose this place is.\nBy this time, it should be late in the afternoon and a perfect time to stop in a caf\u00e9, order some wine, and relax the Parisian way.\nWhat to See in Paris: Day 2\nThe Louvre\nWith over a million pieces of art, you could spend a whole month in the Louvre and still not see everything. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy medieval art; it\u2019s too religious for me, and I can only see so many pictures of Mary and Jesus before I get bored.\nIf that\u2019s not your thing, there are plenty of impressionist period gems like Monet, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, and other masters. Nevertheless, the museum is worth seeing, and I spent about five hours exploring all the masterpieces and marveling at the old royal palace. You could easily spend more time if you\u2019re an art buff too. If you\u2019d just like to see the highlights, expect to spend a couple of hours.\nTimed skip-the-line tickets\ncost 17 EUR. Post-Covid, you definitely want to get these as they often run out of tickets as, to deal with the crowds, they have started limited the number of visitors per day.\nYou can also take a\nguided tour around the Louvre\n(which also skips the line) if you really want to dive into the incredible art in this museum. You\u2019ll learn much, much more this way.\nMus\u00e9e du Louvre, 1st arrondissement, +33 1 40 20 53 17, louvre.fr. Open Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and weekends from 9am\u20136pm, and Fridays from 9am\u20139:45pm. Closed Tuesdays. Admission is 17 EUR. They also offer free admission for all visitors on the first Sunday of each month October-March and on Bastille Day (14 July). Admission is also free for EU residents under 26. To avoid the massive lines, enter via the Carrousel du Louvre entrance and you\u2019ll get right to the ticket counter. You can also skip the lines if you have a\nParis Museum Pass\n.\nMus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay\nThe Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, located in close proximity to the Louvre, houses the best impressionist and post-impressionist work in Paris. It\u2019s one of the largest museums in Europe and my favorite museum in Paris. I always go when I\u2019m in town. The museum sees over 3 million visitors each year and is home to masterpieces by all the great artists of the world, including Degas, Monet, Manet, and Van Gogh, to name a few. I could spend hours here and never get bored.\n1 Rue de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur, 7th arrondissement, +33 1 40 49 48 14, musee-orsay.fr. Open Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday-Sunday from 9:30am\u20136pm and Thursdays from 9:30am\u20139:45pm. Closed Mondays.\nAdmission is 17 EUR\n(or 9 EUR after 4:30pm every day but Thursday). It\u2019s free on the first Sunday of the month.\nBe sure to buy tickets in advance\nso you can skip the long line.\nMus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie\nFinish off a wild museum day with this Monet showcase. The museum displays eight tapestry-sized\nNymph\u00e9as\n(water lilies), housed in two plain oval rooms. Monet painted these images later in his life, and each one represents a different time of day and season. There\u2019s a bottom floor that shows other works too. It\u2019s a beautiful museum.\nJardin des Tuileries, Place de la Concorde, 1st arrondissement, +33 1 44 50 43 00, musee-orangerie.fr. Open Wednesday-Monday from 9am\u20136pm; last entry at 5:15pm. Closed Tuesdays. Admission is 12.50 EUR and is free on the first Sunday of the month.\nBudget travel tip:\nGet the Paris Museum Pass\n. This pass covers over 50 museums and attractions in Paris. It covers all the museums above, so getting this pass and using it to see all the attractions listed in this article will save you a ton of money. A two-day pass costs 55 EUR, a four-day pass costs 70 EUR, and a six-day pass costs 85 EUR. Plus, it will let you skip all the long lines that these attractions have.\nNOTE:\nPeople will say \u201cThat\u2019s too much to do in a day! Those museums take a day each!\u201d And they are right. These museums can actually take DAYS to see. But, if you\u2019re short on time, you can see the highlights of each in a very long day. Or don\u2019t and take your time in each museum. This itinerary is just a mere suggestion anyways!\nPlanning a trip to Europe?\nGet all my best travel tips along with these guides:\nTravel Planning 101\n61 Savvy Travel Tips\nThe Best Hostels in Europe\nMy Favorite Travel Companies\nHow to Get Free Flights to Europe\nEnter your info below to get your\nFREE\nguides sent to you today!\nGet the free guide\nWhat to See in Paris: Day 3\nThe Palace of Versailles\nLocated just outside of Paris,\nthe Palace of Versailles\nwas a hunting lodge before becoming the primary residence of the Kings of France until the French Revolution. A decadent symbol of royal power, the palace sees over 10 million visitors each year.\nIt takes a full day to really enjoy a trip here. Spend the day exploring the ch\u00e2teau, get lost in the surrounding gardens, and soak up the extravagant lifestyle of France\u2019s former monarchy. Make sure you see the estate of Trianon (known as Marie Antoinette\u2019s estate) as well, which includes a fake peasant village created to provide scenic views and fresh milk and eggs for the Queen.\nVersailles is massive and beautiful so don\u2019t rush your visit. Most people see the Palace first, then the gardens, and then Marie-Antoinette\u2019s estate. If you do everything in reverse, you\u2019ll be able to avoid the crowds. Additionally, go on a weekday to avoid the worst of the crowds.\nIf you really want a deep dive,\ntake a guided tour of Versailles\nwith Walks. You\u2019ll not only skip the line (which will save you a ton of time) but you\u2019ll get an expert local guide who can really bring the history to life.\nHere\u2019s a video tour of the Palace of Versailles to whet your appetite:\nPlace d\u2019Armes, Versailles, +33 1 30 83 78 00, en.chateauversailles.fr. Open Tuesday\u2013Sunday 9am\u20135:30pm with the last entry at 5pm. Closed Mondays. \u201cThe Passport\u201d ticket gives you admission to all the palace tours (grounds, Trianon Palaces, and Marie Antoinette\u2019s estate), the Musical Fountain Show, the Musical Gardens, and the exhibitions for 28.50 EUR (21.50 EUR during the low season).\nGuided tours with GYG that skip-the-line\ncost 55 EUR. I highly recommend a guided tour because there\u2019s not a lot of signage in the building so you don\u2019t really get any context around what you are seeing.\nP\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery\nFinish off the day with a train ride east of the city center to visit\nParis\u2019s most famous graveyard\n, where you\u2019ll see the graves of celebrities like Antonio de La Gandara, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Sarah Bernhardt, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Jim Morrison, \u00c9dith Piaf, Camille Pissarro, Gertrude Stein, and Oscar Wilde.\nBuilt in 1804, it\u2019s named after Louis XIV\u2019s confessor, P\u00e8re Fran\u00e7ois de la Chaise (1624\u20131709), who lived in a house near the cemetery. Initially, the locals considered the cemetery too far from the city so administrators devised a plan. They moved the remains of Jean de La Fontaine (fabulist) and Moli\u00e8re (playwright), two of Paris\u2019s most famous artists, to P\u00e8re Lachaise, hoping that people would want to be buried near France\u2019s famous heroes.\nIt worked, and today it\u2019s the city\u2019s most iconic graveyard \u2014 and the most visited cemetery in the world. Just make sure you\u2019re out before it closes at 5:30pm.\nGuided tours cost 20 EUR\nand last three hours. I recommend taking a tour if you can. There\u2019s not a lot of signage here so you don\u2019t really get any information about the cemetery without a tour.\nWhat to See in Paris: Day 4\nEiffel Tower\nThe Eiffel Tower is Paris\u2019 most iconic monument. Built in the 1880s for the 1889 World Fair, it was actually disliked by many people when it was first built. Today, the locals love it; it\u2019s a symbol of the city and one of the most recognized buildings in the world. Standing 324 meters (1,062 feet) tall, it offers the best views of the entire city. To beat the crowds, get here early in the morning. If you wait until the afternoon, you\u2019ll find yourself waiting in line for hours.\nAfterward, have a picnic on the grass and enjoy the sunshine and the views. It\u2019s one of my favorite things to do in the city.\nChamp de Mars, 7th arrondissement, +33 8 92 70 12 39, toureiffel.paris. Open daily (9am\u2013midnight) during the summer, with slightly shorter hours during the rest of the year. Admission is 18.10-28.30 EUR per person, depending on how high you go. You can also pay for\ndirect access to an elevator that takes you to the top\nfor 35 EUR.\nWander Rue Cler\nLocated near the Eiffel Tower, this street is filled with good Parisian eateries. You\u2019ll find cheese, meat, bread, vegetable, and chocolate stores to explore. I never walk away from this street without a pile of food and wine.\nWhenever I\u2019m here, I eat my way through this street and then buy more for later. It\u2019s one of my favorite streets in Paris.\nParis Sewer Museum\nThis tour is definitely an off-the-beaten-path attraction and isn\u2019t too far away from the Eiffel Tower. You\u2019ll learn about the interesting history of\nParis\u2019s sewer system\n.\nYou may be put off by the idea of a \u201csewer tour,\u201d but don\u2019t be. It doesn\u2019t smell down there and you\u2019ll learn how modern Paris came to be. Before there was a suitable drainage system, waste from the city just ended up in the river. It then spread disease and polluted the entire area, putting the entire city at risk. It wasn\u2019t until the city developed a complex sewer system that it was able to overcome diseases, boost trade, and develop into the world-class city that it is today.\nPont de l\u2019Alma, Left Bank, opposite 93 Quai d\u2019Orsay, 7th arrondissement, +33 1 53 68 27 81, musee-egouts.paris.fr/en/. Open Tuesday to Sunday from 10am\u20135pm. Admission is 9 EUR.\nLes Invalides (The Tomb of Napoleon)\nAlso known as H\u00f4tel National des Invalides, this enormous complex was built in 1670 by Louis XIV as a hospital for wounded soldiers. Nowadays, it\u2019s home to several museums and monuments, including the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Arm\u00e9e (the Military Museum of the Army of France) and Napoleon\u2019s tomb. It is one of the most comprehensive history museums I\u2019ve ever visited, and you\u2019ll need at least three hours to see it properly.\nWhile military history may seem boring, this museum is really a history of France, the Revolution, and Napoleon. It is fascinating and incredible in its depth. I cannot recommend it enough.\nPlace des Invalides, Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Arm\u00e9e, 129 Rue de Grenelle, 7th arrondissement, +33 810 11 33 99. Open daily from April through October (10am\u20136pm; Tuesdays until 9pm), and 10am\u20135pm from November through March. Admission is 14 EUR.\nThe Museum of the Shoah (The Holocaust Museum)\nDespite having an excellent exhibit on France, anti-Semitism, and the Holocaust, the Museum of the Shoah never draws a lot of people. It\u2019s a real shame, as the information and collection here is really great and in-depth. I\u2019ve been to many Holocaust museums, and this is one of the best and most detailed in the world. I highly recommend it.\n17 Rue Geoffroy l\u2019Asnier, 4th arrondissement, +33 1 42 77 44 72, memorialdelashoah.org. Open Sunday\u2013Friday 10am\u20136pm and Thursdays from 10am\u201310pm. Closed Saturdays. Admission is free and a free guided tour is given at 3pm (in English) on the second Sunday of every month.\nWhat to See in Paris: Day 5\nParis Catacombs\nThe Catacombs of Paris\nare a fascinating but grim tourist attraction. They go on for miles (no one really knows how far) and the endless winding tunnels house thousands of bones. Only a small section of the tunnels is open, and there\u2019s a ton of history and information about the growth of Paris. The Catacombs themselves are actually old stone quarries that were located far outside the edge of the city during medieval times. There\u2019s always a long line, so book your\nskip-the-line tickets online\nbeforehand and don\u2019t wait outside. Because that line can take hours!\n1 Avenue du Colonel Henri Rol-Tanguy, 14th arrondissement, +33 1 43 22 47 63, catacombes.paris.fr. Open Tuesday\u2013Sunday 9:45am\u20138:30pm; last admission at 7:30pm. Closed Mondays. Check the website before you go \u2014 the Catacombs are sometimes closed without warning or explanation. Admission is 18 EUR for last-minute tickets sold the day of. The audio guide is 5 EUR. Advanced tickets are 29 EUR (including the audio guide).\nRue Mouffetard\nThis pedestrian street is filled with caf\u00e9s and shops and has an outdoor market. It\u2019s great to just wander down or for sitting in front of a caf\u00e9 and watch Parisian life go by. Make sure to stop by the nearby Place de la Contrescarpe too. There are some good and inexpensive restaurants in the area, making it a nice place to stop for a while and watch life go by.\nMus\u00e9e de Cluny\nThe Cluny Museum, also known as the National Museum of the Middle Ages, is the finest surviving example of medieval architecture in Paris. Built in the 15th century, it was the former home of the abbots of Cluny and now houses Roman and medieval art, including many architectural fragments found during excavations around the city.\nThe museum also contains the adjoining rooms of a Roman bath, which the abbey was built over. It is by far one of the most interesting history museums in the city and worth every euro of the admission fee!\n6 Place Paul Painlev\u00e9, 5th arrondissement, +33 1 53 73 78 16, musee-moyenage.fr. Open Tuesday to Sunday 9:30am\u20136:15pm. Closed Mondays. Admission is 12 EUR and free on the first Sunday of every month.\nBiblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France\nOne of the grandest libraries in the world, the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France was founded in 1368 by Charles V. Stop in for a quick visit and be sure to take a peek at the old rotunda of the art library and the 20-foot globes in the permanent collection. The collection is massive at over 40 million items, including some 15 million books and over 5,000 manuscripts from Ancient Greece.\nQuai Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, 13th arrondissement, +33 1 53 79 59 59, bnf.fr. Open Monday from 2pm-8pm), Tuesday-Saturday from 9am-8pm, and Sundays from 1pm-7pm. Admission is free.\nMontmartre\nAnother artistic center of Paris, this is where artists and writers like Hemingway spent their time. There\u2019s still a lot of art, and you\u2019ll find galleries and artists throughout the area. The streets are quiet and beautiful to wander around. Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur (the church here) offers a superb view of the city and is a great place to have lunch. You can also see the famous \u201csinking house\u201d here too (an Insta-famous house that, from the right angle, looks like it\u2019s sinking into the hill). It\u2019s a great area to\ntake a food tour\ntoo.\nIn the evening, the stairs near the church fill up with people watching the sunset, chatting, and drinking. There are usually lots of buskers here too making it one of the best places in the city to soak up the city in the evening.\nWhere to Eat in Paris\nI have eaten in so many places in Paris. My Google maps is just filled with saved restaurants and bars! Here\u2019s a list of a few places to get you started:\nCaf\u00e9 P\u00e8re & Fils\n\u2014 Caf\u00e9 P\u00e8re & Fils is a Parisian brasserie and coffee shop with outdoor seating for lunch and drinks.\nFlorence Kahn\n\u2014 This perfect little shop has a blue mosaic shopfront. They make really delicious sandwiches \u2014 try the pastrami.\nISTR\n\u2014 ISTR is extremely trendy and usually busy for dinner, but I highly recommend its happy hour, when the wine and oysters are cheap.\nKing Falafel Place\n\u2014 Some of the best falafel in Paris. There\u2019s usually a line but it moves quickly.\nLa Cr\u00eaperie des Artes\n\u2014 This tiny to-go cr\u00eaperie is the best in all of Paris (in my opinion). Cheap, delicious, and large portions \u2014 you can\u2019t go wrong here.\nLe Dit Vin\n\u2014 The prices are reasonable, there is a large wine selection, and the menu changes daily depending on what\u2019s fresh. It\u2019s one of my absolute favorite spots in the city\nPizzeria Popolare\n\u2014 Some of the best pizza in  Paris. Get there early. The line is LONG.\nJuveniles\n\u2014 An awesome bistro near the Louvre with a rotating menu in a compact space.\nRobert et Louise\n\u2014 This place serves lots of meat and roasts from an open fire. It\u2019s a hearty meal. Great wine selection too!\nIf you want even more places to eat and drink in Paris,\nget my city guide which features a complete list\n!\n***\nAdmittedly, even with five days in\nParis\n, you\u2019ll barely scratch the surface of the city. It\u2019s just too massive, nuanced, and layered. The history, the architecture, the charm \u2014 it\u2019s unlike any other place in the world.\nHowever, you will still be able to see many of the highlights and get a sense of just how amazing Paris really is.

Meander in the gardens and parks, take a long lunch, watch that band, sit by the Seine, and linger over that bottle of wine.

Some people say it is overrated, but I couldn\u2019t disagree more! No matter what type of travel you like, I promise you need to see the Eiffel Tower sparkle at some point in your life!!\nI first visited Paris in 2012 with my family and got to go back in summer of 2022 with my husband and just fell in love with this city all over again.\nSince you\u2019re reading this post, you\u2019re probably already planning a trip to Paris, so I\u2019ll stop trying to convince you and get right into the itinerary!

Paris isn\u2019t THAT big, but the main sights are sort of spread out, so it\u2019s important to be somewhat central if you only have 3 days in Paris.\nThe city of Paris is organized into\n20 Arrondissements\n(otherwise known as neighborhoods). They are ordered from 1-20 and spiralize around the city \u2013 check out the map below to see what I mean!\nIf this is your first visit to Paris, I highly recommend staying in either the\nfourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh\narrondissement to be as central as possible. These are the neighborhoods that surround the main sites like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Notre Dame, etc.\nWhen looking at hotels, I highly recommend picking one that is within\nwalking distance of a Metro Station\n.\nI\u2019ll talk about it more in the next section, but public transportation in Paris is exceptional and will save you tons of money versus taking cabs everywhere. So, it\u2019s extremely convenient to be close to a train station!\nIn terms of hotel options, there is truly something for everyone in Paris, from hostels to luxury stays and everything in between.\nDon\u2019t stress about finding the \u201cperfect\u201d hotel\n, unless you have something very specific in mind. For example, if you NEED a balcony with a view of the Eiffel Tower, you will have to do some researching!\nBut if you\u2019re not super picky, you will have tons of options in Paris. The important thing is to pick a hotel within your budget, near a Metro station, and in a central neighborhood. Beyond that, don\u2019t stress too much.\n\u27a1\ufe0f\nRead Next:\nYou can read more about the different neighborhoods and my specific hotel recommendations in each in my guide on\nWhere to Stay in Paris for First Time Visitors!\nGetting Around + Map of the Sites\nTransportation Options\nParis has a wonderful public transportation system that is SO easy to use, even for tourists! Don\u2019t be intimated by it, even if you can\u2019t speak French.\nRATP\n(R\u00e9gie Autonome des Transport Parisiens) is the name of the entire system, which includes trains, the metro, trams, and buses.\nI highly recommend downloading\nGoogle Maps\nfor your trip, which has all the public transportation schedules built in. Just enter your location and where you need to go, and it\u2019ll show you the different options for getting there, including the easiest and the fastest.\nYou can also purchase the\nParis Visite pass\nfor your trip, which is.a card you can pre-load that includes all public transportation within the city limits. We didn\u2019t bother with this since we were only there for 2 days, but you can read more about it\nhere\n!\nNo matter what pass you decide on, just know taking public transportation will save you\na lot of money\n! If you rely solely on taxis in Paris, you will end up spending a ton of money and wasting time, so take advantage of the public transportation!\nFor example, we were trying to get from the Arc de Triomphe to our Seine River cruise. The metro station was nearby but we would\u2019ve had to walk pretty far to get to the Seine River Cruise.\nI found some free Wi-Fi and plugged in our current location and where were trying to go on Google Maps, and sure enough, there was a bus line right next to us that went straight to our destination!\nWe already had RATP tickets which can be used on the\nbus, tram, or Metro,\nso all we had to do was hop on and insert our ticket! It was so easy and saved us tons of time and money.\nDon\u2019t miss my list of\n10 Travel Tips You Need to Know Before Visiting Paris for the First Time\n! \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\nMap of the Sites\nTo make it easier to follow along on this itinerary, I created the below map of Paris for you which has all the main sites that you will hit pinned!\nYou can even export and save this map directly so you can reference it during your trip. Don\u2019t forget to \u201cDownload\u201d the map of Paris before you leave so you can access it without cell service!\nWhat to Pack for Paris\nI won\u2019t list out my whole packing list for you, because that would be excessive right?! Instead I\u2019ll give you my must haves for your trip to Paris! However, if you want\nmore details,\nyou can check out my detailed guide on\nWhat to Pack for Paris for Every Season\n!\n1. Comfy Walking Shoes\n: If you\u2019ve been to Europe before, you know that you walk A TON. Paris is no different! During our first day in Paris we walked over 15 miles\u2026 If you don\u2019t have the right shoes, you will be miserable. So make sure to pack comfy sandals or sneakers that won\u2019t give you blisters. Sneakers like\nthese\nare your best bet! Don\u2019t forget to break them in before your trip!\n2. Cross-Body Bag\n: Before you visit Paris, it\u2019s important to know that pick-pockets are prominent! They frequent tourist areas like in front of the Eiffel Tower and in the Louvre and will steal from you without you even realizing. It\u2019s important to have a small bag that always stays on your person and in front of you like\nthis one.\n3. Cute Hat and Sunglasses\n: Not totally necessary but helps with cute photos!\n4. Europe plug converter\n: If you\u2019re traveling from the USA, you will need a converter\nlike this one\nto use your electronics!\n5. Power Bank:\nYou will likely be out adventuring all day and not at your hotel much. Couple that with taking tons of photos and videos means one thing\u2026 low phone battery. I recommend buying a power bank\nlike this one\nto make sure your phone never dies!\nmy must-have travel product!\nTraveling Internationally? Make sure to purchase an eSIM before you go!\nI highly recommend simplifying your trip abroad with an eSIM through\nSim Local!\nSim Local offers\nglobal\ncoverage in over 170 countries, including multi-country passes. My favorite is their 50 GB Europe pass!\nNo more waiting in airport lines for physical SIM cards or paying for expensive roaming fees! Sim Local has you covered with\nlow prices\nand\namazing customer service.\nRead my\nfull SimLocal review here\n!\nget 10% off your esim order with code \u201clana10\u201d!\nThe Paris Pass\nIf you\u2019re spending 2 or 3 days in Paris, make sure to look into the\nParis Pass\nbefore your trip.\u00a0The Paris Pass is a combination pass that you can purchase for a flat fee of $140.\nIt gets you entrance into\nover 35 tourist attractions in Paris\n, including the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, and more. There are different passes depending on the duration of your trip (1-day, 2-day, etc.).\nThe Paris Pass\nalso allows you to\nskip the normal line\nat most attractions and/or get early entry. But make sure to do your research and confirm if it\u2019s worth purchasing! We didn\u2019t end up getting it because a 2-day pass was about $140/day and the total for the sites we wanted to visit was less than that!\nDay 1: The Louvre, Gardens, Arc de Triomphe & A Dinner Cruise\nVisiting the Louvre\nToday is your first day in the City of Lights, and it is an action-packed one!! Start the day with a pastry and cappuccino from whatever caf\u00e9 you stumble upon (there is literally one on almost every corner!). Make sure to say \u201cBonjour\u201d and \u201cMerci\u201d, but bonus points if you can order in French.\nThen it is time to head to\nthe Louvre!\n! Even if you don\u2019t like museums, the Louvre is just one of those things you have to do. I mean, you can\u2019t spend 3 days in Paris and NOT see the Mona Lisa, right?\nMake sure to reserve your\ntickets for the Louvre\nin advance.\nIf you\u2019re visiting in the summer, I recommend booking at least a month or two in advance so you can get a morning time slot. This goes for pretty much every major site in Paris.\nAt most places, like the Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe, there is a line for people with tickets and a line for people without tickets, and the one for people who don\u2019t have tickets is always INSANE. So, be proactive and buy in advance.\nAnother Pro Tip\n: There\u2019s really no need to wait in the long line for the Mona Lisa unless you ABSOLUTELY have to have a perfect picture right in front of it! Just walk to the left or right of the line and you will still be able to see it!\nDo NOT wait until you get to Paris to purchase tickets.\nGrab your Louvre tickets now\nand get the time slot you want!\n\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f\nWander on Foot\nAfter you\u2019re done at the Louvre, follow the exit signs for the\nJardin de Tuileries\n. This is a gorgeous garden right outside the grounds of the Louvre!\nYou can grab a quick bite to eat from one of the vendors in the park, or venture a few blocks away to a local caf\u00e9.\nIf the weather is nice, spend some time exploring the garden! From there, you can also walk around the River Seine and see some of the famous bridges like\nPont Alexandre III, Pont des Arts, and Pont Neuf\n.\nAs you make your way back towards Pont des Arts and Pont Neuf, you\u2019ll discover the famous \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, which translates to the Island in the Seine.\nThis is where the\nNotre Dame Cathedral\nand the\nSainte-Chapelle\nchurch are located! Spend some time admiring both churches and taking in the views from the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. Whether choose to go inside one, both, or neither, that\u2019s up to you! It\u2019s a quick 3 minute walk between the two.\nVisiting the Arc de Triomphe\nOnce you\u2019ve had your fill of churches and bridges, head back to your hotel and change for the evening. Tonight you are embarking on a dinner cruise along the Seine, so I recommend dressing up a little. However, before the dinner cruise, you will be heading to another famous site: the\nArc de Triomphe\n!\nYou can absolutely just go and see it from the ground, but I highly recommend going to the top!! I didn\u2019t even realize this was possible until recently, but it was one of my favorite parts from our trip this past summer.\nGoing to the top costs about ~\n15 euros\n, and I recommend\nbuying tickets in advance\n. (It is covered by the Paris Pass if you decide to go that route!)\nWhen you book online, you will select a time to visit \u2013 they have slots in 15-minute increments. For this itinerary, I recommend booking at slot about 2 hours before your dinner cruise (this will vary depending on the time of year!).\nGREAT TO KNOW:\nThe Arc De Triomphe is in the middle of a major intersection at the end of the famous Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es street! To get to the monument, you actually have to go underground through a tunnel! We spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out how to cross through the crazy traffic before asking a policeman how to get across\u2026 he pointed to the signs for the tunnel (stupid American moment!)\nWhen you get through the tunnel, you might see a HUGE line.. if you already have a ticket\nkeep walking\nto the front and up the little stairs until you\u2019re outside. There should be a separate (and much shorter) line for people with advanced reservations.\nThis is you. You\u2019re welcome. We only waited\nabout 5 minutes\nto start climbing the stairs!! There are elevators but I believe they are reserved for those who are physically incapable of climbing, have small children, etc.\nOnce you finish the climb, you will be rewarded with epic views of the entire city, including the Eiffel Tower! Spend some time walking around and taking it all in \u2013 there is a lot to see!\nYou can also learn more about the history of the Arc de Triomphe inside \u2013 did you know it was built to honor those who fought and died in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars?\nDON\u2019T WAIT!\nGrab your ticket to the Arc de Triomphe\nNOW in order to skip the long lines and get the time slot you want!\n\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f\nDinner Cruise Along the Seine\nAfter you\u2019re finished at the Arc de Triomphe, it\u2019s time to make your way towards the river for your dinner cruise! If your cruise leaves from\nPont de l\u2019Alma Bridge\n, you can hop right on the\n#92 bus to the Alma \u2013 Marceau stop!\nWe booked our dinner cruise through\nBateaux Mouches\n, and I highly recommend them!! They operate a few different dinner cruises, but I highly recommend the\nRomantic Dinner Cruise\nthat leaves later in the evening.\nWe almost booked the \u201cearly bird\u201d one because it was much cheaper, but then I realized how late the sun sets in the summer in Paris! Our boat left around 8pm, and the sunset was around 9pm.\nTrust me, you don\u2019t want to miss the sunset from the boat!!\nTo start, they give you a little card that shows all the historic sites you will see along the way. The boat cruises along the Seine, first south towards\nNotre Dame and the Louvre.\nThen, you\u2019ll get to see the sunset from the river and get the fabulous golden hour lighting, but that\u2019s not even the highlight!\nThe boat is timed perfectly so that you are right\nin front of the Eiffel Tower\nwhen the lights turn on at dusk, followed shortly after by its first sparkling light show on the hour.\nWe took our drinks and went to the roof at this point and got to watch the Eiffel Tower sparkle right in front of our eyes.\nIt was seriously magical.\nYou can read more about different cruises available and which is the best option for you in my full\nParis Dinner Cruises Guide here\n!\nThe boat docks back around 10:30pm-11:00pm. If you still have energy, I highly recommend strolling towards the Eiffel Tower along the Seine. This area completely\ncomes alive at night,\nand you can catch a few more sparkling shows!\nIf you make it until 1am, you\u2019re rewarded with a unique viewing where all the lights on the Tower turn off and the entire thing is covered in sparkles!! A sight not to miss!\nDay 2: Day trip Outside the City + Dinner show\nIf you have 3 days in Paris, I highly recommend spending a half day getting out of the city and visiting one of the many famous sites right outside! We chose Versailles, which is what I will dive into in this itinerary. However, here are some other awesome options for\nday trips outside of Paris\n!\n1. GIVERNY, WHERE MONET LIVED AND PAINTED\n2. CHAMPAGNE, NEED I SAY MORE?\n3. NORMANDY, IF YOU LIKE HISTORY\n4. BRUGES, THE VENICE OF BELGIUM!\n5. MONT SAINT-MICHEL, AN INCREDIBLE ISLAND VILLAGE\nDay Trip to Versailles\nVersailles is another famous site that you absolutely need to\nreserve tickets for in advance\n! Again, I highly recommend looking at least a month before your trip. You will need to select a time slot for entry \u2013 I recommend grabbing the\nearliest option so you can avoid the crowds and crazy lines.\nWe booked our tickets very close to our trip and got an 11am time slot, and the lines were already crazy by the time we arrived. So.. the earlier the better!\nGetting to Versailles is actually very easy, even for tourists! To get there, you can take one of the \u201cRER\u201d trains. These are basically commuter trains that run from the middle of Paris to the outskirts. The\nRER C train\n(yellow line) runs directly from Paris to Versailles, which makes it impossible to mess up!\nYou can get on the RER C train from multiple different spots throughout Paris, like the Champ de Mars station next to the Eiffel Tower or the Saint-Michel Notre Dame station!\nYou can read my full guide on taking a\nDay Trip from Paris to Versailles\nto learn more about transportation options, ticket options, and how to spend your day!\nOnce you arrive at the Versailles Train Station (River-Gauche), just follow the crowds! Nearly everyone will be headed to the same place. There is a small little town outside the palace with shops to grab breakfast at as well. We found some delicious crepes here before heading inside!\nBetween the gardens and the palace,\nVersailles can easily fill your entire day.\nBelow is a map of Versailles so you can get a feel for all there is (it\u2019s not just a palace!) The grounds are absolutely massive.\nSome top things to see include the inside of the Palace (based on your timed-entry), Marie Antoinette\u2019s estate, and the vibrant gardens.\nIf I could go back and do it again, I think I would book an\norganized tour of Versailles\nsince there is SO much to see and do here. We kind of wandered around and definitely weren\u2019t as prepared as we should\u2019ve been!! Guided tours are also a great way to\nskip the lines!\nAnother great option is to\nrent bikes at Versailles\n. The grounds are MASSIVE (part of the reason it\u2019s impossible to do it all in one day), so bikes allow you to get around faster and see more!\nYou can also book\na guided bike tour of Versailles\n\u2013 best of both worlds!\nDinner Show in the City\nOnce you\u2019re finished at Versailles, it\u2019s time to head back into the city for another evening of fun! If you want to eat dinner before heading back to Paris, there are some great restaurants right outside the palace. We ate at Le Saint Claire and it was yummy!\nOnce you\u2019re back in the city, I recommend spending the evening\nbar hopping in the Latin Quarter\n. This is a super fun neighborhood with different cocktail and wine bars.\nOr if you are looking for something more exciting, you can\u2019t go wrong with\nseeing a burlesque show\nlike\nMoulin Rouge\n, Lido or Crazy Horse! Because what\u2019s more iconic than seeing a French cabaret show in Paris?!\nMake sure to check out my list of\n19 things to do in Paris at night\nfor even more ideas!\nDay 3: Montmartre & Picnic at the Eiffel Tower\nExploring Montmartre\nToday is your last day in Paris, and I recommend heading to the quaint little neighborhood of Montmartre. If you went to the top of the Arc de Triomphe, you probably saw the most famous Montmartre landmark, the\nSacr\u00e9-Coeur Basilica.\nIt stands out high on a hill above Paris, and it is totally worth a visit!\nIn addition to the Basilica, you\u2019ll find adorable cobblestone streets and fabulous eateries in Montmartre. It\u2019s the perfect place to spend your morning wandering around, and it actually feels totally different from the rest of Paris.\nIf you\u2019re looking for something fun to do in Montmartre, consider booking this\nMontmartre Food Walking Tour\n!\nOn this 3 hour tour, you\u2019ll get to experience the best of Paris\u2019s culinary delights, everything from crepes, cheese, cured meats to wine and macarons!\nSounds like heaven to me!!\nBook it here!\nPicnic at the Champs de Mars\nOnce you\u2019ve had your fill of Montmartre, head back into the city center and spend time exploring any other areas that you missed!\u00a0This is the perfect time to explore some\nParis hidden gems\nlike Place des Vosges or Parc de Belleville.\nAnd to finish your last day in Paris, of course we are going to spend the evening at the Eiffel Tower!\nFirst,\nhead to the nearest market or grocery store\nand pick up some fruit, cheese, bread, wine, and whatever else tickles your fancy!! Bring a blanket or kimono from home so you don\u2019t have to buy one, then make your way to the Champs de Mars!\nThe\nChamps de Mars\nis a large grassy area right in front of the Eiffel Tower where people sit and picnic (it\u2019s linked on the map at the beginning of this post!). Find an empty spot on the lawn and enjoy!\nI recommend trying to arrive around an hour before sunset\nso you can see all the different views of the Eiffel Tower. First at golden hour right before sunset, then the sunset itself, then blue hour, then darkness!! They are all magic in their own way.\nNote\n: The sunset time will depend on what time of year you are visiting! When we were visiting in late May, the sunset wasn\u2019t until 9:45pm!!\nAnd of course the Eiffel Tower will change too. Around dusk, the Eiffel Tower automatically lights up with golden lighting. Then, on the first hour after dusk (9:00pm, 10:00pm, etc.) the Tower sparkles for 5 minutes.\nIt is pure magic.\nThat view will be totally different from the one an hour later, as the next one will be completely dark outside!!

The cobblestone streets in Montmartre. Wandering Le Marais. Relaxing on the banks of the Seine or under the Eiffel Tower.\nWith four days, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll comfortably be able to fit in the two big museums (the Louvre and Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay), the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe, and a day trip to Versailles.\nThis itinerary is meant to help you see the best of the city without needing a vacation from your vacation.\nIf you have more time, we have recommendations below in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore time\u00e2\u0080\u009d section on how to spend it.\nHowever, you could also just pick a neighborhood and spend a day wandering from shop to shop, coffee to coffee, wine bar to wine bar. That sounds like a perfect day in Paris to us.\nWhere to Stay in Paris\nThe first thing you need to know here is that there are a nearly unlimited number of places you\ncould\nstay in Paris.\nParis is divided into neighborhoods called\narrondissements\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 each has its own history and personality.\nIf you look at the city map, imagine a snail\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shell coming out from the very center and circling clockwise and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get the logic behind the numbers.\nWe have an entire guide dedicated to choosing a\nplace to stay in Paris\n, which you should read for far more detail than we have in this summary.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a quick summary of that guide if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re short on time (though we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend reading the section of the place you end up staying for tips and places to add to your list!).\nIf it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your first time in Paris, our recommendation is that you stay in\nLe Marais\n, the heart of medieval Paris\n. This is Paris at its best, we think, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about as central as it gets. You have excellent walkability to basically every main site in Paris, the best transit connections in the city (including to the airport), and many of Paris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 best places to eat, drink, and shop right outside your front door. Plus, a bunch of hotels (though, as you might imagine, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not cheap!). In Le Marais, stay at the (relatively) affordable\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel National Des Arts et M\u00c3\u00a9tiers\n, or\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel Jules & Jim\nif you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for one of the best hotels in Paris.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a cool neighborhood with lots of food and drinks, stay in the\n2nd Arrondissement\n, a new personal favorite after one of our recent trips. If we were moving to Paris, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d move to Sentier, a slice of the 2nd near all of our favorites in the neighborhood. The 2nd is adjacent to Le Marais, and offers many of the same benefits with a slightly lower price tag (generally speaking). Stay at\nLe 123 S\u00c3\u00a9bastopol\n, which might just be the best value in the entire city of Paris, or at\nCitizenM Op\u00c3\u00a9ra\n(CitizenM is one of our favorite hotel chains in the world, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stayed at multiple locations across multiple countries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 highly recommend!).\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on a budget and looking for a blend of affordability and convenience, stay in the\n9th Arrondissement\n, which is central and affordable with great nightlife. For what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth, we stayed in the 9th on two recent trips (first at the super affordable\nHotel Joyce\n, then at the excellent\nMaison M\u00c3\u00a8re\n), and it was a great home base for exploring the city. Plus, a bunch of our favorite wine bars / coffee shops / restaurants in Paris turned out to be in the 9th (or on the border), which is another major pro for staying here.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a romantic getaway\n, you should absolutely stay in\nMontmartre\n(the 18th Arr.), where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find cobblestone streets and a former village \u00e2\u0080\u0093 home to many of the most famous artists in history like Van Gogh, Renoir, and Picasso \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on a hill above Paris that has since been swallowed up by the ever-expanding city. It has all the charm of a medieval village straight out of a fairy tale, but the location up on the hill is a little further out than some people might prefer (especially if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shorter trip). I splurged at\nTerrass\non my latest trip in one of their Eiffel Tower view rooms, and it was MAGICAL (but not cheap). For a more budget-friendly option, look at\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel Monsieur Aristide\nor\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel des Arts Montmartre\n.\nThe view from my room at Terrass in Montmartre!\nRead More:\nWhere to Stay in Paris (Complete Guide for First Timers)\nImportant Tips for Visiting Paris\nDuring your trip to Paris, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come across some of the clich\u00c3\u00a9s about Parisians, as well as some specific French lifestyle elements that are worth knowing about.\nSet Your Expectations\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing about Paris. Paris is very, very polarizing.\nSome people rave about it and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get enough of it. Some people come back from their first trip to Paris and say it was underwhelming and that French people are surly and mean.\nI think it all comes down to expectations.\nParis is not a city in a fairytale, which I think is what many first-time visitors build it up to be.\nThey have this romantic ideal in their head, where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re strolling by the Seine with a red beret on their head, hand in hand with their lover on their way to a cozy bistro for dinner.\nWhile that can certainly exist in Paris, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaving out the part where there are cars honking, you just stepped in dog poop and are frantically trying to wipe it off on a leaf or the curb, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running late because the metro was delayed.\nThe romantic ideal of Paris is forgetting that Paris is a real city, a city full of tourists, and a big city, which means it has its fair share of problems.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little dirty (not as clean as Seville or Madrid, not as dirty as Rome), it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little crowded (especially on the metro at peak times), and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that sometimes, Parisians can come off as unfriendly.\nBut on the other hand, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an amazing city full of world-class art museums, a pretty great food scene, romantic neighborhoods full of narrow cobblestone streets like Montmartre, and tons of history and culture to dive into and learn more about.\nIf there are two things I want you to know before you go to Paris, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s these two\n.\nFirst\n, remember that Paris is a real city, and that the people living there are real people. There are great things about Paris, and there are annoying things about Paris.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do our best to help you see the great things and minimize the annoying things. Or at least be aware of them going in.\nSecond\n, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to fit it all in. Trust me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done that trip. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve run around from museum to museum, and seen it all, but absorbed almost none of it.\nInstead, focus on a couple of main attractions (we think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay, and the Rodin Museum) and save some time to connect with locals on a walking tour, food tour, or cooking class to learn more about what makes Paris tick.\nLearn Some French \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A Little Goes a Long Way!\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be put off by the myth that Parisians are rude and unaccommodating to tourists.\u00a0Generally speaking, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an outdated idea, and it usually comes from someone who hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been to Paris in a decade or two.\nThe reality is that it basically comes down to a mismatch of expectations (again) around manners.\nSpecifically, greetings.\nYou need to make sure to greet everyone before you get into the interaction! For example, saying bonjour before ordering coffee from a barista.\nAs long as you greet everyone with a smile and a\nBonjour\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is perhaps the most important part! \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and make sure to be polite, most locals we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve encountered have been absolutely lovely.\nIt will help if you learn a few important French phrases.\nIn our experience, people are always happier when you make an effort to use their own language. Not just in France, but just about everywhere in the world.\nHere are some useful phrases to learn, and my attempt at phonetic spelling.\nBonjour\n(bone \u00e2\u0080\u0093 jure) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 hello / good day\nS\u00e2\u0080\u0099il vous pla\u00c3\u00aet\n(seal voo play) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 please (\u00e2\u0080\u009cif you please\u00e2\u0080\u009d, literally)\nMerci\n(mare \u00e2\u0080\u0093 see) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thank you\nJe voudrais\n(jeuh voo \u00e2\u0080\u0093 dray) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I would like (this is the polite way of saying it, I think)\nPardon\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 (par \u00e2\u0080\u0093 do) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 excuse me\nExcusez-moi\n(excuse \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ay mwah ) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 excuse me (different way to say it)\nD\u00c3\u00a9sol\u00c3\u00a9e\n(dez \u00e2\u0080\u0093 oh \u00e2\u0080\u0093 lay) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sorry\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nmore comprehensive guide\nto French phrases to learn, or you could pick up a small French phrasebook to help you learn French as you go.\nThe Crowds Are Going to Be Intense (There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s No Real \u00e2\u0080\u009cLow\u00e2\u0080\u009d Season)\nAfter a recent trip to Paris in November, I talked to multiple guides, restaurant owners, and baristas, and they all said some version of the same thing: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is no low or shoulder season anymore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis is true of most of the main cities in Europe, and certainly applies to Paris: the age of shoulder seasons that have meaningfully lower crowds is a thing of the past.\nHowever, the one thing I would say is that the makeup of the crowds changes by the season (for example, you see more kids and families in the spring and summer, and more young people and retirees in the fall).\nI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to show up in Paris at any time and find it quiet (except, ironically, during the Olympics, which almost every Parisian I talked to said was relatively quiet, in a bad way for tourist-centric businesses).\nMy point is that there is no time when you can visit the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, or the Arc de Triomphe and have them to yourself.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not going to happen. Even in November, the lines to access the Louvre were wild (though less wild than, say, July).\nI talked to multiple people in the tourist industry, and generally the lowest seasons are November (when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely to be gray and drizzly, which I can personally confirm) and January/February (when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more likely to be colder, but you also tend to get more blue skies).\nMarch to October (and December for Christmas)? Busy busy busy.\nNow, here are three things you can do to avoid crowds, to the extent that it is possible.\nWalk around key spots \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like Montmartre or along the Seine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 before 8am or after 10pm (ish)\nPre-book main attractions to avoid missing out on experiences.\nBook tours that offer off peak times (early morning or night tours)\nBook Your Big Attractions in Advance\nOne thing that can be confusing, especially if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your first time in Paris or in a big European city, is that there are often two separate lines at most main tourist attractions: the line for the ticket office, and the line for security.\nA pro-tip here is that\nyou can completely bypass the line for the ticket office at most major tourist attractions by booking a timed entry slot in advance\n.\nHowever, there are two considerations to keep in mind here.\nOne, booking in advance obviously means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sacrificing flexibility, which may or may not be something you care about.\nBut think about it this way: by booking a Louvre timeslot in advance, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely saving yourself a couple of hours of waiting in line at the ticket office. Which seems worth it if your time is limited!\nThis is really only important when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weather-related, I think. You might not want to go to Versailles on a gray, rainy day if you know it might be sunny on a different day.\nTwo, some popular attractions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like the Louvre and Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have a limited number of slots available on a given day, and they will sell out online in advance.\nIf that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the case for your dates, then you have two options: book a tour that includes entry, or show up on the day of and wait in line at the ticket office (they usually have tickets set aside for walk up, but the lines can be long).\nHere are the attractions I would put in that \u00e2\u0080\u009cbook in advance\u00e2\u0080\u009d category:\nThe Louvre\nMus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay\nThe Arc de Triomphe\nNotre Dame\nThe Orangerie\nThe Picasso Museum\nSainte Chappelle\nOther attractions, like the Pantheon or Rodin Museum, can generally be booked online a few days in advance (which will save you time by avoiding the ticket office line), or on the day of.\nOther Things to Know About Visiting Paris\nHere are some other things to know going in that we jotted down on our latest trip. Some are useful, some are funny, some are good to know, and we hope that all of them will help you have a more enjoyable trip.\nMany shops and convenience stores are\nclosed on Sundays\nso check hours in advance. Even grocery stores and other places you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect to be open if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming from the US or Canada.\nSimilarly, museums and places of interest typically\nhave a day a week when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re closed\n, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not always the same. Check before you go.\nParis is MASSIVE\n. We spent the first day or two trying to walk everywhere, and after multiple 30,000 step days decided to use the metro. With limited time, get acquainted with the metro and bus system, which will allow you to get around much more efficiently. We used\nthis app\nfor navigating the metro. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well worth investing in a\nVisite Pass\n, which gives you unlimited bus and metro rides (you only need zones 1-3, really).\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still going to be doing a lot of walking on this itinerary, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to watch where you step because\nthere is dog poop\neverywhere\n.\nWear comfortable shoes\n, and leave the heels at home. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of cobblestones and uneven footing in Paris, and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing a lot of walking, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want your feet to be comfortable.\nEverybody in Paris smokes\n. Or it seems that way to us. It has to be at least 50% of adults. Anytime you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re eating or drinking outside, there is almost guaranteed to be someone smoking nearby. Good to know going in.\nTipping isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much of a thing\n. Servers in Paris get paid a living wage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 something we should probably consider in the US (don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t @ me with \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut small businesses\u00e2\u0080\u009d) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and tipping is more about rewarding good service than a requirement so the server can pay rent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still nice to give a 5-10% tip at sit-down restaurants with good service, and you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a receipt with a tip line \u00e2\u0080\u0093 either tip in cash, or tell them the final amount you want to pay before they run your card (e.g. if the bill is 50 Euros and you want to tip 5, tell them \u00e2\u0080\u009c55 Euros, s\u00e2\u0080\u0099il vous pla\u00c3\u00aet\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\nRead More:\nEssential Paris Travel Tips for First Timers (coming soon)\n4 Days in Paris: A Perfect Itinerary for First Timers\nAnd now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get into the meat of this itinerary.\nWe have a secret for you. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lesson that it took us years of traveling to finally learn on our three month European extravaganza a few years ago.\nTravel is better \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and by better, we mean more rewarding, interesting, and fun \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when you try your best to connect with locals to see the place through their eyes.\nI (Matt here!) took that to heart on my last visit to Paris in an effort to better understand what makes the city special, and came away with a much richer understanding of Paris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unique culture and point of view on life.\nParticularly on that latest trip, I did a bunch of different tours and experiences (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve included the ones that I thought were particularly special in the guide below) that opened my eyes to a new side of the city, culture, and people.\nOur biggest tip for Paris (or any city, really) is to prioritize tours that connect you with locals and allow you to get a unique perspective on the city (which is what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see in this itinerary).\nIn terms of structure, we always do our best to anchor the days in our itineraries around a main experience, with time on either side for things like coffee, cocktails, and good old fashioned wandering around a neighborhood.\nAnd we never, ever do multiple museums in a single day\n.\nTrust us and learn from our mistakes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you WILL be exhausted by the time you get to the second one, and will get a lot less out of it.\nWith so much to experience in Paris, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely tempting to try to pack in all the sights, but then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much time to \u00e2\u0080\u009clive like a Parisian\u00e2\u0080\u009d. And that would be a shame.\nTo make the most out of Paris, plan to do one or two major sights a day, and dedicate the rest to walking around the neighborhoods while leaving yourself energy to go out for a drink and some dancing or live entertainment in the evenings.\nWhat to Book in Advance:\nIn general, to make sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually able to make it to some of the top sights in Paris,\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend booking 2-3 months in advance for the Louvre, Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay, the Eiffel Tower (if you want to go to the top), and Versailles\n.\nThis is particularly important if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re visiting over the summer, when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen crazy lines for some of Paris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 top sights, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less important in the off-season (though we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still book the Louvre in advance).\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an overview of the 4 day itinerary you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find below:\nDay 1:\nThe Left Bank, Saint-Germain, and the Eiffel Tower\nDay 2:\nGothic Churches, the Louvre, and the Arc de Triomphe\nDay 3:\nThe Coolest Neighborhoods in Paris and a Foodie Experience\nDay 4:\nA Day Trip to Versailles\nBelow the detailed itinerary, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find some suggestions on what to do with more or less time on your trip to Paris, including options for compressing this itinerary into one, two, or three days.\nA few things to note about the itinerary we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to get into.\nWe believe pretty strongly that\nyou should skip going to the top of the Eiffel Tower\n, and have a few different places where you can get a better (we think) view of Paris for far less hassle. Instead, picnic at the base and walk across the river to Trocadero for nice views of the tower.\nWe also believe that\nthe Champs-\u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es\n, while a beautiful wide boulevard that is emblematic of Paris,\nis just about the least \u00e2\u0080\u009cParisian\u00e2\u0080\u009d place imaginable\n. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full of multinational chains that you could find in literally any big European city. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spend more than 30 minutes on the Champs-\u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es. The Arc de Triomphe, however, is great!\nMany museums and attractions have a day that they are closed\n(for example, the Louvre is closed on Tuesdays), so plan accordingly.\nMany museums have a night where they are open late\n, which allows for locals to enjoy them after work. This is a great time to visit, but it depends on what else you have going on in your itinerary.\nAnother note here at the top:\nThis itinerary is jam-packed!\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a ton to do and see (and eat, and drink) in Paris, and fitting it all into four days is impossible.\nTo that end, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made some hard choices (like the choice not to bother going up the Eiffel Tower) that are based on our own experiences in Paris in an effort to help you maximize your time and enjoyment.\nOne of those choices is to include Versailles in the itinerary\n, rather than in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore time\u00e2\u0080\u009d section. To be honest, we could go either way.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d prefer adding Versailles only if you have five days or more, but we think you can fit it into four if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to skip some other things, like a walking tour about the French revolution or a visit to an additional museum.\nLast, but certainly not least,\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to give specific recommendations on places to eat for two reasons\n.\nOne, Matt has Celiac Disease and French food is absolutely TERRIBLE if you need to eat gluten free (there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flour or bread in everything!), so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not really the right people to give that advice (except for the best\ngluten free restaurants in Paris\n, which we have plenty of opinions about).\nTwo, it depends so much on your tastes and budget. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let you figure that out on your own, for the most part.\nDay 1: Exploring the Left Bank\nOn your first full day in Paris, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d skip the Louvre (save it for a day when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re less jetlagged) and get oriented to the city by exploring the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeft Bank\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the Seine, which refers to the south side of the river (and is a very common way that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hear people talk about Paris).\nA quick side note on the two banks.\nThe names, which can be confusing if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know this already, are derived from which side of the river they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking downriver (or, put another way, in the direction that the river flows).\nThe Seine flows through Paris from east to west, so if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking west down the river, the 5th, 6th, and 7th Arrondissements are on the left side, while the 1st \u00e2\u0080\u0093 4th Arrondissements are on the right side.\nHistorically speaking, the left bank has been known as the more creative, philosophical side of the river, where artists, writers, and revolutionaries hung out, while the right bank is the more aristocratic side, where the royal palace and the associated court was located.\nToday, that stereotype is less true than a couple hundred years ago, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d almost say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flipped if you look at the 6th and 7th Arr., where housing is basically occupied by rich foreigners at this point.\nAnyway, the first day is focused on the Left Bank, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work your way from east to west, starting in the Latin Quarter (the 5th Arr.), hitting our favorite museum in Paris, and ending in the 7th Arr. at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.\nThe Latin Quarter\nThe Latin Quarter is our favorite part of Paris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Left Bank (at least of the arrondissements along the river).\nWhile the 6th and 7th feel very stuffy and, for lack of a better word, aristocratic, the 5th (which is the Latin Quarter) is a little more lived in.\nI stayed here on my latest trip for almost a week, and was surprised at how often I encountered people that actually lived in the neighborhood while I was out and about (which is certainly less true in just about every other arrondissement in the single digits).\nHaving a neighborhood that is \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore local\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a little bit of a stereotype, and I did some thinking while I was wandering around Paris solo about what this really means.\nTo me, it means that people actually live there and so you have a range of businesses catering to those locals rather than a string of souvenir shops geared towards tourists with the exact same Eiffel Tower snowglobes that they imported from elsewhere.\nThat means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re swapping those souvenir shops for a boulangerie, fromagerie, coffee shop, wine bar, bistro, and other places that I \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and people like me \u00e2\u0080\u0093 would actually want to hang out. Which is great!\nThe 5th has that in droves, along with two key spots that you definitely shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss.\nThe first, and your first stop on the trip, is the\nJardin du Luxembourg\n, which is our personal favorite of the many green spaces in central Paris (and it was created in the 17th century!).\nWe have been known to stop by a (gluten free) bakery nearby to pick up some pastries and head over to the gardens to bask in the warm sun, surrounded by greenery, fountains, sculptures, and people with a similar idea (including the old men playing P\u00c3\u00a9tanque, which is kind of like bocce ball).\nTechnically, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the 6th, but as you walk to the eastern side of the park you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be in the perfect position to wander up towards your next stop.\nThat next stop?\nThe Panth\u00c3\u00a9on\n.\nWhich, unlike the Panth\u00c3\u00a9on that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find in Rome, is not a pagan or Catholic religious site (it was at one point, but not today!), but is the burial site of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whatever that means.\nOriginally, this was set to be a church, which is fairly obvious from the structure of the building from the outside.\nBut as it was completed, the French Revolution had descended on Paris. One of the tenets of the French Revolution was breaking away from the Catholic Church as the ultimate power source (e.g. the divine right of kings), and so the church was rebranded into a mausoleum.\nVictor Hugo, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Voltaire are examples of said \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat men\u00e2\u0084\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u009d buried here.\nWhile the interior is cool, the real reason that the Panth\u00c3\u00a9on is on this itinerary \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and why it is specifically in the morning \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is that the dome offers a great view out over the rest of Paris.\nAnd it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best in the morning, when the sun is at your back and not directly overhead or behind the Eiffel Tower in the distance.\nThe Panth\u00c3\u00a9on opens at 10am, so our recommendation is to take a nice morning walk through the gardens (maybe with a pastry and some coffee from a bakery nearby), and then walk up to Panth\u00c3\u00a9on to be there around opening, when the light will be best for photos.\nYou should know, however, that\nthe dome of the Panth\u00c3\u00a9on closes during the winter\n(I know because it closed a couple of days before I tried to go in mid-November!).\nWe probably wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go inside if this is the case, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to you and your interests. There will be plenty of other church-like buildings on the rest of this itinerary.\nAnother note:\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an extra few Euros to include the dome in your ticket. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do it, because the view from the dome is a big part of the reason it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on this itinerary.\nFrom there, make your way west through Saint-Germain, the 6th Arrondissement, out to the river for your next stop.\nA Crash Course in Impressionism at the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay\nWhile the Louvre is the most impressive museum in Paris in terms of its size and scope, the award for our favorite museum in the city has to go to the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay (although the Rodin Museum is a close second!).\nNow, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re definitely not saying that the Louvre isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worth seeing (you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find it on day two of this itinerary).\nBut we ARE saying that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a somewhat overwhelming and intimidating collection.\nAnd I just really love the impressionists, who were very much the bad boys (and a few ladies, too!) of the art world in their heyday.\nFunny enough, the two museums are very much related \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the collection that lives at the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay today was originally housed at the Louvre before it was moved here when the train station was decommissioned (the building used to be a train station before Paris outgrew it).\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a sucker for landscapes and bright colors, which puts me right in the bullseye for the target audience of the Impressionists.\nI had been to the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay twice before my most recent trip to Paris, but it had been a decade since my last visit and I felt like it was time to revisit what I remembered as my favorite museum in Paris.\nOne of the biggest learnings about myself over the past few years of traveling is that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really bad at doing art museums by myself. I really need the context and storytelling to capture my interest and help me understand what exactly I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking at.\nWhich is why I decided to do\nCarine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tour of the museum\n, which I had tried to set up on my previous solo trip to Paris, but our availability didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t overlap.\nCarine was GREAT. She studied art history at the \u00c3\u0089cole du Louvre, which seems like the perfect person to teach about Impressionism and its rise in France.\nOver a couple of hours, she weaved a story that truly captured my attention.\nShe positioned the impressionists as the bad boys of their era who challenged norms and expectations in the Parisian art world, which was ruled by stuffy salons, to forge their own path and do what they wanted rather than what was expected of them.\nImportant note: Her tour DOES NOT include a ticket\n, so you will have to book a timed entry ticket for the time of the tour (she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you more information on this).\nAs you make your way through the museum, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to enjoy some of the best impressionist art ever created. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feast your eyes on C\u00c3\u00a9zanne, Degas, Monet, Van Gogh, and many others.\nIf you visit on your own, make sure not to miss the\nBal du Moulin de la Galette\nby Pierre-August Renoir with its energetic, lively atmosphere of a ball in Montmartre, Edouard Manet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quizzical\nOlympia\n, Vincent Van Gogh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nStarry Night\n(if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on display), and Claude Monet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nBlue Water Lilies.\nThough my favorite discovery was Pissarro, whose use of color captured my eye from across the room.\nAnd the incredible use of light in Monet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early\nLa Pie (The Magpie)\n, which depicts a winter landscape with sunlight poking through the bare trees and dancing across the snowy landscape.\nIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do the tour with Carine, I highly recommend the audio guide to give you at least a little bit of the context and history. And book your tickets in advance to skip the ticket line!\nHow to Visit:\nAs usual with the main attractions in Paris, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth booking your visit in advance so that you can skip the ticket line (you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still have to wait in the security line). Make your reservation\nhere\n. The museum is closed on Mondays. If you want a quieter visit, go on Thursday evening, when the museum is open until 9:45pm.\nSee the Eiffel Tower Up Close\nLook, if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being completely honest, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really think you should go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.\nIt reminds us a lot of the Space Needle in Matt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hometown of Seattle in the sense that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expensive \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in this case, both in terms of money and time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s missing a key element of the skyline\u00e2\u0080\u00a6the Eiffel Tower!\nWe have a couple of other suggestions for views of Paris that include the Eiffel Tower, and we would recommend skipping going to the top, instead focusing on the park at the base and the many views of the tower you can find from vantage points nearby.\nThere are two things we think you should do at the Eiffel Tower that are completely free.\nThe first is a\npicnic in the Champs de Mars\n, which is the park that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the base of the tower.\nAfter the museum, stop by the best grocery store on the Left Bank \u00e2\u0080\u0093 La Grande \u00c3\u0089picerie de Paris (\nhere\non Google Maps) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for some fresh bread, cheese and charcuterie, and perhaps a bottle of wine or some beer.\nSeriously, that grocery store is, yes, very fancy, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a JOY to shop in and discover some new, interesting foods to try.\nFrom there, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a short walk to the Eiffel Tower.\nAt the park at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find a huge group of people enjoying the view on warm sunny days in Paris.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some great people watching to be had here, including the people selling buckets of booze who have an intricate system designed to help them evade the police, who show up every once in a while. This is probably in the top 3 in terms of experiences in Paris.\nThe second thing we think you should do is\nwalk over to the other side of the Seine, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find two worthwhile spots with excellent views of the Eiffel Tower\n.\nFirst is the view from slightly above at the\nJardins du Trocad\u00c3\u00a9ro\n(\nhere\non Google Maps). Second is the view of the Eiffel tower from the water level from\nhere\n.\nAs you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re walking around the Champs de Mars, be aware of your surroundings. Pickpockets are common in this part of the city, and you want to keep an eye on your belongings (no phones or wallets in back pockets, people!).\nThe other thing to be aware of is the scams that are shell games and other informal gambling.\nAs you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re walking around, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely to see multiple iterations of this phenomenon, and you should know that the games are rigged against you, and that there are more people involved in the scam than you think (including many of the other players.\nIn the grand scheme of things, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you need to spend that much time at the Eiffel Tower itself, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be better off spending your time elsewhere.\nWe will say that it is worth seeing the light show that the Eiffel Tower puts on for five minutes at the top of every hour after dark (until 11pm, usually).\nThe start times change with the season \u00e2\u0080\u0093 obviously, there are more hours after dark in the winter than in the summer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and\nthis is a good reference\nto read. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to know what time the sun sets.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d watch it from the platform at the Jardins du Trocad\u00c3\u00a9ro just across the river, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to be there a bit early to snag a spot.\nBut what if you want to go to the top?\nWell, you have a few options to get to the top \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can take elevators to the second floor viewing deck or all the way to the top, or tackle it on foot up to the second floor platform, which involves more than 1,500 steps in total (and saves about 30% on tickets).\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to get tickets either way and we recommend\nbooking tickets online\nto avoid huge lines at the ticket office.\nBe prepared for long security lines at basically all times \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cskip the line\u00e2\u0080\u009d means you skip the ticket line, but everyone has to go through the security line.\nIf you want to go all the way to the top, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d book several weeks in advance because they do sell out.\nDive into the World of French Wine (with Erwan)\nThis is an important one for wine lovers. For a combination of many reasons, French wine just hits differently than wine from the new world.\nMy somewhat educated opinion is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roughly equal parts centuries of farming and winemaking expertise and the fact that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on vacation, so everything just tastes a little bit better.\nHowever, on my latest trip, I had a bit of a realization about wine in France.\nIt has to do with how wine lists are organized differently than we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re used to here in the U.S., and it means that many Americans on their first trip to Paris end up extremely confused when they sit down at their first dinner and try to order wine.\nThe reason? There is not a single mention of wine varietals on a French wine list.\nIn the U.S., when you go to order wine, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re generally ordering it by varietal, like Cabernet Sauvignon or Sauvignon Blanc.\nIn France, things are organized by region and even city, without a single mention of what grape you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ordering.\nIn fact, if you look at a typical French wine list, you will not see a single mention of a grape varietal.\nThe reason is actually fairly simple (though I still think it would be helpful to know the grape varietals too!): The French believe in the concept of terroir.\nThe idea that the soil, elevation, and climate of the place imparts inherent characteristics on the wine, and that a grape varietal grown in, say, Australia is going to taste different from the same varietal grown in France.\nThe idea of place is the most important thing that creates the wine in the bottle, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what they lead with.\nHowever, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming from our American paradigm and approach, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extremely confusing, because how the heck am I supposed to know what the wine in Sancerre or Bourgogne is like?\nWell, you have to taste them!\nIf you care about finding what kinds of French wine you like (and what you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t) and aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already familiar with French wine, I highly recommend investing in a wine tasting experience where an expert walks you through the main wine regions in France, and guides you through a tasting of them.\nIf you want to make sure to drink great wine during your trip, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d highly recommend scheduling one of those experiences for your first night to set you up for success for the rest of your trip.\nI know this, because I did two on my latest trip, and despite being generally familiar with a couple of regions, I learned that I like wines from Sancerre (sauvignon blanc), other whites from the Loire Valley (like the chenin blanc from Saumur), and that I can get on board with reds from Languedoc.\nI did two tastings, and they turned out to be fairly different approaches to the same thing.\nThe first was\nthis tasting at a wine bar in the 1st\n, which was led by a sommelier and was a little more heavy on the educational piece (though still very interesting and engaging!). They also have\nan earlier time slot\nif you want a lunchtime wine extravaganza.\nThe second was\na wine and cheese tasting\nin the 7th with Erwan, which was much more casual and low key (and I really enjoyed Erwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story and approach!). He pairs five wines with five French cheeses, all of which were excellent.\nI enjoyed both (and the wines were all great), and it comes down to what kind of approach you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for.\nFor the purposes of this itinerary, though, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d highly recommend Erwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s session\nbecause it is right near the Eiffel Tower, making it an easy addition to your first evening either before or after the tower (it depends on the time of year).\nDay 2: \u00c3\u008ele de la Cit\u00c3\u00a9 and the Right Bank\nOn your second day, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ideally be a little more well rested, bright eyed, and bushy tailed, head to the right bank for an action-packed day.\nBut First, Coffee\nThe area near \u00c3\u008ele de la Cit\u00c3\u00a9 is home to a couple of my favorite\ncoffee shops in Paris\n, but\nMotors Coffee\nwould be my top choice for starting your day off with good coffee and a delicious homemade pastry.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a five minute walk or so to Notre Dame and Sainte-Chappelle, and they bring in some of the best coffees from around the world to brew at their compact shop on the border of Le Marais and the 1st Arrondissement.\nI came here multiple times on my latest trip to Paris, and I was sitting at the seat next to the stairs, where cinnamon and other baking spices were wafting up from the kitchen below.\nGrab a coffee, a pastry, and a seat on their terrace out front to set yourself up for an action-packed day ahead.\n\u00c3\u008ele de la Cit\u00c3\u00a9 and a Tale of Two Churches\nThe relatively small island in the middle of the Seine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is a natural island, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t man made \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find two of Paris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 best and most well known churches.\nOne is the religious center of the city, and the other is the former royal chapel that, today, is my personal favorite church in the world (aside from la Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, which is a masterpiece).\nNotre Dame de Paris\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with the former \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Notre Dame Cathedral \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is arguably one of the most famous churches in the world.\nConstruction on Notre Dame began in the 12th century, and it has gone through several iterations to get to where it is today.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an example of Gothic architecture (French Gothic, to be specific), and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth walking along the river on either side to see the grandeur of the building from the outside (and those beautiful flying buttresses!).\nNow, you might know that Notre Dame suffered a terrible fire in 2019 (you may remember all the social media posts showing their love for the church), and has been closed ever since as it was restored.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here in Paris in the weeks before it opens back up, and every local I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked to has expressed excitement.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a magnificent church, with great stained glass (though, sadly, it will be mostly replicas as a result of the fire), and I would recommend going up to the bell towers if you can for the views over Paris AND the excellent views of the gargoyles, which play an important role in the Disney masterpiece\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\n(the song \u00e2\u0080\u009cHellfire\u00e2\u0080\u009d is still a banger).\nHow to Visit:\nGreat news, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s FREE to visit Notre Dame and go inside. However, you will have to make a timed reservation, which will almost certainly be competitive. More information\nhere\n.\nSainte-Chapelle\nUntil I revisited Sainte-Chapelle on this past visit to Paris, I forgot just how impressive the main chapel really is, with its 1,000+ colorful stained glass panels depicting scenes from the bible (don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the helpful visual guide that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inside the chapel, which will help you decode what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at).\nWhat is Sainte-Chapelle, you ask?\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Royal Chapel that sat within the Palais de la Cit\u00c3\u00a9, the medieval palace that resided on the island in the middle of the Seine for a few hundred years until the kings decided to move elsewhere (somewhere safer after a few close calls with rebellions, something the French love to do!).\nThe most impressive part about the story of the Chapel, at least to me, is the fact that it went from an idea to finished in less than a decade (while Notre Dame, which is of course much bigger, took more than a century).\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a relatively quick visit \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically only one room to see here \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well worth braving the crowds, I think. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done it three times now, and I will probably do it again in a few years.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absolutely best on a sunny day around midday, when the sun reaches over the walls of the building surrounding the chapel and lights up the stained glass, but I was here on a dreary November morning when the chandeliers had to be lit because it was so dark, and I still enjoyed it.\nHow to Visit:\nThis one is not free, and I HIGHLY recommend making a timed entry reservation in advance (usually a week or two in advance is fine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it does sell out). Like many attractions in Paris, there are two lines to get into Sainte-Chapelle: the security line, and the ticket office line. By buying tickets in advance, you get to skip the second one, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just have to line up for the security check (no big bags or luggage allowed, and nowhere to leave it). You can pay a few extra Euros for an audio guide, but I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it was worth it here (and I usually love audio guides). Make your reservation\nhere\n.\nLunch and Coffee in the 1st\nAfter exploring the two churches, head over to the 1st Arrondissement, near the Louvre, for lunch and a little caffeine boost before you tackle the hefty museum that the district gets its name from.\nThe reason to head here, specifically, for lunch is the fact that the area just north of the Louvre is known for its Japanese food, which I only realized and looked into after walking along Rue Sainte Anne (\nhere\non Google Maps) on my way to the coffee shop below.\nI asked a guide about this, and he had a few recommendations in the area. First is\nKintaro\nfor ramen. Second is\nUdon Jube\n. Last is\nYou\n.\nI need to eat gluten free, so Japanese food is very difficult, generally speaking. However, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 100% gluten free Japanese lunch spot called\nCococo\nthat I absolutely adore.\nFor coffee, head straight to\nT\u00c3\u00a9lescope Cafe\nwhere you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find a compact space and excellent coffee featuring coffee from Scandinavian roasters (mostly).\nT\u00c3\u00a9lescope is one of the OG\nspecialty coffee shops in Paris\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 an oasis of light, bright coffees in a city where that was exceedingly rare a decade ago \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and its location on a relatively quiet alley a short walk from the hustle and bustle of the Louvre only accentuates the \u00e2\u0080\u009coasis\u00e2\u0080\u009d idea.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been here many times now, and it was actually the first place that made me realize you could brew great coffee using an Aeropress.\nOne other thing to note here:\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very small space, and they have strict rules about laptops (no laptops), where you should sit, and about how many drinks you need to order (at least one per person) to maximize the amount of people they can serve. Also, they prefer cash under \u00e2\u0082\u00ac5, and will add an upcharge for cards under that limit.\nThe Louvre\nBefore we get into the main part of this section, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a step back and talk about the Louvre as a tourist attraction.\nIt might be the most famous tourist attraction in Paris (maybe second after the Eiffel Tower), but our feelings on the Louvre are slightly mixed.\nOn one hand, this is one of the most impressive art collections on the planet, with an incredible breadth and depth of art \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and by extension, important moments in art history \u00e2\u0080\u0093 within its walls.\nOn the other hand, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a MASSIVE museum that would take days, if not weeks, to fully see.\nBut as you likely already know, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have days or weeks, you have a portion of one day.\nOur recommendation is to spend no more than three to four hours in the Louvre\n.\nThat gives you enough time to see the highlights (more on this in a second) and wander a bit, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have you spending a whole day inside the vast museum.\nOf course, this is all going to depend on your appetite for museums and how much of your precious time in Paris you want to spend wandering around the Louvre.\nIf you want to spend a full day doing that, by all means go for it! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably have to make a few cuts and changes to the rest of your itinerary.\nNow, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about the museum itself.\nThe building that the Louvre currently lives in was originally a military building (though it was called a palace) to protect Paris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 western flank, and later became a royal palace.\nIt was turned into a museum for the people during the French Revolution in the late 18th century, and has been open to the public ever since.\nIn the basement of the Louvre you can actually still see the restored sections of the walls of the original building, which looks very much like the walls of a castle.\nThe Louvre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection is MASSIVE, with representation from basically every corner of the globe.\nThe most famous is, of course, Da Vinci\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nMona Lisa\n, but you should absolutely set your expectations when it comes to viewing her.\nThe room where the (surprisingly small) painting lives is almost always unbearably crowded, with people essentially crowd surfing to get to the front to take their precious picture (what the heck are you even going to do with that picture? You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never going to look at it again!).\nDefinitely be sure to look at the other paintings in that room, because there are some good ones at the backs of all the people trying to get a closer look at the\nMona Lisa\n.\nHere are some other highlights that we would make sure not to miss:\nThe Winged Victory\n(which is supposedly the inspiration for the famous Nike swoosh), the French paintings (like\nLiberty Leading the People\nand the\nRaft of Medusa, Crowning of Napoleon)\nand the iconic\nVenus de Milo.\nThere are, of course, thousands of other \u00e2\u0080\u009chighlights\u00e2\u0080\u009d that we could list here, but those are the ones that stand out to us.\nA Note on Timing:\nThe afternoon is generally the best time to visit the Louvre for slightly more manageable crowds. The late afternoon / early evening will give you a marginally more peaceful experience, which is why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve organized the itinerary in this particular way.\nAnother important note:\nThe museum is closed on Tuesdays, so plan accordingly. Make sure to review their bag policies (which you can find on\ntheir FAQ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n) because big bags are not allowed in the museum.\nVisiting the Louvre on a Guided Tour\nOn our three month European adventure that took us to Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Paris, we had the chance to see multiple famous art museums.\nWe quickly realized that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just not really art museum people. But after a tour of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, I had an epiphany as to why.\nWalking around an art museum and looking at pretty paintings is cool and all, but the real pleasure is when you actually understand the story behind each work of art, and the role they played in history and the progression of art history.\nWhich, as two normal people, is something we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have in our repertoire.\nWe highly, highly recommend investing in a guided tour of the Louvre\n.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve both done it independently \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Matt multiple times \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and have come to realize that unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an art historian, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really, really hard to visit a huge art museum independently and come away with much else than \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell that was pretty\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhoa, they have so much art!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nA guided tour with an art historian is going to give you the context and stories behind each work of art, which are the things that really bring the experience to life.\nPlus, arguably more importantly, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to help you understand the important pieces and periods to focus on.\nI, Matt, have now done the Louvre three times, twice without a guide and once with a guide, and my experience with a guide brought a level of richness and understanding that I absolutely would have never gotten on my own.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only got the time or budget for a single guided tour in Paris, this should be your choice\n.\nI (Matt again) recently did\nthis tour of the Louvre at closing time\nwith Walks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a company I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done six or seven tours in Europe with, and really loved it. You can read more about my experience\nhere\n.\nI truly think this tour was worth the time and money for the multiple reasons I listed above.\nVisiting the Louvre Independently\nIf a tour isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the budget (or doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit with your timing), we have a few thoughts on how to maximize your time and pleasure at the Louvre.\nFirst, absolutely\nbook your tickets well in advance for a timed entry slot\n, which will allow you to skip the ticket office line and head straight to the security line, which everyone has to wait in (but at least you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to wait in two long lines!).\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to book your tickets a few months in advance. You can book tickets\nhere\n.\nSecond,\nif you have pre-booked tickets, you can enter through a \u00e2\u0080\u009csecret\u00e2\u0080\u009d entrance\n(but how secret can it be if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s listed on the Louvre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website?) that sees far less crowds called\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPorte des Lions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nYou can find it\nhere\non Google Maps. This does mean that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go through the iconic entrance in the glass pyramid, but could literally save you an hour of your precious time.\n2024/2025 Note: The entrance at Porte des Lions is temporarily closed in late 2024\n, with no timeline for reopening. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still skip the pyramid line and instead enter at Carrousel,\nhere\non Google Maps, which is a secondary entrance through a mall.\nThird,\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend either an afternoon visit (2pm or so), or taking advantage of the late night openings\n(currently Wednesday and Friday at the time of writing), when the museum is open late (until 9pm) and the crowds are much, much thinner. It will require a bit of rearranging, but it will be well worth it.\nLast,\nwe think the audio guide is worth it,\nand is a good alternative to a guided tour that will give you a little bit more context and history around the works of art you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at.\nMake sure to review their bag policies (which you can find on\ntheir FAQ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n) because big bags are not allowed in the museum.\nA Post-Museum Walk Through the Gardens\nAfter a few hours at the Louvre, clear your head a little bit with a nice walk through the Tuileries with a couple of quick detours en route to the famous Champs-\u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es, the ultimate example of the grand Parisian boulevards of Napoleon III\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dreams.\nThe Champs-\u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es are pretty \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeh\u00e2\u0080\u009d for us \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lined with the exact same kinds of shops and stores you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see anywhere else in the world, and it really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all that charming or interesting.\nIf you want to go to a Zara, Five Guys, or an H&M, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do it at home and save your precious time in Paris for something else.\nAnyway, from the Louvre, walk west and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll immediately be in the Tuileries, passing under one of two triumphal arches built by Napoleon that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see this afternoon (you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go to the top of the second!).\nHere are our favorite stops on your walk along the Right Bank, which as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see was the home of the nobility and aristocracy in Paris for centuries.\nTake a detour out of the gardens to the\nJardin du Palais Royal\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 another beautiful garden in the heart of the city, built around the 17\nth\ncentury Royal Palace. A great place to stop and smell the roses (literally!). This is the palace that King Louis XIV abandoned (and gave to his little brother) when he moved out of the city to Versailles.\nContinue the detour over to\nPlace de la Vend\u00c3\u00b4me\n, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find another Napoleonic relic in the center, surrounded by storefronts for many of the most famous French fashion brands in the world (Dior and Chanel have locations here, for example). The column in the center is dedicated to Napoleon, who is depicted as a Roman emperor at the top, and has depictions of many of his accomplishments winding around all the way to the top. Fun fact: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made up of melted down cannons from the Austrians that Napoleon beat at Austerlitz, one of his most famous military victories in his illustrious military career.\nHead back out towards the rivers back to the\nTuileries Gardens\n, where Parisians enjoy sitting on the lounge chairs by the fountains (there are pairs of lounge chairs that are welded together facing each other, which I thought was kind of cute) or taking walks with their friends. Cross it from the Louvre to the\nPlace de la Concorde\nto end up in the wide square with the Obelisk (it is 3,300 years old and engraved with Egyptian hieroglyphics).\nCarrying on along the Seine you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find the\nGrand Palais\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 built for the 1900 World\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fair, it is home to several exhibitions. Check out the amazing 8.5-ton art nouveau glass roof!\nFinish your walk on the\nChamps-\u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es\n, strolling towards the\nArc de Triomphe\n.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nmap of a route\nthat hits the stops above.\nClimb the Arc de Triomphe\nClose out your day in Paris with a trip to the top of the Arc de Triomphe, which was built by Napoleon in the early 19\nth\ncentury to commemorate a victory at Austerlitz. Napoleon LOVED his triumphal arches.\nA quick side note: If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in Napoleonic history, I have a recommendation for you. At the beginning of our latest three month trip to Europe that took us to Spain, Portugal, and Italy, we heard Napoleon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name over and over, and to be honest, the only things I really knew about him were that he was short (which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t true) and spoke French in a funny way (because he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a native speaker \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he was Corsican).\nSo, to learn about the man who shaped modern Europe in many ways, I started listening to\nthis podcast about Napoleon\n, and I love it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deep dive into Napoleon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life and impact on Europe during his brief stint at the top.\nNow back to your regularly scheduled programming.\nContinue all the way up to the Place de l\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u0089toile, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be looking up at the Arc from below.\nThe\nArc de Triomphe\ncan be reached through an underpass from the northern side of the Champs-\u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es, bringing you to just underneath the arch.\nGo around sunset for soft golden light washing over the sprawling city, and stay for a bit when the lights come on, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll understand how Paris got the nickname \u00e2\u0080\u009cCity of Lights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis is hands down my favorite view in Paris, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a must-visit on just about every version of an itinerary.\nParticularly if you come around sunset and stay until the city lights up, which is what I did (although it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier to do in November, when I was last in Paris, when the sun was setting around 5pm).\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll then climb 284 stairs en route to the terrace and viewing platform at the top (there are a couple of additional interior stops on the way up with information about the arc and its construction).\nFrom the terrace, you have a 360 degree view of Paris, including down the\nChamps-\u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es, towards the Eiffel Tower, and over towards Sacr\u00c3\u00a9-C\u00c5\u0093ur and Montmartre. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a special view, and is well worth the price of admission (we think).\nHow to Visit:\nAgain, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth booking your visit in advance so that you can skip the ticket line (you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still have to wait in the security line). Make your reservation\nhere\n. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to climb a winding staircase (with 284 steps) to get up to the terrace with the views (there is an elevator, but it should only be used by people who need it). Along the way, there is an interior floor with a nice display about the history and construction of the Arc. Leave bags bigger than a small backpack at home, because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not allowed.\nDay 3: Le Marais, A Foodie Adventure, and Montmartre\nOn your third day in Paris, spend your time exploring two of our favorite neighborhoods in Paris \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Le Marais and Montmartre \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sandwiched around a food experience where you can dive deeper into French food culture.\nExplore Le Marais\nLe Marais, the 3rd and 4th Arrondissements, are just east of the Louvre, and are one of the few places in Paris where you can still find the narrow alleyways that existed prior to Napoleon III\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leveling of 60% of the city to make way for the grand boulevards you see today.\nThis is our favorite part of Paris, both to visit and to stay (it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our top recommendation in our guide to\nwhere to stay in Paris\n).\nIn particular, we really enjoy the north end of the neighborhood \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a little triangle bordered by Place de la R\u00c3\u00a9publique, Arts et M\u00c3\u00a9tiers, and Square du Temple \u00e2\u0080\u0093 where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find several of our highlights listed below.\nThis part of the city is a great place to eat, drink, and shop, and is worth a couple of hours of your time to absorb the architecture and vibes as you walk around and explore.\nHere are a few of our favorite spots in Le Marais.\nThe March\u00c3\u00a9 des Enfants Rouges:\nThis is an open air market that is full of bars and restaurants and is packed full of people around lunchtime basically everyday. Is it firmly on the tourist radar? Absolutely. Does that mean you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go? Absolutely not. If you have the time, you should definitely swing by for lunch on one of your days in Paris.\nKawa\n:\nThis coffee is so good, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ordered it to be shipped to me here in the States. Multiple times. Last time I was in Paris, I found myself here a couple of different times, and it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappoint. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a coffee nerd, they have different coffee options prepared as either filter or espresso, along with a huge selection of both beans to take home, and brewing equipment.\nPlace De La R\u00c3\u00a9publique:\nA bustling square with an important metro station and a big monument in the center. A corner turns into a skatepark in the afternoon, which makes for some really good people watching.\nSquare du Temple \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Elie Wiesel:\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re big fans of this green space, which is a bit of an oasis in the middle of the most bustling part of the neighborhood.\nPlace de Vosges:\nAnother of our favorite green spaces in Paris, this one is right in the heart of all the action, and was planned in the 17th Century (and still has basically the same footprint today). Good fountain, good architecture on the perimeter, and Victor Hugo lived in a house on the square!\nInside the March\u00c3\u00a9 des Enfants Rouges\nChoose Your Own Foodie Adventure\nDiving into the food culture in places we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re visiting is one of our favorite aspects of traveling, and we try to include a food tour, cooking class, or market tour in most places we visit.\nUnfortunately, the reality is that because Matt has Celiac Disease and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have even a speck of gluten without being sick for days, a food tour or cooking class wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the cards for us in Paris.\nHOWEVER. That does NOT mean it shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be for you!\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d highly recommend it because it gives you a local\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective on the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food scene \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what and where to eat and drink \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and you get to connect with fellow travelers and try some amazing food.\nHere are some options for you, split between food tours and cooking classes. Our bias is to do a cooking class, because we LOVE to cook, but we also enjoy a good food tour.\nOption 1: Dive Into French Cuisine in a Cooking Class\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done all sorts of cooking classes around the world (read about our cooking class in Mexico City\nhere\n), and while the gluten-filled nature of most French food made it nearly impossible to find one in Paris that meets our needs, that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\nAfter all, haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you always wondered how to make the perfect croissant? Spoiler: you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably not going to want to do it more than once.\nHere are a few cooking classes that would definitely be on our list if, you know, Matt could eat gluten.\nAll three of them are baking classes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 because Paris is known for pastries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with Matthieu, a French chef who has a nice space in the heart of Saint-Germain (the 6th Arrondissement).\nLearn to Make Macarons\n:\nExactly what the title sounds like \u00e2\u0080\u0093 learn how to bake macarons from start to finish, and walk away with your very own box of 15-18 to devour later. The class is gluten free, but the equipment is used in other classes (like the croissant class), so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not suitable for Celiacs (I asked because I wanted to do it, and they advised against it).\nLearn to Make Croissants\n:\nCroissants might be the most iconic French pastry\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and also the biggest headache to make. Where better to learn to make croissants than with the help of a real chef?\nLearn to Make \u00c3\u0089clairs\n: Strap on your apron and get down to making \u00c3\u00a9clairs, including learning the ins and outs of choux pastry (a unique kind of pastry dough that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use rising agents, but employs steam to get fluffy) and get to make multiple versions of the famous \u00c3\u00a9clair. Which you of course get to devour at the end.\nOption 2: Learn About Food Culture Through a Food Tour\nHere are some food tours that caught our eye though, sadly, we also skipped these because of the whole gluten and cross-contact issue.\nMingle at the Market \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Taste Paris\n:\nThis is part market tour, part tasting. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll meet at a local market over in the 11th Arrondissement and learn about Parisian food culture through experiencing the market and tasting a selection of foods at different stalls. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a small group with a maximum of six guests, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have plenty of time and space to ask questions and really learn about Paris through the eyes of Natasha, the host, and her team.\nNO DIET CLUB:\nFirst of all, their website starts with \u00e2\u0080\u009cBye Boring Food Tours\u00e2\u0080\u009d and has a hilarious logo of a woman in a bikini riding a hot dog with a stein of beer and her middle finger up. But what about their tours? They have several tours in Paris where they take you around to their favorite spots in a specific neighborhood, which is the style we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend. The tours last between three and four hours, and you need to show up hungry otherwise you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lose steam halfway through. They have lunchtime tours in\nle Marais\nand\nCanal St. Martin\n, and an\nevening tour in Montmartre\n. If we had to choose,\nCanal St. Martin would be our pick\n.\nAn Afternoon / Evening in Montmartre\nMontmartre, until the 19th century, was actually a completely separate town (though, it was adjacent to the borders of Paris).\nIt was a small village on the hill with some shadier parts, some green open spaces, and a bunch of windmills that were used to grind flour for the population of the city.\nIn the mid-to-late 19th century, it was famous for the soirees that were thrown on weekends, when wealthy Parisians would escape the city and amble up the hill to drink and dance in the gardens that provided a much-needed escape from the urban environment a few blocks away.\nIf you go to the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay (and you should!) and learn about impressionism, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see multiple depictions of this phenomenon, most famously Renoir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nBal du moulin de la Galette.\nIt has also gained the reputation for being the home of the artists in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh, Renoir, many other artists in the impressionist movement, and even Pablo Picasso having lived in Montmartre for some period of time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nSimilar to Le Marais, Montmartre escaped the redevelopment projects that came with Napoleon III (again, not THAT Napoleon, but his nephew) that leveled huge swaths of the city to modernize it and turn it into the city you see today, with grand boulevards and wide open spaces (rather than narrow cobblestone streets).\nMostly, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because it was outside the boundaries of the city at that time.\nThe result is an uber charming neighborhood full of cobblestones, narrow winding streets, and excellent views out over Paris (which only get better the further up the hill you venture).\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charming. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s romantic (especially before or after the bulk of the tourists arrive or leave). And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to see why it has become a staple of many itineraries.\nHere are a few of our favorite spots in Montmartre.\nSacr\u00c3\u00a9-C\u00c5\u0093ur:\nAt the top of the hill is the white church on the hill \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sacr\u00c3\u00a9-C\u00c5\u0093ur \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which boasts one of my favorite views in Paris. At the top, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have an up close and personal view of both Sacr\u00c3\u00a9-C\u00c5\u0093ur itself, and the view from the platform just below it, which looks back towards the Seine and the center of Paris. You can also climb the dome of Sacr\u00c3\u00a9-C\u00c5\u0093ur for even better views \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 200+ steps, and like most church towers, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re narrow and claustrophobic.\nMontmartre Walking Tour\n:\nAs mentioned above, I did this tour on my recent trip and it was a great dive into what makes Montmartre special (beyond the Moulin Rouge). All sorts of incredible personalities lived in Montmartre, which was originally a village on the hill outside of Paris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 city limits, including many of the impressionists (including Van Gogh) and Pablo Picasso. This tour is a great deep dive into the history and culture of Montmartre, and takes a people-first approach to history that I liked.\nClove\n: Tucked away on a side street a block away from Sacr\u00c3\u00a9-C\u00c5\u0093ur, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find one of our favorite cafes in the city. I spent part of a morning here chatting with the owners (one of whom is American) and getting to know their philosophy around coffee. They work with various European roasters that change every so often, and one of the things I noticed was the beautiful ceramics. When I asked the barista about them (and complimented the beautiful drinkware), she informed me that she had made all of them herself, which I think is a lovely touch. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a coffee nerd like me, go here and have them help you explore some new coffees!\nLa Manufacture de Sans Gluten\n:\nThis tiny gluten free bakery makes, hands down, one of the top three gluten free croissants I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever eaten (they keep them in a warming case, which helps a lot). Flaky, buttery, and light \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is hard to come by when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about gluten free pastries. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pricey, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty clearly the best gluten free pastries in Paris, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6worth it!\nPain Pain\n:\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not gluten free, this bakery came highly recommended by the tour guide of the aforementioned walking tour (and a couple who I met on a different tour who was rating their favorite bakeries in Paris). I stopped by to check out the selection, and was drooling at all the options, sweet and savory, on display.\nThere are\ntwo restaurants in Montmartre that came highly recommended by two locals\nI met over the course of my most recent trip (neither are great for Celiacs, unfortunately). They are\nBouillon Pigalle\n, which is very popular (especially with tourists) but is still a good value and serves authentic French food (but be prepared to wait in line during peak times), and\nCr\u00c3\u00aaperie Broc\u00c3\u00a9liande\n, which is the place to go to try gallettes, a savory buckwheat crepe hailing from Brittany that is generally served with cider.\nThe view from just below Sacr\u00c3\u00a9-C\u00c5\u0093ur\nEspresso at Clove\nDay 4: A Day Trip to Versailles\nAs we mentioned at the beginning of this itinerary, the choice to include Versailles here might be a bit controversial.\nWe would absolutely not spend time in Versailles with anything less than four full days in town, and even that is pushing it we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say.\nHowever, it does tell an important story about the French Monarchy, and Versailles is, by far, the most incredible royal palace I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen (and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been to quite a few at this point).\nThe amount of gold on display rivals St. Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Basilica (and serves the same purpose; the projection of power), and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe that someone actually lived here.\nWhich brings us to a key question: What was this place?\nBasically, King Louis XIV was getting sick of living in Paris amongst the peasants and decided to commission his own royal palace (on the site of an existing hunting lodge) outside the city, removed from the squalor of his people.\nWhich, OOPS, sort of continued the French monarchy on a path to ruin because it showed that the king wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a man of the people AND the monarchy was broke and couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really afford a new royal palace.\nThe former royal palaces are the Louvre, which was turned into a museum, and the Palais-Royal, which was given to a previous king (and Louis XIV abandoned it, giving it to his somewhat debaucherous younger brother).\nAnyway, Versailles is worth the better part of a day of your time to wander its halls marveling at the architecture, art, and, well, gold. Definitely don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the gardens either, which are equally as impressive (we think) when things are in bloom and the fountains are fountaining.\nI should say here that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re generally not a fan of the palaces of rich people because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re usually not particularly interesting, and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to see some old king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fancy art collection. Which at least partially applies to Versailles.\nThe other thing to know about Versailles is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a short (90 ish minutes each way) train ride outside of Paris, which means that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to spend a bit of time in transit to get here.\nLast, but certainly not least, is that Versailles is going to be crowded AF, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically no way to get around it. Especially mid-morning when all the tour buses rock up.\nThe point here is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very much not worth it if you either:\na) don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about a decommissioned royal palaces that are just one big obscene display of wealth\nb) you have less than four or five days to spend on Paris (with less than that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re better off staying in Paris)\nc) you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not interested in being one of 200 people in a room with a capacity of 50 people looking at a painting of the aforementioned rich guy\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not saying we hate Versailles at all \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually an interesting place from a historical and cultural perspective because it was one domino on the road to the French Revolution \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but it is very much a busy tourist attraction, and you should set expectations accordingly.\nWhether or not to do a tour here is somewhat more complicated than museums in Paris.\nA tour means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be on a strict timeline and, unlike a museum tour that ends inside and affords you the ability to continue exploring, a tour here likely includes transportation from Paris.\nOn the other hand, the security lines at Versailles are LONG, and guided tours with a licensed guide get to use a separate entrance with shorter security lines.\nI have a couple of recommendations for tours of Versailles that I had bookmarked for my recent trip to Paris (I ended up cutting Versailles because I had done it multiple times before and it was November, which means the gardens are gray, drizzly, and dead).\nI think they offer a somewhat unique approach to visiting Versailles.\nThe first is\nthis full day bike tour\n, which spends a full day out at Versailles and includes some time exploring the less-visited nearby sights, including the town of Versailles itself.\nBeing on a bike makes it a little more feasible to cover this much ground (you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only on a bike outside the palace and gardens, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wondering).\nFor what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth, that would be my top choice if I were going to do a tour of Versailles tomorrow because I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a unique approach to visiting one of the most popular tourist attractions in France.\nThe second is\nthis more traditional tour of Versailles\nwith a Parisian tour company (which I appreciate).\nIt includes transportation to and from Paris, but it does end at the palace (which gives you more time to explore if you want) and spends a fair amount of time (three hours or so) on the palace and gardens.\nSome tours try to do it all \u00e2\u0080\u0093 palace and gardens \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in an hour and a half, which I think is madness.\nThe palace at Versailles is closed on Mondays\n, so plan accordingly.\nGetting to Versailles\nTo get to Versailles from Paris,\nthe easiest route is to hop on the RER-C\n.\nThe line runs along the Seine (which means it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easily accessible). Take it to the stop called \u00e2\u0080\u009cChateau Rive Gauche\u00e2\u0080\u009d (\nhere\non Google Maps). From there, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a short walk to the entrance.\nThis route takes roughly 90 minutes, maybe a bit shorter depending on the day and where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re riding from.\nHowever, the RER-C has some notable downsides, like the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subject to closures and delays.\nAnother option is catching the N Train from Gare Montparnasse, which is MUCH faster but takes you to a different station (Versailles-Chantiers) that means a longer walk to the palace.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an L Train from Gare Saint-Lazare to Versailles Rive Droite (you need to make sure you get on the line that goes there) that gets you to the chateau in a similar manner, but is probably less convenient unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re staying in the 9th or Montmartre.\nTips for Visiting Independently\nDefinitely book tickets in advance\nhere\nand try to get either an early morning entry or, alternatively, a later afternoon entry (think 2-3pm or so), when the palace is relatively quiet.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still have to wait in the (sometimes long) security lines.\nIf you want to see the gardens and it is high season, book the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPassport\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwhich includes the palace, gardens, and Estate of Trianon.\nIn the low season, from November through March, the cheaper Palace ticket actually includes the gardens (but NOT the Estate of Trianon, if you want to see that).\nThis is another place where\nI highly recommend the audio guide\n, at least partially because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crowded and you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always be able to get up close to read the signage.\nMore Paris Travel Guides\nPlanning a trip to Paris? Matt, who speaks French \u00e2\u0080\u009creally well for an American\u00e2\u0080\u009d (as multiple French people have told him \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his proudest achievement in life), loves Paris.\nAs you get into planning your trip, you might find some of these other detailed guides we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve written about Paris helpful.\nExactly What to Do in Paris (for First Timers)\nWhere to Stay in Paris: A Complete Guide for First Timers\nA Coffee Nerd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Guide to the Best Coffee in Paris\nClosing Time at the Louvre: Our Favorite Guided Tour of the Louvre\nGluten Free in Paris: A Complete Guide (For Foodies)\nWhat to Do with More Time in Paris\nIf you have more time in Paris, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still plenty to do and see. I recently spent 10 full days exploring Paris and never once ran out of things to do (here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our complete guide to our favorite\nthings to do in Paris\n), see, eat, or drink.\nHowever, our best advice here is to take the things above at a more leisurely pace, spending more time savoring the sights, sounds, and tastes of Paris.\nGo Deeper with a Walking Tour\nOver the past few years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to the realization that walking tours are often our favorite way to get oriented in a new city for a few reasons.\nFirst, you get a\ncrash course in history and culture\n, which is a valuable baseline that will make the rest of your trip more enjoyable.\nSecond,\nyou get to spend a few hours with a local\nwho will give you all sorts of tips about what to eat, drink (and see), and specifically where to find the best version of said things.\nLast, but not least you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ndiscover places that you definitely would never have found on your own\n.\nWe almost always start our trip with a walking tour for these reasons (and the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful to get outside and move to combat jet lag).\nLike we mentioned above, Paris is slightly too big to really cover a bunch of ground on foot, but what you can do is explore a far more targeted slice of Paris with a local to get a deeper understanding of the culture and history of a time period or neighborhood.\nI have done several of this type of tour over my trips to Paris.\nHere are three tours that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d look at, two of which I have personally done and enjoyed.\nThe French Revolution Tour\n:\nOn a trip to Paris a few years ago, I discovered Thierry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tours near the end of our visit, and wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to make the timing work with our schedule. I bookmarked them and saved them for a future trip and, on this most recent trip, ended up doing two of his tours. Thierry is a (very passionate) historian who will dive into French history\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important moments \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in this case, the French revolution \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and spend a couple of hours teaching you the basics of what happened, who was involved, and how it affects France today. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an engaging storyteller, and this tour in particular was a favorite because I, an American, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t learn that much about the French Revolution in school, so this filled in a lot of gaps. I also did\nhis Napoleon tour\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m particularly interested in Napoleon and his impact on Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s modernization and liberalization \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and found it to be a great way to set the record straight for people who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t learn anything other than \u00e2\u0080\u009cshort dictator\u00e2\u0080\u009d in school.\nMedieval Paris Walking Tour\n:\nThis tour is with Walks, one of my favorite tour companies in Europe with whom I have done multiple tours, including one in Paris (though, for transparency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, not this one). I had this tour on my radar for my last trip, and it ended up getting cut to do other things (mostly drink coffee, walk, and eat more gluten free pastries). It focuses on the medieval core of Paris, which is \u00c3\u008ele de la Cit\u00c3\u00a9 and the area around it, and includes entry to both Notre Dame and Sainte-Chappelle, two must-see churches in Paris (I think). It will give you a nice baseline for understanding the city, its layout, and its history.\nMontmartre Walking Tour\n:\nI did this great tour on my recent trip, where I actually stayed in Montmartre for half of my time in Paris, and it was an informative dive into what makes Montmartre special (beyond the Moulin Rouge). All sorts of incredible personalities lived in Montmartre, which was originally a village on the hill outside of Paris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 city limits, including many of the impressionists (including Van Gogh) and Pablo Picasso. This tour offers a fascinating deep dive into the history and culture of Montmartre, and takes a people-first approach to history that I liked.\nThe Rodin Museum\nThis might actually be our favorite museum in Paris!\nThe reason we like it is that, rather than being a huge collection of art cobbled together by some rich family centuries ago, it follows the life of the famous sculptor Auguste Rodin, and shows his progression throughout his life from his first official works to world-famous pieces like\nthe Thinker\nand\nthe Gates of Hell.\nThe garden (really, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sculpture garden) is gorgeous too, and well worth walking around. Get the audio guide \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excellent!\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the 7th Arrondissement. More information like hours and costs\nhere\n.\nTake a Seine River Cruise\nTo be completely honest, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never actually done this ourselves. The reason it shows up here is twofold.\nOne, I did a canal cruise in Amsterdam on a recent trip that turned out to be one of my favorite\nthings to do in Amsterdam\n, and offered a completely different perspective of the city than I had previously gotten.\nSecond, I have heard from both readers and fellow travelers that this is consistently one of their favorite things to do.\nThere are hundreds of versions of this cruise, and my advice would be to choose one with a smaller company and, ideally, a smaller boat where you get live commentary or a live guide where you can ask questions and actually learn about the city.\nWhat To Do with Less Time in Paris\nWith less time in Paris, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend cutting the number of things you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to fit in. The alternative \u00e2\u0080\u0093 trying to fit the same number of attractions into a shorter time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will leave you needing a vacation from your vacation. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m speaking from experience here.\nThe first thing to cut is the day trip to Versailles\n. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cool, sure, but at the end of the day it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a rich person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s palace with some beautiful gardens.\nWe love the Jardins du Luxembourg in the 6\nth\nArrondissement (included in the itinerary above), which are a little less manicured, but are a good substitute.\n3 Days in Paris\nWith three days, cut the day trip to Versailles and follow the itinerary as written above for days 1-3. This is an easy one.\n2 Days in Paris / A Weekend in Paris\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only got a couple of days in Paris, the first thing we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do is\nchoose between the Louvre and Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay\n.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much to see in Paris that, with only a couple of days, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it makes sense to spend 3-4 hours on each museum, which is the amount of time you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need to do them both justice.\nThe second thing we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend is to\npick two of the neighborhoods on day 3\n, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend that you choose Montmartre and Le Marais (sorry, Canal St. Martin!).\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what two days in Paris could look like.\nDay 1:\nMontmartre, Le Marais, and the Eiffel Tower\nDay 2:\nThe Gothic Cathedrals, a Foodie Adventure, the Louvre, and the Arc de Triomphe\nYou can still use the relevant sections of the detailed 4 day itinerary above to plan out the specifics of your weekend in Paris.\nOne Day in Paris\nOur first tip for spending a day in Paris is to book a second (or third).\nJoking aside, trying to see it all in a day just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to happen, which means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to prioritize and make some hard choices on what to save for next time.\nOne big assumption we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to make here is that\nyou want to see the Louvre\n. If that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to eat up a significant chunk of time that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to plan around. You could easily swap the Louvre for the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already done the Louvre before, or want something a little different.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also highly recommend investing in a\n24 hour Metro Pass\nto make getting around Paris more efficient.\nHere are the things we think you should focus on with one day in Paris:\nThe Louvre OR the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Orsay\nThe Gothic Cathedrals and Le Marais\nThe Eiffel Tower\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d start with the Louvre when they open (go to\nTelescope Coffee\n, some of the\nbest coffee in Paris, nearby for coffee and pastries beforehand!) and spend the morning exploring their extensive collection, preferably on\nthis guided tour\n, which we recently did and loved.\nThen, make your way east through Le Marais, stopping at the\nMarche des Enfants Rouge for lunch\nand exploring the 3\nrd\nand 4\nth\nArrondissements en route to the two Gothic Cathedrals,\nNotre Dame\n(the interior and bell tower are closed indefinitely, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth admiring the twin towering bell towers from outside) and\nSainte-Chappelle\n.\nTo end your day, take the metro over to\nthe 7\nth\nArrondissement\nto end your day in the shadow of the\nEiffel Tower\n.\nRelax there for a bit, then walk under the tower (go up to the top if you want \u00e2\u0080\u0093 make sure to book tickets in advance) and take in the view from\nTrocad\u00c3\u00a9ro\n, which is across the river to the west and has our favorite views of the tower.\nMatt Hansen\nMatt is the founder and main writer behind Wheatless Wanderlust, which he started back in 2018 as a way to share his gluten free travel guides with his fellow Celiac travelers.\nSince then, Matt and his wife Alysha have visited all of the national parks in the western USA, spent three months in Europe, and have explored every corner of the Pacific Northwest, which is where Matt grew up.\nHe has now settled down in Portland, Oregon, and makes several international trips a year to continue exploring (read: eating all of the gluten free foods).\nHe writes super detailed guides to the places they visit, bringing together personal experience and historical context to help YOU plan an amazing trip.\n6 Comments\nWhat an amazing amount of information.

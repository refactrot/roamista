In my case with a 16 hour time difference and an 11-hour flight, that was definitely the case. You will probably be flying into the Narita Airport just outside of Tokyo, which is Japan\u2019s largest international airport. Feeling hungry after your flight, or need to wait for a friend to arrive? Narita Airport is 5 floors, the 4th and 5th boasting a large array of shops and restaurants to keep you entertained.\nUpon arriving I recommend doing 2 very important things at the airport: pick up your pocket wifi and exchange your JR Pass voucher for the actual Rail Pass (read the\nJapan Travel Guide\nto understand why these things are so important).\nPick up your Pocket Wifi\nWhen you reserve your pocket wifi online you\u2019ll be able to specify which airport you\u2019re flying into and which terminal, and they\u2019ll give you all of the details on where to pick up your rental. I reserved mine through\nGlobal Advanced Communications\n. My pocket wifi was waiting for me at the airport Post Office. Since I came in internationally, I was in Terminal 1 of Narita Airport. After making it through security, the Post Office was on the 4th floor of Terminal 1 and was easy to find.\nExchange your voucher for the Japan Rail Pass\nActivating the JR Pass at Narita Airport\nis quick and easy. The lowest level of the Narita Airport, the B1 floor, connects with the rail system. Just outside of the station on the B1 floor of both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2-3, look for the JR East Travel Service Center. Here you will be able to exchange your JR Pass voucher for your actual Japan Rail Pass. All you need is your voucher and your passport. The attendants of the service center speak English and are very helpful if you have any questions. The hours of the\nJR East Travel Service Centers\nare 8:15 \u2013 19:00 (Terminal 1) and 8:15 \u2013 20:00 (Terminal 2-3), open every day of the year.\nIf for some reason your flight arrives after the JR East Travel Service Center is already closed (this was the case for my friend), you can exchange your voucher the next day at the JR Service Center within Tokyo Station before taking the bullet train to Kyoto. You\u2019ll just have to pay for this first ride from Narita to Tokyo Station with cash using the ticketing machine at the station outside the platform.\nJR East has a pricing table\nyou can check \u2013 the ride from Narita to Tokyo on the Narita Express costs 3,020 yen (roughly $30 USD).\nTake the Narita Express to Tokyo Station\nOnce you\u2019re ready to leave the airport, head to the bottom level of the airport, the B1 floor, if you\u2019re not there already from exchanging your JR Pass. Take the JR Narita Express (NEX) to Tokyo Station. This is a JR line so you can use your JR Pass at no additional cost. The ride is about 50 minutes long.\nHotel near Tokyo Station\nBy the time we got to Tokyo Station it was around midnight, so we walked to our hotel that we had booked for the night near Tokyo Station and went right to bed to rest up for the early start the next day.\nFor this night\u2019s hotel, our only criteria was that it be relatively cheap, within walking distance of Tokyo Station, and preferably have two beds. Well we found the perfect match!\nWe ended up staying at\nCenter Hotel Tokyo\n. It was about an 11-14 minute walk with our luggage from the station. It wasn\u2019t anything fancy, but it was a nice place to sleep after a long day of travel and even included breakfast!\nBook your stay:\nCenter Hotel Tokyo\non Hotels.com\nPhoto credit: Unsplash\nDay 2-4: Kyoto\nRide the Shinkansen bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto\nFrom Tokyo Station, you will take the Tokaido Shinkansen (bullet train) to Kyoto. There are 3 trains that are a part of the Tokaido Shinkansen line: Hikari, Kodama, and the Nozomi. The Nozomi is not a part of JR Group and is not covered with the Japan Rail Pass. Both the Kodama and Hikari lines\nare\ncovered by the Japan Rail Pass. The Kodama line makes more stops at smaller cities and takes about 4 hours to reach Kyoto, while the Hikari line is about a 2.5 hour ride at 320 km/h (199 mph), stopping only at the major cities along the way. So you will want to take the Hikari line to save time.\nYou can get tickets at the station outside the Shinkansen gates at ticketing machines or reserve seats with the help of an attendant at the\nTokyo Station JR East Travel Service Center\n(which is what we did our first time). If you don\u2019t have a Japan Rail Pass for some reason, a one-way ticket on the bullet train will cost you 13,080 yen for an unreserved seat, which is about $118 USD at the time of this post.\nYou can see how a JR Pass will quickly pay for itself!\nWhere to stay in Kyoto\nWhere We Stayed\nThe Royal Park Hotel\nwas our home during our few days in Kyoto. It was rather spacious and modern and is only a short walk from the nearest train station. To get here from Kyoto Station, take the Karasuma line, then transfer to the Tozai line to arrive at Sanjo Station. From Sanjo station, the hotel is just a 3-minute walk across a bridge on the Kamo River.\nI was very happy with our hotel \u2013 in fact, it was my favorite from our entire stay in Japan for its high quality for a moderate price.\nBook your stay:\nThe Royal Park Hotel Sanjo\non Hotels.com\nFrom the research that I did before my trip, this area came up as \u201cthe area to stay\u201d while in Kyoto and it didn\u2019t disappoint, with plenty of cool shops and restaurants along with the nearby\nShinkyogoku Shopping District\n.\nOther High-End or Cheaper Hotel Options\nIf you\u2019re looking for something a little more luxurious for your stay in Kyoto, check out\nHyatt Regency Kyoto\n, the\nFour Seasons Hotel Kyoto\n, or\nThe Ritz-Carlton Kyoto\n. And if you\u2019d like to see some cheaper options, look at the popular\nHotel Sunroute Kyoto\n, the\nTour Club\n, or\nK\u2019s House Kyoto Hostel\n.\nExplore more Kyoto hotel options\non\nHotels.com\nThings to do in Kyoto\nWelcome to Kyoto, Japan\u2019s famed historical city. Here are a few things we did in Kyoto that I would highly recommend experiencing during your trip:\nFushimi Inari Taisha\nFushimi Inari-taisha: the iconic, endless orange-red gates that wind up the trail to the peak of Mt. Inari, with countless moss-covered stone shrines along the path. Keep in mind, this is an actual hike. The hike takes 2 to 3 hours roundtrip and is about 5km long, up the 233 meter height of Mt. Inari. You don\u2019t have to do the entire hike, but the beginning is the most crowded and if you continue on you can have parts of this magical trail all to yourself. This was my favorite thing from the one week I spent in Japan. Definitely try to make it here if you have the chance.\nRead more:\nVisiting Fushimi Inari-taisha: The Most Magical Place in Kyoto\nKinkaku-ji Temple, The Golden Pavilion\nKinkaku-ji Temple was like something from a dream. The Golden Pavilion is covered in gold leaf, which is where it gets its name. It really was a magical sight to behold that I recommend visiting. Just mentally prepare yourself for the crowds of people, which are to be expected at an awe-inspiring destination with such a rich history. And the entry fee is only 400 yen (about $4.00 USD).\nRead more:\nVisiting Kinkakuji Temple (The Golden Pavilion) in Kyoto, Japan\nPhoto credit: Unsplash\nArashiyama Bamboo Forest\nArashiyama forest is a fortress of towering bamboo shoots, softly rustling in the wind and creating a peaceful melody. Take a stroll through the bamboo forest and lose yourself in its serenity.\nWhile in Arashiyama, you can explore the local restaurants and do some souvenir shopping. There is also a nearby Monkey Park in Arashiyama you can check out if you have the time. And when you\u2019re ready to leave, make sure to visit the underrated, colorfully-decorated poles of the Kimono Forest. My recommendation: Wait until it gets dark to experience the magic of the kimono-patterned \u201cforest\u201d fully illuminated.\nRead more:\nExploring Arashiyama Bamboo Forest in Kyoto, Japan\nDay 5: Nara\nHow to get there\nWe checked out of our Kyoto hotel and went to Kyoto Station. At Kyoto Station, we used one of the lockers to store our luggage for the day. There are tons of\nlockers available for use all around the station\n, just follow the \u201ccoin lockers\u201d signs. They come in a variety of sizes and cost between 300, 500 and 700 yen. Take note of which locker number you stored your bags in and where the locker is located within Kyoto Station so that you can easily pick up your luggage at the end of the day!\nFrom Kyoto Station, take the JR Nara Line all the way to Nara Station. This is a 1-hour train ride that is free with your Japan Rail Pass or 710 yen without a JR pass.\nKofukuji Temple: Five-Story Wooden Pagoda\nOn your walk from Nara Station to Nara deer park, make a stop at the\nKofukuji Temple\nalong the way. Kofukuji is home to a collection of buildings across its grounds including a five-story pagoda and three-story pagoda. The five-story pagoda is the second tallest wooden pagoda in all of Japan!\nIf you have more time in Nara, you can also check out Nara\u2019s other temples and shrines. Besides Kofukuji, Nara is notably home to Todaiji which is one of Japan\u2019s most famous temples. Kofukuji and\nTodaiji\nare both a part of Nara\u2019s Seven Great Temples.\nNara Deer Park\nVisiting the deer park is a fun and unique experience, and something you\u2019ve probably heard about if you\u2019ve researched things to do when visiting Japan. Nara deer park is home to over a thousand free-roaming, wild shika deer. Although they are wild, they are quite friendly and you can even buy biscuits to feed them! The size of the park is over 1,000 acres, so you can easily spend hours here walking the paths and interacting with the deer. Entrance to Nara deer park is free and a pack of biscuits to feed the deer is only 150 yen (which is about $1.50 USD).\nRead more:\nA Day in Nara: Visiting Japan\u2019s Amazing Deer Park!\nTry Okonomiyaki\nWhat is okonomiyaki\n, you may be asking? Only a super delicious, savory Japanese pancake. The Japanese word \u201cokonomiyaki\u201d translates to \u201cgrilled as you like it\u201d. Its origins are of the Kansai region of Japan, and specifically Osaka. Since this one-week itinerary didn\u2019t include Osaka, Nara was the closest next-best thing. There are several restaurants in town that specialize in okonomiyaki and you can watch the chef grill them right in front of you.\nObviously, you should also have ramen, udon, sushi, and all the other delicious Japanese foods that you can think of during your trip to Japan (seriously I ate so much on this trip). But I just mention okonomiyaki since it\u2019s something \u201cdifferent\u201d that many people outside of Japan might not know about and it is so good!\nBack to Kyoto then onward to Tokyo\nOnce our day trip to Nara was over, we took the JR Nara Line back to Kyoto Station where we picked up our bags from the lockers we had stored them in at the beginning of the day. Then onto the Shinkansen bullet train for a second time to make the same trip from Day 2 but in reverse back to Tokyo. Once again, the ride is about 2.5 hours long and is no extra cost with a Japan Rail Pass.\nWe arrived in Tokyo very late that night and went directly to our hotel to check in and get to bed. It would be another early start in the morning for a day trip to Mt. Fuji.\nPhoto credit: Unsplash\nDay 6: Mt. Fuji\nHow to get there\nEarly in the morning, take a train from Tokyo to Kawaguchiko station for a full day trip exploring the area around Mt. Fuji. From Shinjuku Station, take the Kaiji Limited Express to Otsuki. Transfer from there to the Fujikyuko line (a privately held railway that costs about \u00a51,440) to go to Kawaguchiko station. This all takes about 2 hours travel time. At Kawaguchiko station, there are buses you can take to get all around the area.\nBelow are some options of things to do while you\u2019re there. We spent one day in the Mt. Fuji area and were only able to do a couple of these things, but if you have the time to spend an extra day or two in the area and explore more I would recommend it! You could hike the mountain or explore more of the\nfive lakes surrounding Mt. Fuji\n. It was so peaceful here away from the hustle and bustle of the big cities.\nPhoto credit: Unsplash\nLake Kawaguchiko\nLake Kawaguchiko\nis the most accessible of the five lakes surrounding Mt. Fuji and is a favorite spot to view the mountain for good reason. Viewing Mt. Fuji from across the lake on its northern side makes for a beautiful scene, even if it\u2019s on a cloudy day like the day we went. If the water of Lake Kawaguchiko is calm, the image of Mt. Fuji may be reflected in the lake. And if your trip is around mid-April, you might even be lucky enough to enjoy the view with cherry blossoms (check the\ncherry blossom forecast\nbefore your trip).\nGetting to and around Lake Kawaguchiko is easy from Kawaguchiko Station by taking the\nOmni Bus\nlines. You will need Yen coins for payment to drop in the machine on the bus, or you can buy the unlimited 2-day pass for 1,500 yen.\n5th Station Mt. Fuji\nYou can take the Subaru Line toll road to\nFuji Subaru Line 5th Station\n, located at the lower slopes of Mt. Fuji. If your trip to Japan is during the correct time of year (between July and September) and have an extra day to spend in the area you could even make the\nhike up Mt. Fuji\nfrom here! It\u2019s about a 9 hour hike round trip, and definitely on my bucket list. But the Fuji Subaru 5th Station is also a popular sightseeing spot, offering an impressive view of the five lakes area below.\nPhoto credit: Unsplash\nAokigahara Forest\nAlso known as \u201cSuicide Forest\u201d or the \u201cSea of Trees\u201d, Aokigahara forest is thick with towering trees and known for its both eerie and magical nature. You can access the forest by bus from Kawaguchiko Station. There are multiple bus stops throughout the forest for different walking trails. Just stay on the trail and be respectful of the area. From the Omni Bus Green Line, there are several stops at caves that lie deep within the forest including\nNarusawa Ice Cave\n,\nSaiko Bat Cave\n, and the\nFugaku Wind Cave\n.\nPhoto credit: Unsplash\nDay 7-8: Tokyo\nWhere to stay in Tokyo\nAfter doing some research, we decided to stay in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo. This area had a lot to offer in terms of restaurants and things to do, and our hotel was within walking distance of Shinjuku Station, a major station in Tokyo\u2019s rail system.\nShinjuku Station helped us stay closely connected to the entire city of Tokyo as well as keeping other nearby areas of Japan easily accessible to us for day trips. I was very satisfied with our choice thanks to its central location and yet it was just far enough from the main busy streets of Shinjuku that it was never too loud at night.\nHotels in Shinjuku\nWhere We Stayed\nWe chose to stay at the\nHotel Rose Garden Shinjuku\nfor its quality for the best price. Our room was a decent size and had two separate twin beds \u2013 pretty much our only stipulation for hotels and yet harder to find in Japan than one might imagine!\nBook your stay:\nHotel Rose Garden Shinjuku\non Hotels.com\nOther High-End or Cheaper Hotel Options\nHowever, there are much nicer hotels in the area if you have the budget. If you\u2019re looking for a more luxurious or comfortable option in the Shinjuku area, check out the\nKeio Plaza Hotel\n, the\nHilton Tokyo\n, or the\nPark Hyatt Tokyo\n. And conversely, if you\u2019re on a tighter budget, you can check out the\nImano Tokyo Hostel\nor even stay at a\ncapsule hotel\n.\nExplore more hotels in Shinjuku\non\nHotels.com\nThings to do in Tokyo\nAfter enjoying the historic Kyoto, it is time to experience Japan\u2019s ultra-modern culture of Tokyo. Tokyo is the largest city in the world, and there\u2019s no way to see all that it has to offer in a couple of days. These are just a few of the things we did during our short time in Tokyo that I recommend:\nTokyo Tower\nTokyo Tower\nis the world\u2019s tallest, self-supported steel tower, taller than the Eiffel Tower that it was modeled after. This tower is an iconic part of the Tokyo skyline and a popular tourist destination for that reason. For \u00a5900 you can go to the observation deck at the top for some lovely views of the city. Along with the walls of windows, the observation deck is home to a souvenir shop and a cafe.\nTokyo Skytree\nAlong with Tokyo Tower, you can also check out Tokyo\u2019s taller observatory,\nTokyo Skytree\n. When we went it was rainy and cloudy from the observatory deck so we opted out. They have screens broadcasting the view from the top at the entrance which is helpful when making your decision.\nAdmission\nto the Skytree\u2019s highest observation deck on floor 450 is \u00a51,030, but they also offer tickets to their floor 350 observation deck and \u201cFast Skytree Tickets\u201d for an added cost.\nSens\u014d-ji Temple\nSensoji Temple\n, also known as Asakusa Kannon Temple, is Tokyo\u2019s oldest and most significant temple, originally built in 645. Among the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, this beautiful temple offers a peaceful escape. At night the temple is lit up which adds to its striking beauty. If you do come during the day, the street ahead of the temple is lined with shops and booths selling crafts, souvenirs, and sweet and savory snacks.\nVisit Harajuku\nThe Harajuku district is known for its over-the-top style and shopping. We spent hours walking down the narrow streets shopping for souvenirs and people watching. While in Harajuku we also stopped at the eccentric\nKawaii Monster Cafe\n, with crazy, colorful decor and just as colorful menu items. The food is a little overpriced, but you\u2019re really paying for the experience.\nShibuya Crossing\nOn an average night, you can find this chaotic crossing filled with hundreds of people walking in different directions. A street crossing may seem trivial, but the sheer size, complexity, and the overwhelming number of people made it fascinating. Shibuya Crossing is the busiest pedestrian crossing\nin the world\n! We stopped to watch people cross at least five separate times, then joined in ourselves a couple of times.\nHachik\u014d Statue\nWhile you\u2019re at Shibuya Crossing, make sure to stop by the\nHachik\u014d Statue\njust outside of Shibuya Station. This statue is modeled after the famous Akita dog named Hachik\u014d, the \u201cmost loyal dog in Japan\u201d, who waited for his owner to return from his commute each day outside of Shibuya Station in the 1920s. After his owner died, Hachik\u014d continued to come to wait for his return at the station daily for 9 years. The story of the dog Hachik\u014d\u2019s loyalty has become a symbol of pride for Japan and this statue was created in his honor.\nTsukiji Fish Market\nThe Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo is one of the oldest and largest fish markets in the world, famous for its sprawling wholesale fish and food selection. The area is tightly packed with booths and shops of owners selling their wares, everything from ceramics to knives, as well as innumerable food stalls and restaurants. You will have no trouble finding fresh fish to eat here. This bustling market is the perfect place to hunt for souvenirs and try some ultra-fresh sushi!\nUdon Shin\nUdon Shin\nin Shinjuku was literally my favorite meal from my entire trip to Japan. The flavorful broth, the soft noodles, the tender meat\u2026 I definitely recommend giving Udon Shin a try while you\u2019re in Tokyo in the Shinjuku area. Expect a bit of a wait when you come here as this is a popular spot for good reason. We arrived around 6:30pm and had about a 45minute wait in the chilly autumn rain. In the meantime, you can scour the\nUdon Shin Yelp\nreviews and get hyped.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Linny + Peter (@adventureswithpinny)\nDay 9: Goodbye, Japan!\nTokyo to Narita Airport\nAnother travel day, but this one much sadder than the first day because it is leaving Japan. I went to the nearby Shinjuku Station and took an express train back to Narita airport directly from there. Since I bought the 7-day Japan Rail Pass and it expired that day, I went to the ticket booth to buy my ticket. It was about $30 USD and you can pay with a credit card (a good thing for me since I was out of yen at this point).\nIf your rail pass isn\u2019t going to be expired, I would recommend taking the rail to Tokyo Station and then riding the JR Narita Express (NEX) from there, as it will be no extra cost with a JR Pass. After about a one hour ride watching the final glimpses of Japan flash by your window, you will be back at the Narita Airport where you started your journey through Japan. Go to your terminal, check in for your flight, make it through airport security\u2026 you know the drill.\nUntil Next Time\nOne week is not enough time to fully explore any country and I can\u2019t wait to return to Japan someday to delve deeper into its culture. I want to see the cherry blossom season and climb Mt. Fuji! To learn more about my one week in Japan and the things that I did there, make sure to check out the individual blog posts listed below.

Read my\ndisclosure\nfor more information.\nUpdated October 2023\nWelcome to Tokyo and its maze of bright lights, restaurants, and everything else imaginative that fills in the cracks. This first-timer\u2019s guide to Tokyo is just the start to the endless adventures in this city.\nI will never forget the moment I walked out in Shinjuku Station. It was my first glimpse of the city \u2014 seas of people passing by, vendors selling an assortment of oddly-colored food \u2014 all sights and smells that I would soon grow accustomed to.\nThe sheer vibrancy of the city is hard to soak in and even after five days in Tokyo, I could have gone back for more. Spots like small coffee shops tucked in lush corners of the city to shops specializing in hilariously cartooned characters, make Tokyo, well Tokyo. It\u2019s the weird and the wonderful.\nAnthony Bourdain said it well: \u201cTokyo may well be the most amazing food city in the world, with a nearly unimaginable variety of places stacked one on top of the other, tucked away on every level on densely-packed streets.\u201d It\u2019s hard to say where to begin.\nThe city is large, but a smart and efficient network of underground rail connects it all together. Daunting, but an unfamiliar orderliness makes Tokyo work the way it does. It\u2019s clean, it\u2019s organized, and somehow it blends beautifully. There\u2019s no sense of urgency, as they know that each person has a task done to be done, and through the quietness and peaceful lining up at a train stop, you can spot a glimpse of this.\nTokyo is mesmerizing. It waits for those willing to step into a world that most will never understand, but can, at the very least, scratch the surface.\nShort on Time? Here Are My Top Picks for the Best Hotels in Tokyo:\nJR-East Hotel Mets Shibuya\n,\nfor the best location\nShibuya Granbell Hotel\n,\nfor the best location\nHotel Emit\n,\nfor the best boutique hotel\nMustard Hotel\n,\nfor the best modern hotel\nLooking for some itinerary inspiration?

The\nJR Rail Pass\ncovers a few of the lines, which is recommended as it\u2019s around $30 a person. Expect at least an hour to hour and half to Shinjuku/Shibuya area.\nWhat\u2019s the Best Way to Get Around Tokyo?\nThe entire city is easily traversed by foot, train, or bus.\nThe\nSuica card\nis helpful for using the bus and local train. You can get one at the main stations and, with a small deposit, have access to reload this card. If you have a JR Rail Pass, this is also applicable for certain lines in Tokyo. Be sure to apply and purchase your\nJR Rail Pass\nprior to arrival in Japan.\nTravel Tip:\nBe sure to apply and purchase your\nJR Rail Pass\nbefore arrival in Japan.\nAre Credit Cards Accepted in Tokyo?\nJapan, even though it is incredibly modern, is still a primarily cash-only country. Carry Yen on you at all times to cover meals, shopping, and transportation. The best place to withdraw cash is at a Seven Eleven ATM\u2019s.\nWhen is the Best Time to Visit the Top Attractions in Tokyo?\nFor all sights, if you\u2019re looking for those \u201cno crowd\u201d photos, be sure to arrive no later than 7:30/8 am. The top attractions will get incredibly busy and it is worth it to get up a bit earlier.\nAre Restaurant Reservations Required in Tokyo?\nMost restaurants need reservations far in advance. The best way to handle any restaurant reservation is to have your hotel concierge call and reserve. There were quite a few where we couldn\u2019t get one almost two-three weeks in advance.\nWhere to Stay in Tokyo\nFor our trip, we rented an Airbnb with friends in a quiet area left of\u00a0Yoyogi Park. If you\u2019re looking to rent an Airbnb (use\nthis link\nfor $40 off your first booking), the corridor between\u00a0Higashi-Kitazawa Station and Yoyogi Park is really nice and quiet. It\u2019s ideal to be within walking distance of a train station. Though Shinjuku and Shibuya are the best stations to be nearby, I would not recommend staying in those neighborhoods if you are looking for something quieter.\nTokyo is a vast city and where to stay has a big influence on your experience. For an in-depth guide to Tokyo\u2019s neighborhoods and my recommendations for the best hotels in each, read my\n5-day Tokyo itinerary\n.\nIf you\u2019re short on time, here are my top picks from that post:\nJR-East Hotel Mets Shibuya\n,\nfor the best location\nShibuya Granbell Hotel\n,\nfor the best location\nHotel Emit\n,\nfor the best boutique hotel\nMustard Hotel\n,\nfor the best modern hotel\nFor the full list of recommendations,\nread the full post here\n.\nWhere to Eat in Tokyo\nFUKU Yakitori\nKaikaya by the Sea\nSakura Tei\nKotaro\nArguably the best izakaya in the city, it has a beautiful space and incredible food.

The Priority Pass app is the first thing I check when I have a layover. I\u2019ve been a member for over a decade, and having a comfortable place to relax before and between flights makes air travel so much more enjoyable.\n6. Don\u2019t Forget Travel Insurance\nI never leave the country without travel insurance. It provides comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong (ie. illness, injury, theft, and cancelations, etc.). I use it frequently for my travels to stay protected.\nMy favorite companies that offer the best coverage and rates are:\nWorld Nomads\n(best for all-around)\nSafety Wing\n(best for frequent travelers)\nXx,\nJessica\nGuides\nTokyo\nRelated Posts\nBest Things to Do in Amsterdam: Guide for First Timers\nFebruary 12, 2025\nHow to Get Around Japan: A Japan Rail Travel Guide\nFebruary 12, 2025\nThe Ultimate Guide to Santorini, Greece: Best Things to Do\nMay 5, 2024\n1\nComment\nRohan Gillett\n2 months ago\nReply\nYou can also download the Suica card app from the Google and Apple stores when you are in Japan.

It was only supposed to take us 2 hours and 45 minutes. Click\nhere\nto find out why it took us a little longer than expected.\nUpon arrival, we checked into our hotel: Hotel Century (Southern Tower).\nAfter checking in, we left immediately for Shibuya crossing. Right outside of Shibuya Station stands a dedicated statue of\nHachiko\n. Long story short, it was a friendly and loyal dog to his master and beloved by everyone. He walked with his master to his train stop everyday and waited for him to get back. Hachiko knew what time the master would come and waited patiently for his return. Upon the death of his master, Hachiko continued his journey of walking to the station where his master would board and persisted on waiting even though his master had long passed. One morning, Hachiko didn\u2019t show up. The end.\nThe famous Shibuya crossing! It was smaller than I had imagined but was still an amazing sight to see all these busy humans.\nDAY 2: DISNEY SEA AND ODAIBA\nWe started our second day off at\nDisneySea\n\u2013\u00a0A unique disney with 7 different themes, all aquatic related.\nA short train ride away from DisneySea was\nOdaiba Island\n\u2013 We saw a famous earth protector \u2013 Gundam. There are also many shopping areas in Odaiba which is what makes it a hot tourist spot now. It was previously used as for defensive purposes.\nTokyo Bay \u2013 The coast line at the bottom of Odaiba\u2019s central walkway.\nDAY 3: TOKYO SKYTREE AND ROBOT RESTAURANT\nI\u2019ve stated it before in other posts but I\u2019ll say it again \u2013 The Japanese are amazing at building magnificent structures in the middle of a metropolis. We were able to visit one of these wonders on our third day in Tokyo. The\nTokyo Skytree\nis the tallest building in Japan and should be on your bucket list while visiting Japan.\nAfter our admiration of the Skytree, we headed to lower ground and visited the last temple of our visit. Temples represent peace, unity, collaboration, and reverence yet, Japan has many of these sacred stops in the middle of the city which is both an achievement and irony. I believe the best way to view it is: \u201cin the middle of chaos (the city) you can find peace (temples).\u201d\u00a0This was the Sensoji-Tokyo Pagoda.\nWe rounded up the busy day with\nRobot Restaurant\n\u2013 An onslaught of lights, sounds and movements. Talk about sensory overload! A high-pace tale told through Japanese style storytelling which means overly done costumes, personalities and body language. It was definitely worth the price ($70USD-$120USD) and great for all ages. The show has many variations so the show we saw may be vastly different from what you may see!\nDAY 4: TSUKIJI FISH MARKET AND HARAJUKU\nOn our last day in Tokyo, we visited my favorite spot \u2013\nTsukiji Fish Market\n. The best place I have ever eaten raw fish (and I\u2019m not too much of a raw fish lover). Tsukiji Market made me love fish and now I can\u2019t wait to go back for more! Nothing in Hawaii can compare, not even\nPaina Cafe\n. Although, it is a close competition to my taste buds.\nOur last and final stop in Japan, other than the airport, was Harajuku. Gwen Stafani made it famous with her song Harajuku Girls. However, many\u00a0urban styles originate from here and is a very flashy youth scene. It only gets better (and busier) as the night draws near.\nThere are MANY things to do and visit while in Tokyo and I\u2019m sure we were only able to scratch the surface. Four days to spend in a city as big as small countries is too short if you ask me. Possible our next visit we can spend a little more time in Tokyo, say a week? After visiting the \u201cmain\u201d attractions I\u2019m sure we can see and do more next time.\u00a0If you visited something not on our list, let us know so we can add it to our bucket list!\n(\nsource\n)\nPIN\u00a0IT!\n\u201cWe live in a rainbow of chaos.\u201d\n\u2013\nPaul Cezanne\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nRelated Posts\nONE MONTH IN SOUTHEAST ASIA IN ONE BACKPACK\n10 BEST THINGS TO DO IN NUSA PENIDA (3-DAY ITINERARY)\n10 BEST PLACES TO EAT IN OSAKA, JAPAN\nComments are closed.\nHOME\nABOUT\nDESTINATIONS\nASIA\nCHINA\nINDONESIA\nJAPAN\nMALAYSIA\nPHILIPPINES\nSINGAPORE\nTAIWAN\nCENTRAL AMERICA\nCOSTA RICA\nEUROPE\nENGLAND\nFRANCE\nGREECE\nHAWAII\nBIG ISLAND\nOAHU\nKAUAI\nMAUI\nNORTH AMERICA\nCANADA\nUSA\nALASKA\nARIZONA\nCALIFORNIA\nFLORIDA\nNEVADA\nNEW YORK\nWASHINGTON\nOCEANIA\nAUSTRALIA\nTRAVEL\nITINERARIES\nBEST THINGS TO\u2026\nTIPS\nSTORIES\nLIFESTYLE\nRECIPES\nWELLNESS\nREVIEWS\nACTIVITIES\nFOOD\nHOTELS\nPRODUCTS\nWORK WITH US"}]}

My preconception was that it\u2019s largely all for show, full of high rises and little soul. But last year I was away for my birthday in the freezing cold temperatures of Europe, and decided I needed sunshine this year instead. With only 5 days off work, I couldn\u2019t go too far \u2013 so the Middle East beckoned and I ended up settling on Dubai due to an amazing flight deal.\nIt is a crazy city, like a mega metropolis plonked in the middle of the desert. It\u2019s such a contrast \u2013 on the one hand you have traditional, reserved, Emirati culture (but local Emirati\u2019s make up only 11% of the country\u2019s population), and on the other you have mega corporations, glitz, glam and tourists galore (with ex-pats making up a whopping 88% of the population)!\nI\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s hard not to be drawn in by the glitz and glam, and it\u2019s really awe inspiring seeing what\u2019s been built here. It\u2019s fun to see the skyscrapers, get lost in the most ridiculous mall, eat all the delicious food, and enjoy all the OTT madness. Equally, I do think some of that is quite surface level and so it\u2019s also important to find glimpses of tradition, and to embrace some authentic Emirate culture, food and experiences too.\nSo my recommended itinerary for 2 days in this amazing city try to mix the two a bit. I hope you enjoy it!\nDubai views\nContents\nContents\nItinerary Day 1: Modern Dubai\nDubai Mall\nSouk al Bahar\nDubai Brunch\nBurj Khalifa & Park\nDubai Fountain (6pm onwards)\nThe View at 42 (Shangri-La Hotel)\nOptional: Souk Madinat Jumeirah & Burj Al Arab\nItinerary Day 2: Traditional Dubai\nGrand Bur Dubai Mosque\nAl Fahidi Historic Neighbourhood\nAl Khayma Heritage Restaurant\nDubai Creek\nJumeirah Mosque\nEtihad Museum\nOptional: Deira and Dubai Gold Souk\nHave a little longer?\nDubai Miracle Garden\nAya Universe\nDubai Desert\nGetting around in Dubai\nWhere to stay in Dubai?\nItinerary Day 1: Modern Dubai\nDubai Mall\nFull post:\nHERE\nWhere to even start. Dubai Mall is utterly INSANE. In what I can only describe as the most mega of all malls I\u2019ve ever stepped foot in, be prepared to spend at least a few hours here. We actually spent 7 hours inside the mall, and there\u2019s too much to cover here so I\u2019ve written a full guide above.\nAs a brief overview, you can visit any of the 1,200 shops, go ice skating on a full size ice rink, visit an aquarium, enjoy a huge arcade, see a dinosaur skeleton, taste your way through the food court, visit China Town, drive an F1 car, fly an Emirates plane simulator, get scared in a haunted house, walk an art trail, immerse yourself in VR, and even see an indoor waterfall!\nWaterfalls and China Town\nIce rinks and dinosaurs\nSouk al Bahar\nCrossing from the mall, through the park, brings you to a bridge across to Souk al Bahar. Home to shops which are more like very modern traditional souks (i.e. in a glam new building, but stock more traditional wears), you can get better deals and prices here but you need to haggle. I bought some fresh fruit, and haggling over my grapes was part of the fun.\nInside the modern Souk\nDubai Brunch\nAfter the mall, it\u2019s time to embrace a modern Dubai tradition; brunch. Normally served from 12pm \u2013 4pm, it\u2019s like a way of life here and around every corner we were offered Vietnamese, Mexican, Italian, Lebanese and Indian brunches. We had a couple of brunches whilst in the city \u2013 including Vietnamese at\nHoi An\n, and Chinese at\nNew Shanghai\n. Both were delicious, and there are lots of options in and around the mall to save you travelling.\nAll the delicious brunch food\nBurj Khalifa & Park\nFrom within Dubai Mall, you can visit\n\u2018At the Top\u2019\nwhich enables you to visit the top of Dubai\u2019s iconic Burj Khalifa. If heights aren\u2019t your thing then you can also view it from just outside the mall (follow the signs to the Dubai Fountain) where you get lovely views and can stroll around the parks outside.\nThe Burj and in the park\nDubai Fountain (6pm onwards)\nTo round off your day in and around the mall, head out of the Souk and towards Dubai Fountain in the evening. Every 30 minutes from 6pm \u2013 11pm (also at 1pm during the day), the amazing light show goes. It\u2019s different every time as well so even better if you get to see two sittings! It\u2019s really stunning and we had an absolutely amazing time watching it, though it does get busy.\nIf you want an extra special treat, book an evening table at\nAmal\nby Armani\nIndian restaurant. Situated within the Burj Khalifa in the Armani Hotel is the most delicious Indian with a balcony overlooking the fountain so you can watch the lightshow without the crowds. This was my birthday treat and we had a 3 course awesome meal, plus saw 5 rounds of the light show.\nThe fountain light show (L), and my dinner with a view (R)\nThe View at 42 (Shangri-La Hotel)\nFull review:\nHERE\nWe stayed at the Shangri-La, but whether you choose to stay there or not, you can finish off your modern Dubai day with a treat \u2013 one of the best views in the whole city! It\u2019s a short taxi ride from the Mall area and well worth it to look out to the Burj Khalifa and all the sprawling roads laid out in front of it by night. Magic.\nThe view at varying levels of night\nOptional: Souk Madinat Jumeirah & Burj Al Arab\nIf you don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to need as much time as we did in the Dubai Mall area, then I recommend starting your day in the wonderful area of Souk Madinat and Burj Al Arab (around a 15 minute drive from the Mall). This area is really beautiful to stroll around with lots of little shops, pretty buildings and views. You could also choose to take an Abra boat ride on the water for something extra special.\nIn the Souk (L) and its beautiful views (R)\nAdmirning the Burj al Arab (L), Souk entrance (R)\nItinerary Day 2: Traditional Dubai\nGrand Bur Dubai Mosque\nI always think it\u2019s important to understand more about what we don\u2019t live every day, and it was important to me coming to Dubai to understand more about Islam. I\u2019ve done mosque tours in the UK before, but also wanted to visit and learn more here too. We therefore went on the 9-10am tour at Grand Bur Mosque.\nI was given an Abaya to wear, and we were given an ablution demonstration, a tour of the Mosque\u2019s interior, a demonstration of the call to prayer and taken through the core beliefs of Islam. The mosque was beautiful inside, though of course I didn\u2019t take any photos as that wasn\u2019t appropriate.\nAt the mosque\nAl Fahidi Historic Neighbourhood\nThis was one of my favourite parts about visiting Dubai. Just a short walk from the Mosque, and miles away from modern Dubai is the old town area, home to traditional cafes, tea rooms, art galleries and even a traditional Emirati house to visit. We happily spent 2 hours wandering around and going in all the little shops and winding mazes of lanes.\nIn the historic district\nLovely\nAl Khayma Heritage Restaurant\nAfter a morning exploring, it was time to refuel, and where better than in a traditional Emirati restaurant. There are plenty in the area and we settled on\nAl Khayma\n, which was absolutely delicious! The food was insane. So insane it went straight in my mouth and I forgot to take any photos which is always the best compliment I can give a meal!\nDubai Creek\nThe creek forms a natural port, and actually stretches for around 15km, weaving through modern Dubai as a reminder of its past in the fishing and pearl industries. It\u2019s hard to believe that just 50 years ago, barely any of the city we see today was here \u2013 rather it was mainly desert with smaller dwellings. Its change over the course of the last few decades has been incredible, and has to be admired. Today the creek is still busy, and offers boat tours across to Deira and its gold souks, or inland all the way to the Burj.\nViews along the creek\nJumeirah Mosque\nFrom the creek we headed to the Etihad Museum, but first stopped at Jumierah Mosque (just a short walk from the museum) to see it from the outside. It\u2019s truly beautiful.\nWalking by Jumeirah Mosque\nEtihad Museum\nTo round off our day of learning and experiencing something new, we headed to the Etihad Museum. Etihad in Arabic means \u2018United\u2019, which made me chuckle as it means Manchester City play in a shirt with \u2018United\u2019 written right across the front \u2013 how ironic.\nThe futuristic museum\nAnyways, to the museum. The museum is underground, with a huge futuristic glass atrium on top. It is effectively paying homage to the 7 leaders of the various Emirates who came together in the 1970s, post the British colonial powers withdrawing from the area, to form one country. The same 7 Emirates still exist today, all with their own leaders \u2013 though unified with the ruler of Abu Dhabi as the main leader of the UAE. The museum was unsurprisingly very positive about its leaders and it felt a bit like a shrine, though we did learn quite a bit we hadn\u2019t previously appreciated about this region\u2019s rich and complex history.\nAnd inside\nOptional: Deira and Dubai Gold Souk\nIf the mosque tour or museum aren\u2019t for you in Day 2\u2019s itinerary, then make sure that instead you cross Dubai Creek to visit Deira and the Gold Souk, as it\u2019s another beautiful historic area in the city.\nWe\u2019d planned to include this, and hop on a traditional Abra boat to cross the Creek to the gold souk but we actually ran out of time (not helped by my husband damaging his foot the day before so we were on a slow to hobbling pace).\nDubai Gold Souk (courtesy of Traveladdicts.com as we didn\u2019t manage to visit)\nHave a little longer?\nIf you have longer in Dubai, there are lots of other amazing things to do, and you could easily spend another few days in the city exploring.\nDubai Miracle Garden\nFull Post:\nHERE\nDubai Miracle Garden is true madness. Open only during winter, it\u2019s an amazing flower attraction, including everything from Disney castles to aeroplanes to Smurf villages. A visit will take around 2 \u2013 3 hours.\nExploring the gardens\nPretty installations\nAya Universe\nFull Post:\nHERE\nAnother unique Dubai experience is to visit Aya, an interactive light art installation which is a bit mind bogglingly fun.\nEnjoying Aya\nIn the exhibition\nDubai Desert\nDubai is a city literally built in the middle of the desert, and only a short 30-45 minutes drive out will find you amongst the sand dunes. We had a desert evening meal one night to watch the sunset and it was really beautiful. You could also go dune buggying, camel riding or sand boarding \u2013 take your pick!\nDinner set up in the desert\nGetting around in Dubai\nDubai is not a walkable city. Google maps might say 1.4km but it\u2019s normally along a 6 way highway. The roads and traffic are busy and I really don\u2019t recommend walking anywhere unless places are literally next door.\nThe main attractions (e.g. Mall, Historic District, Miracle Garden, Jumeirah Beach etc) are nowhere near each other (like 40 minute drives in some cases), so you will be dependent on transport.\nThere is a metro but it runs to limited stops, though the Mall is one (assuming your hotel is anywhere near). Unfortunately it means taxis are the way forward in Dubai \u2013 we used\nUber\nduring our stay with no issues. They are fairly good value, safe and reliable here.\nMore Dubai sites\nWhere to stay in Dubai?\nWe stayed in the absolutely amazing\nShangri-La Dubai\n. It was a full on dose of mega-metropolis sensory overload with everything on offer from Vietnamese Brunch to floating breakfasts and epic rooftop views across the city.\nThe Shangri-La pool and terrace (on my birthday)\nIf you want something more traditional,\nAl Seef Heritage Hotel\nlooks amazing. If you\u2019re all about the beach you might prefer to base yourself at Jumeirah in a hotel like the\nMandarin Oriental\n, and if you want ultimate bragging rights for the most luxurious postcode in town you could stay on The Palm Jumeirah and splash on somewhere like\nAtlantis The Palm\n(you could even get your own underwater suite in an aquarium for a mere \u00a35k a night -ha!). Finally, if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of the city completely, you could stay in the Dubai Desert \u2013 the epitome of luxury is\nAl Maha\n, or you could go for the (only slightly) less pricy option\nBab Al Shams\n.\nSo, what do you think of Dubai?

I really do want to go and see its incredible modernity, especially that it\u2019s transformed tremendously over the past few decades (before, it was all desert)! However, I hesitate to, as the UAE and Qatar have a history of human rights issue, e.g. workers exploitation from third-world countries, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll head there anytime soon.

Then again, this post sent me on a bit of a google search to see exactly where the MN mall ranks. I thought it was biggest in the world, but not at all. It\u2019s like 12th or something. Maybe it used to be when it was first built? Anyway, all these \u201cbiggests\u201d get out-bigged at one point or another. It must be exhausting to constantly try to outdo each other.\nAnyway, Dubai looks interesting, if overwhelming. A bit like Vegas on steroids. The desert dinner would be a nice break from all the overstimulation. You\u2019re so lucky to live in Europe where Dubai is doable with just 5 days off. Even doing Portugal over spring break was a bit of a stretch, time-wise. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d go to Dubai as an end-point destination (though, weirdly, I\u2019m interested in going to Singapore), but as a stop on the way to somewhere I would definitely do it, though it sounds like two weeks is what\u2019s needed \u2013 haha!

I\ngot the most epic itinerary\nfor you!\nDubai dazzles with its sheer scale and opulence, and it can feel a bit overwhelming to figure out where to start\u2014especially when you only have 3 days.\nHaving spent my childhood in India, Dubai was always that mesmerizing oasis just a hop away. Its transformation from a desert to the futuristic metropolis has fascinated me ever since.

This is the\nperfect Dubai itinerary for first time visitors.\nLet\u2019s dive into how to spend three incredible days in Dubai!\nDownload our FREE Travel Checklist & Planner\nTable of Contents\nToggle\n3 DAYS IN DUBAI ITINERARY\nDAY 1 (Downtown Dubai, Burj Khalifa & Dubai Mall)\nLet\u2019s start Day 1 at the crown jewel of Dubai \u2013\nBurj Khalifa and the incredible Dubai Mall in Downtown.\nIf it is your first time, I highly\nrecommend staying in Dubai Downtown\narea as it is close to major attractions and makes it super easy to access Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall.\nPalace Downtown\nis my favorite hotel\nto stay here. It is luxurious with traditional Middle-Eastern decor and their service is impeccable.\nThe staff service is incredible and they were so generous during our visit and gladly served lemon ginger tea at odd hours as we were sick during our visit.\nMorning: Breakfast at Palace Downtown with Burj Khalifa Views\nBegin your first day with a delicious\nbreakfast at\nEwaan\nin\nPalace Downtown hotel.\nThis hotel has one of the most incredible breakfast spreads I\u2019ve ever seen.\nThey serves a delicious mix of Middle Eastern dishes from pistachio croissants, scrumptious date spread as well as continental, Indian, Asian breakfast options.\nBe sure to enjoy the\nbreakfast with unbeatable views of the Burj Khalifa from the terrace.\nHead to the observation deck of Burj Khalifa\nAfter breakfast,\nhead to the Burj Khalifa,\nthe tallest building in the world, standing at 828 meters (2,717 feet).\nWhile I prefer the breathtaking views of the Burj from other vantage points, I highly recommend touring the Burj Khalifa.\nIt is not everyday that you get to visit the\nworld\u2019s tallest building\nand take the evelator that goes 10m/sec!\nThe Burj Khalifa\u2019s\nAt the Top\nobservation decks on the 124th and 125th floors\nprovide jaw-dropping panoramic views of Dubai skyline, the Arabian Gulf, and the surrounding desert.\nYou can\nbuy the tickets\nhere.\nOption to Go Higher:\nFor an even more luxurious experience, you can upgrade to\nAt the Top Sky\non the 148th floor\n, which is\nthe highest observation deck in the world at 555 meters (1,821 feet).\nThe 148th floor is a 90-minute experience and provides exclusive lounge access.\nI love architecture and learning about the incredible achievements to make this building possible so here are a few fun facts about the Burj Khalifa:\nBurj Khalifa has 163 floors and took six years to complete, opening to the public in 2010.\nThe elevator to the observation deck is among the fastest in the world, reaching speeds of 10 meters per second.\nThe Burj\u2019s design was inspired by traditional Islamic architecture and the shape of a desert flower.\nThe most mind blowing fact for me is that the Burj  can sway as much as 2 meters at its tallest point!\nLunch and a stroll at Souk Al Bahar\nWalk over to\nSouk Al Bahar\n, a charming Arabian-style market\njust across a bridge from the Dubai Mall.\nThis traditional shopping complex offers a unique blend of Middle Eastern crafts, jewelry, perfumes, and souvenirs.\nIt is one of my favorite spots to take\nInstagram worthy photos in Dubai.\nThe architecture is so beautiful and very traditional.\nStop for\nlunch at one of the many options in Souk Al Bahar\nwith views of Burj Khalifa\nMy favorite restaurants are\nAsado\n: Asado is an upscale Argentinian steakhouse with Arabic-inspired decor.\nAbd el Wahab:\nMy favorite high-end Lebanese restaurant offers incredible views of the Burj Khalifa and Dubai Fountain, with a menu of traditional Lebanese favorites.\nSerafina Dubai:\nItalian restaurant in Souk Al Bahar with an open terrace and unobstructed views of the Burj.\nPowered by\nGetYourGuide\nAfternoon:\nDubai Mall and Dubai Aquarium\nEven in the winter months, Dubai is hot and humid. In order to avoid the afternoon heat, I highly recommend staying indoors exploring the mall or museums.\nYou can\u2019t go to Dubai and not shop at the\nlargest shopping mall in the world\n! Dubai Mall is the right place for some retail therapy.\nFrom ultra high end luxury to daily fashion,\nDubai Mall\nhas the best selection of over 200 stores. You can\ntake advantage of the VAT refund\nand shop luxury brands here.\nOne of the highlights within Dubai Mall is the\nDubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo.\nStroll through the immersive tunnel where sharks, rays, and other sea creatures swim overhead.\nWhile it a must-visit, I felt it to be a\ntad expensive for an aquarium.\nI did visit anyway because my toddler loves visiting aquariums. We went at 10am to avoid the crowds and it was worth it.\nDubai Mall is also home to an amusement park, ice skating rink as well as gaming rooms if you are into them.\nAlso don\u2019t miss\nArabica Coffee in Dubai Mall.\nIt is one of the\nmost Instagrammable cafes in Dubai.\nEvening:\nDubai Fountain Show and Dinner with Fountain Views\nOne of my favorite things to do in the\nevening in Dubai is to watch the Dubai Fountain show\n, one of the\nmost mesmerizing shows\nin the city!\nThe fountains dance to a mix of classical, Arabic, and pop tunes, with a\nlight show in the water against the backdrop of the Burj Khalifa.\nThe Dubai\nFountain Show is free\nto watch and can be viewed from many vantage points around from the Dubai Mall, Souq Al Bahar and Palace Downtown.\nHowever, my favorite way to watch the show while avoiding the crowds is by\nbooking an abra boat ride and view the show with unobstructed views\nall around.\nBoats depart regularly from the Dubai Fountain Promenade near the Dubai Mall\u2019s waterfront exit. Don\u2019t miss this activity especially if you have little ones.\nCap off your day with dinner at a restaurant overlooking the fountains. Here are some excellent choices:\nThiptara:\nLocated in the Palace Downtown, Thiptara serves Thai cuisine with a prime view of the fountain.\nSocial House:\nWith trendy atmosphere and diverse menu, Social House is a fantastic spot to enjoy the fountain show.\nZeta Seventy Seven:\nSituated on the rooftop, this chic restaurant offers contemporary Asian dishes with spectacular views of the Dubai Fountain.\nDAY 2 (Old Dubai, Souks And Sunset Dunes Desert Tour)\nDay 2 in Dubai is all about exploring\nOld Dubai\nand its traditions. This is perhaps how Dubai would have been had oil not been discovered.\nEven though I love the comfort of luxury, I also love learning about the history of the places I visit. I make a point to learn about the historic origins and old way of living.\nAnd Dubai\u2019s history is surely fascinating.\nIt is one of the reasons why I found Bur Dubai (especially Al Fahidi historical neighborhood, Al Seef) endlessly fascinating, from the unique architecture of traditional wind towers (designed to cool buildings naturally in Dubai\u2019s heat) to the trade legacy of the district.\nIt was incredible to learn about how the story of Dubai\u2019s roots as a modest fishing and pearl-diving community to its emergence as a modern marvel.\nMorning in Al Fahidi District and Al Seef\nStart with a leisurely\nwalk through Al Seef\u2019s waterfront promenade,\nwhere you\u2019ll find charming artisan shops, heritage displays and even a unique\nStarbucks housed in a traditional building.\nWhile the area is touristy, I recommend browsing the endless display of shops with traditional lamps, lights and artisanal crafts.\nWalk around the\nhistoric Al Fahidi District, also known as Bastakiya.\nEstablished in the late 19th century by Persian merchants, Al Fahidi is one of Dubai\u2019s oldest neighborhoods, with narrow lanes, wind towers, and mud-brick buildings.\nBastakiya is filled with\nart galleries, museums,\nand cultural centers dedicated to preserving Dubai\u2019s heritage.\nIf you love museums, check out the\nDubai Museum, located in the 200-year-old Al Fahidi Fort.\nIt shows a glimpse of the desert life and early Bedouin settlements\u00a0of Dubai.\nThis part of the city feels like a world away from the towering skyscrapers of Downtown Dubai.\nEarly lunch at Arabian Tea House\nArabian Tea House is steps away from Dubai Museum and a great place to stop for lunch.\nFor an\nauthentic taste of Emirati cuisine,\na visit to this cafe is a must. Did I mention that it is also one of the\nmost Instagrammable cafes in Dubai\n?\nThis\npopular spot has a beautiful garden and courtyard\nwith blue benches, white canopies, and flowering plants, making it a perfect backdrop for photoshoot or Instagram.\nThe food and drinks are delicious as well. My favorites are\ntraditional Arabic tea\n(lightly sweetened and infused with mint),\nthe Mezze platter and Machboos.\nTo visit traditional souks or markets, check out nearby\nDeira Grand Souk or the Gold Souk just across the Dubai Creek.\nIt is a one of a kind place with gold ornaments of all kinds including vests made of gold.\nIf you have more days to spare, I suggest spending a day here exploring the shops, taking the Dhow cruise or abra boat along Dubai Creek.\nPowered by\nGetYourGuide\nEvening\nRed Dunes Sunset Tour and BBQ dinner\nEnd your second day with a\ndesert safari tour.\nAn evening desert safari is the best option. Your 3 days in Dubai will not be complete without spending time in the desert.\nIf you love the desert vibes and would like a unique experience, I highly recommend an unforgettable adventure involving\nsunset photography in the red dunes, camel rides and a traditional dinner along with stargazing at a Bedouin camp.\nIf you prefer a more thrilling experience, you can include a safari along with dune bashing in a 4\u00d74 but we chose the former as it is kid friendly.\nThe\ndinner under the stars\nwas an incredible experience. The camp serves a wide spread of Middle Eastern and barbecue dishes, including kebabs, hummus, falafel, and traditional bread.\nAn added bonus is live performances including belly dancing and music, my daughter\u2019s favorite! \ud83d\ude42\nDownload our FREE Travel Checklist & Planner\nDAY 3 (Beach day, Dubai Marina and Palm Jumeirah)\nPowered by\nGetYourGuide\nMorning beach time and Dubai Marina\nA\nbeach day with turquoise waters,\nsoft sands is a must on your Dubai trip itinerary.\nStart your day at\nJBR beach\nlocated at\nThe Walk at JBR\n(Jumeirah Beach Residence).\nEnjoy beach activities, or rent a sunbed and unwind while taking in views of the iconic Ain Dubai Ferris wheel on Bluewaters Island.\nChoose from a variety of\nbeachfront cafes and restaurants along\nThe Walk at JBR\n.\nThis is a popular area for expats.\nAlternatively,\nJumeirah Beach is quieter,\nmore peaceful with great views of the Burj Al Arab.\nAfter some time at JBR Beach,\nexplore\u00a0Dubai Marina,\na bustling waterfront district known for its skyscrapers and luxury yachts.\nStroll along the\u00a0Dubai Marina Walk, a 7-kilometer path lined with chic cafes, boutiques, and restaurants.\nEnjoy lunch at one of the many incredible restaurants in Dubai Marina with great views of the Marina.\nPalm Jumeirah and The Atlantis\nPalm Jumeirah, a man-made island shaped like a palm tree is another architectural marvel of Dubai.\nIt is home to\nluxury hotels, fine dining, and popular attractions,\nmaking it a must-see for first-time visitors.\nFun fact:\nPalm Jumeirah is one of the most expensive parts of Dubai\nand home to the famous billionaires row!\nTo\ncatch a panoramic view of Palm Jumeirah and Dubai\u2019s skyline, head to\nThe View at The Palm\n,\nlocated in the Palm Tower.\nAn alternative to this is a\nhelicopter tour or sky diving\nfor something more adventurous!\nOne of these adventures is a must add to your Dubai travel itinerary if you \u2018d like to get a bird\u2019s eye view of Dubai!\nDon\u2019t forget to stop by\nAtlantis, The Palm,\nlocated at the tip of the Palm.

This is the information you need to ensure your Dubai trip runs smoothly.\nHow many days in Dubai?\nFirst questions first, how many days do you actually need in Dubai?\nBeing a city, many travellers think Dubai doesn\u2019t need that long to be discovered, but they couldn\u2019t be more wrong! The city is huge, and transfers between places can take their time.\nPersonally, I think the bare minimum amount of time you should spend in Dubai is three days. Some travellers try to see as much as possible during\nlong layovers in Dubai\n, but that\u2019s nowhere near enough time.\nThis will allow you to see all the main sights, have time to relax on the beach and properly get a feel for the unique vibe of this city.\nThe iconic pink Atlantis The Palm as seen from The Pointe, Dubai\nIf you want to go beyond the main tourist attractions of Dubai, and live unique experiences like spending a night in the desert or seeing the Presidential Palace of Abu Dhabi, then you will need longer in Dubai.\nIn this article I have outlined my core Dubai 3-day itinerary, and then built on top of that to form itineraries for four days, five days, six days and even seven days in Dubai.\nDepending on how long you have, and your personal interests, you can expand your trip to the full Dubai 7-day itinerary, or maybe just pick and choose specific days to form a Dubai 5-day itinerary.\nAlthough three days is enough, if you have the time for a Dubai 7-day itinerary, that is what I would personally go for, as it will allow you to really see everything this unique city, and its surroundings, have to offer.\nThe entrance of Palace Hotel and Burj Khalifa in Dubai\nHow to get around Dubai\nDubai is a huge city, and making your way around it can be complicated, but don\u2019t let that deter you. Between public transport and taxis, you can easily make your way around Dubai.\nDubai has an efficient metro system, the Dubai Metro. It runs mostly parallel to the sea and Sheikh Zayed Road. It\u2019s a rapid transit rail network that does 53 stops and covers most of the main areas of Dubai.\nFares for the Dubai Metro depend on how far you\u2019re travelling. You can purchase tickets at every metro station, get daily passes or get a Nol card to top up.\nIt\u2019s perfect for getting to the main spots (for example the malls have entrances directly connected to the Metro system, so you don\u2019t have to walk outside in the heat), but if you\u2019re trying to go smaller side streets, walking from the Metro station can be annoying.\nFor short distances, or for journeys to places that aren\u2019t on the Metro line, I recommend either an Uber or taxi. I was surprised to find that taxis in Dubai are comparatively cheap (a 20km journey is around 50 AED).\nDiscovering Al Seef, the historical area of Dubai\nBest time to visit Dubai\nDubai is a very popular winter sun destination.\nBeing located in the middle of the desert, Dubai has a hot and dry climate all year round. In winter that means temperatures around 20-25\u00b0C, but in summer it can go up to over 40\u00b0C.\nGenerally speaking, the best time of the year to visit Dubai is from early November to end of March. Perfect if you\u2019re looking to escape from\nwinter in Europe\n!\nView over the Dubai Marina & JBR skyline from The View at The Palm\nWhere to stay in Dubai\nThere are loads of\ncool places to stay in Dubai\n, and the perfect place for you ultimately depends on your travel style and budget. I have listed below some cool options for every budget.\nBudget:\nRove Dubai Marina\n\u2013 This is a perfect option for budget travellers. It\u2019s just a short stroll from Jumeirah Beach, as well as shopping and dining options. The hotel also has a chic outdoor pool and restaurant.\nClick here to book your stay at Rove Dubai Marina!\nMid-range:\n25hours Hotel One Central\n\u2013 I spent one night here and loved it. This hotel\u00a0has an epic rooftop pool with a view of the Museum of the Future, and the interior design is truly unique. It\u2019s one of the most\nInstagrammable spots in Dubai\nfor a reason!\nClick here to book your stay at 25hours Hotel One Central!\nLuxury:\nAddress Downtown Dubai\n\u2013 Among other things, this luxury hotel features an incredible infinity pool with an equally incredible view of Burj Khalifa: the world\u2019s tallest building.\u00a0The location in Downtown Dubai is prime for exploring top sights, and the spacious rooms offer a luxurious experience.\nClick here to book your stay at Address Downtown Dubai!\nEnjoying the pool with view over the Museum of the Future at 25hours Hotel One Central in Dubai\nBest tours in Dubai\nIf you follow the advice in this Dubai itinerary, you\u2019ll easily be able to discover Dubai independently without having to join a tour.\nHaving said that, there are definitely some experiences worth splurging for, or entrance tickets to certain attractions that you have to book online beforehand. I have listed the most popular below.\nHelicopter Flight from The Palm to Burj Khalifa\n\u2013 The tour name is pretty self explanatory, if you want a truly adrenaline inducing and unique experience, this is it! See the iconic Dubai skyline from the sky!\nDubai Old Town, Souks & Street Food Guided Tour\n\u2013 Discover the historical parts of Dubai with a knowledgeable local guide, from the souks to the street food, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\nEnjoying the Dubai skyline lit up for the night from Burj Khalifa\nFrom Dubai: Abu Dhabi Premium Full-Day Sightseeing Tour\n\u2013 The most complete Dubai to Abu Dhabi day trip, it includes all of the major sights, transfers and lunch.\nBurj Khalifa Ticket & Tour: Level 124, 125 & 148\n\u2013 See the amazing view from Burj Khalifa, without having to waste hours queueing!\nFrom Dubai: Red Dunes and Camel Safari with Overnight Camp\n\u2013 Want to do something truly unique and spend a night in the desert?

Personally, I suggest getting your travel insurance with\nHeymondo\n.\nHeymondo\noffers tailor made travel insurance, providing the best value for money for your specific trip. You can also buy it once you\u2019re already abroad and have forgotten about it before flying (which, if you\u2019re anything like me, is quite likely).\nBesides the usual cancellation, medical expenses, luggage coverage and general travel insurance services,\nHeymondo\nalso has a 24/7 doctor chat and instant assistance through their app.\nAs a Greta\u2019s Travels reader, you get 5% off your\nHeymondo travel insurance\n!\nClick here to get your 5% off Heymondo travel insurance!\nExploring the Spice Souk of Dubai\nWhat to pack for Dubai\nWhen planning\nwhat to pack for Dubai\nyou\u2019ll soon realise it\u2019s not as simple as the usual\ntravel essentials\n. Being a Muslim country, you will have to dress more conservatively in certain occasions.\nHowever, Dubai is famous for its malls, so if you do realise you\u2019re missing something, you can just buy it once there! That said, here are the things I would make sure to pack.\nHead scarf for women\n\u2013 If you plan on visiting the Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi (which you really should be) then you have to remember to bring a scarf to cover your hair. You won\u2019t be allowed in without one.\nModest clothing that fully covers you\n\u2013 This goes for both men and women.\nDress codes in Dubai vary depending on the situations, but it\u2019s good to have some\nlong loose trousers\nand\nbreathable long sleeved shirts\n, so as to comply with the dress code but also not overheat in the hot Emirati weather!\nThe Wings of Mexico statue in Downtown Dubai\nCamera\n\u2013 Given how beautiful Dubai is, you want to make sure you capture it in all its beauty!\nReusable water bottle\n\u2013 Especially if you plan to do a lot of walking, bring a bottle you can refill and ensure you stay hydrated. It will save you money and you\u2019ll also waste less plastic, it\u2019s a win-win!\nPower bank\n\u2013 Whether it\u2019s while snapping some pictures, while google mapping your way around the city or ordering an uber, you don\u2019t want your phone to run out of battery during a crucial moment!\nInternational adapter\n\u2013 In Dubai you\u2019ll find type G sockets and plugs (like the UK ones). Depending on where you\u2019re from, you might need an adapter to charge your electronics.\nThe famous Palm of Dubai at sunset\nDubai itinerary 3 days\nLet\u2019s start with my core Dubai 3-day itinerary! If you can\u2019t stay long in Dubai, make sure to stay at least three days, and hit all the highlights I\u2019ve outlined below.\nDubai itinerary day 1 \u2013 Dubai Marina\nMorning \u2013 Discover Dubai Marina\nI couldn\u2019t start a Dubai itinerary in any other location. Dubai Marina is one of the most iconic areas of Dubai.\nWith its white sand beach, tall skyscrapers, fun beach clubs, and countless dining and drinking opportunities, it\u2019s what everyone imagines when they think of Dubai.\nI recommend wandering around Dubai Marina in the morning, before it gets too hot.\nYou can walk along the man-made marina, enjoying the views of traditional dhow boats and\nmodern yachts\ncruising past, with the iconic Dubai skyscrapers as backdrop.\nWalking along Dubai Marina\nThere are plenty of cafes, restaurants and shops where you can stop for a quick breakfast, and maybe a bit of shopping throughout the morning.\nFrom the food court of Dubai Marina Mall you will get an incredible view over Dubai Marina, and the best part, it\u2019s completely free!\nAs the morning turns into afternoon and the day grows hotter, you can head to the beach to cool down! If you want to try some truly unique experiences, I have listed some popular tours below.\nDubai Marina Yacht Tour with Breakfast or BBQ\n\u2013 This is perfect for a group of friends or a special occasion, as you\u2019ll get to cruise past the iconic Dubai Marina skyline on a luxury yacht!\nHelicopter Flight from The Palm to Burj Khalifa\n\u2013 The tour name is pretty self explanatory, if you want a truly adrenaline inducing and unique experience, this is it! See the iconic Dubai skyline from the sky!\nIconic views of Dubai Marina\nAfternoon \u2013 Relax at JBR & Marina Beach\nJust beyond the skyscrapers of Dubai Marina, you will find JBR Beach and Marina Beach waiting for you.\nBeing the first day in Dubai, I imagine you will also want to relax after your flight, and what better place to do so?\nHere you will find both private beach clubs, as well as public stretches of beach. If you plan to stay here a while, I definitely recommend investing in a sun bed and umbrella, as the beaches in Dubai can get very hot!\nThere are also plenty of bars, restaurants and cafes on the seaside walk behind the beach, so you don\u2019t need to worry about going hungry or thirsty while you\u2019re at the beach.\nA traditional wooden dhow boat in Dubai Marina\nJBR & Dubai Marina as seen from The View at The Palm\nIf you\u2019re travelling with children, you\u2019ll find plenty of fun activities at JBR and Marina Beach also for them.\nFrom inflatable slides to banana boat tours, or from camel rides to\njet skis\n, these beaches offer plenty of activities.\nYou could just lie there and tan all afternoon, but if you\u2019re afraid of getting bored, no need to worry as there\u2019s plenty to do!\nYou could also cross the bridge to Bluewaters, a man-made island with loads of bars, restaurants and shops, as well as the new wheel and viewpoint of Dubai; Ain Dubai.\nI love Bluewaters also because it offers a great view of the Dubai Marina skyline.\nEnjoying the view over Dubai Marina & JBR at sunset from Bluewaters\nDinner \u2013 Dhow Dinner Cruise in Dubai Marina\nAfter a quick stop at your hotel to wash off the salt and sand, it\u2019s time to get all dressed up and head back to Dubai Marina, for a traditional dhow cruise and dinner.\nI went on a\ndhow cruise and dinner in Dubai Marina\non my last trip to Dubai, and I don\u2019t know why I waited six trips to finally do so!\nDhows are the traditional wooden boats of the UAE. Today, they are mostly used for tourist cruises, especially for dinner or afternoon tea.\nDoing a dhow dinner cruise in Dubai Marina is obviously a very touristy activity, but like I always say, touristy things are popular for a reason.\nWooden dhow boats cruising in Dubai Marina\nThe top deck of our Dubai dhow cruise, where you will enjoy your dinner\nYou can\u2019t travel to Rome and skip the Colosseum just because it\u2019s \u201ctouristy\u201d. It\u2019s a must on every\ntravel bucket list\n, and rightly so.\nThe same goes for\ndhow dinner cruises in Dubai\n. Seeing the skyline of Dubai lit up for the night, while cruising along the sea and eating delicious local food, is an experience like no other.\nMost dhow cruises will include also pick-up and drop-off from your hotel, so you don\u2019t have to worry about transfers.\nClick here to book your dhow dinner cruise in Dubai!\nOr check out prices & availability below!\nEnjoying the view over Bluewaters Island and Ain Dubai from the top deck of our dhow cruise\nDubai itinerary day 2 \u2013 Old Dubai Meets Modern\nMorning \u2013 Discover old Dubai\nAfter the skyscrapers of Dubai Marina, get ready to discover an older and more traditional side of Dubai. This morning we will head to Deira and Al Fahidi, the older areas of Dubai, which are also home to the souks.\nIn Deira you will find the Gold Souk and Spice Souk, two of the most iconic souks of Dubai. The sprawling souks are characterised by countless winding alleys, lined with all sorts of shops.\nAs the names suggest, you can expect to find jewellery and spices, but there are also many shops in the souks selling souvenirs, clothing, fine silks and more.\nIt\u2019s the perfect place to go for a wander, and discover a less known side of Dubai.\nExploring the souqs of Dubai, close to Deira\nSome of the gold shops in the gold souk in Dubai\nJust across the creek (which you can cross in a traditional abra wooden boat for around 1 AED) you will find Bur Dubai.\nThis is another area with souks and shops, where you can find everything from clothing to souvenirs.\u00a0As you walk through the souks you will emerge next to Al Fahidi, the historical district of Dubai.\nThere are less shops present here, but you can spend a bit of time wandering around the traditional streets, and getting a feel for what old Dubai was like.\nCrossing the Creek of Dubai in a traditional Abra wooden boat\nDiscovering the streets of Al Fahidi historical district in Dubai\nIn Al Fahidi we had lunch at Arabian Tea House Restaurant & Cafe. It\u2019s a lovely traditional restaurant, with a beautiful interior decor and delicious dishes like fattoush, falafel or meat wraps, and main dishes like Biryani.\nBefore leaving the magical atmosphere of old Dubai, you can pop by Al Seef, another historical area of Dubai. It\u2019s very similar to Al Fahidi, so if you\u2019re short on time, you don\u2019t necessarily have to visit both.\nDubai is a super safe city, but if you don\u2019t feel like wandering around the souks alone, then you can join a\nguided tour like this one\n.\nDiscover the souks, old town, creek and even some delicious local street food with this guided tour!\nClick here to book your Dubai Old Town, Souks & Street Food tour, or check out prices &\u00a0availability in the calendar below!\nThe gorgeous exterior of Arabian Tea House in Al Fahidi historical district in Dubai\nAfternoon \u2013 Sky Views Observatory & Dubai Mall\nAfter your morning exploring old Dubai, it\u2019s time to head to some of the most modern and unique sights in Dubai. Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall!\nLocated in Address Sky View (accessible from the Dubai Mall metro station), you will find Sky Views Observatory, the latest\nviewpoint in Dubai\n.\nEntrance costs around 20 EUR per person, I recommend\npurchasing it online beforehand\nso you don\u2019t have to queue once there.\nFrom Sky Views you get an epic view of Burj Khalifa, as well as the surrounding cityscapes of Dubai. But what makes this viewpoint special, is the glass slide, the glass walkway and the Sky Edge Walk.\nThis isn\u2019t just a place where you go and look at a view, you can truly engage with it in unique and adrenaline pumping ways. It\u2019s not every day that you get to hang off the side of a 53-floor building!\nClick here to purchase your Sky Views Skip-the-Line Entry Ticket, or check out prices &\u00a0availability below!\nSliding down the glass slide of Sky Views Observatory in Dubai\nOnce you\u2019ve had your epic views and adrenaline fix, you can go for a wander inside Dubai Mall.\nDubai Mall is the second largest mall in the world, home to over 1,200 retail stores. Whatever it is you\u2019re searching for, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll find it here. It\u2019s even home to Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo!\nJust outside Dubai Mall you\u2019ll find the Burj Khalifa water fountains. You actually get the best view of the fountains from the Apple Store inside Dubai Mall!\nThe fountains are on every 30 minutes from 6PM to 11PM, every day of the week, although it can vary depending on the time of the year or if there are public holidays on.\nI was last in Dubai during Ramadan, and then fountain show started later than usual.\nTime your sightseeing, viewpoint admiring and shopping so as to arrive at the fountains in time for one of the shows!\nDubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo, inside Dubai Mall\nThe ice skating rink inside Dubai Mall\nSunset & Evening \u2013 Burj Khalifa\nAfter enjoying the Burj Khalifa fountain show, head over to Burj Khalifa (the entrance is inside Dubai Mall).\nWith its 828 metres, Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world, wanting to admire the view from its top is only natural!\nSeeing the view from the top of Burj Khalifa is one of the most popular things to do in Dubai, and as such, it can get incredibly busy.\nI\u2019ve been twice before on separate Dubai trips, and have a few pointers to ensure you have the best visit possible.\nEnjoying the view over Dubai at night from the Burj Khalifa\nIf you can, I 100% recommend splurging on one of the premium experiences like the\nskip-the-line ticket, visiting floor 148\nor the\nticket with lunch or dinner at the Burj Club\n.\nThe normal ticket with entrance to floors 124 and 125 is what everyone does, and the queue gets gigantic.\nOn my last trip, we had to queue for over an hour just to get to the lift! We spent a few hours enjoying the view and taking photos, and then had to queue a good 30 minutes to get back down.\nThe premium skip-the-line tickets will avoid you this hassle.\u00a0The best time to go to the top of Burj Khalifa is at sunset, as you can see the whole change in the colours of the sky and Dubai skyline.\nThe view over Dubai at night from Burj Khalifa\nStanding at 452m (the height of floor 124), watching the sky turn pink and then dark, and the skyscrapers of Dubai light up below you is a unique experience.\nEven if you purchase a skip-the-line entrance, it can take a while to get to the viewing platform, so make sure to time your visit accordingly and don\u2019t miss the sunset!\nDubai Burj Khalifa Level 124 & 125 Entry Ticket\n\u2013 This is the basic entrance ticket to Burj Khalifa. With this you can go up to the viewing platform, and enjoy the stunning views.\nBurj Khalifa Ticket & Tour: Level 124, 125 & 148\n\u2013 Here you\u2019ll find the skip-the-line entrance, as well as access to the higher viewing deck at level 148, and a guided tour experience to top it all off!\nBurj Khalifa 124 & Lunch or Dinner at The Burj Club\n\u2013 The premium experience, which goes beyond the viewing deck and includes a delicious meal!\nEnjoying the view over Dubai at night from the top of Burj Khalifa\nAfter spending some time enjoying the view, if you don\u2019t go for the Burj Khalifa entrance with dinner, you can head back down and eat at Dubai Mall.\nWe ate at Al Hallab, a tasty Lebanese restaurant with outdoor seating and a view of the Burj Khalifa fountains.\nThe Burj Khalifa and Fountain Show as seen from the Al Hallab outdoor terrace\nDay 3 \u2013 Barasti Beach & The Palm\nMorning \u2013 Mall of the Emirates\nWhen it comes to malls, there are countless malls in Dubai that you could visit. Having visited Dubai Mall already, I think the next one that can\u2019t miss on any Dubai itinerary is Mall of the Emirates.\nMall of the Emirates is famous for being home to Ski Dubai; an indoor ski resort. You read that right, you could be baking under the hot desert sun one day, and then skiing at -1\u00b0C the next on the same trip!\nBesides skiing, you can spend some time shopping, chilling and eating at one of the many food court restaurants.\nSki Dubai; the indoor ski resort inside Mall of the Emirates, Dubai\nAfternoon \u2013 Barasti Beach\nOnce you\u2019ve made the most of your shopping spree, it\u2019s time to head to Barasti Beach! Located between Dubai Marina and The Palm, Barasti Beach is one of the most iconic beach bars in Dubai.\nMy personal favourite thing about it is that entry and use of the sun beds and umbrellas is free (unlike most beach bars in Dubai which charge 30+ EUR for the day).\nThey will check your bag on arrival as you\u2019re not allowed to bring any food or drinks inside.\nChilling at Barasti Beach in Dubai\nYou don\u2019t have to pay for sun beds, but if you plan on spending a whole afternoon or day there, they count on you probably spending something on food and drinks.\nThese can be a bit pricey, but when compared to average prices in Dubai, are actually pretty reasonable.\nBarasti Beach has a really cool vibe, with hammocks hanging just over the water, a pool, a stage for live music and a wide array of food and drink choices.\nPlus, it\u2019s lined by the iconic view of Dubai Marina skyscrapers behind it.\nEnjoying a drink at Barasti Beach Club in Dubai\nSunset \u2013 The view at The Palm at sunset\nOnce you\u2019ve had your fill of sea and sunshine, head over to Palm Jumeirah for one of the best sunset views you\u2019ll have ever seen.\nThat might seem hard to top after Burj Khalifa yesterday, but in my opinion, The View at The Palm is more fascinating.\nPalm Jumeirah is a palm-shaped artificial group of islands built just off the coast of Dubai.\nIt\u2019s one of the most incredible engineering feats you will ever see, and it\u2019s unique in its kind. You hear a lot of talk about The Palm, but rarely have a chance to see it properly.\nView over the Dubai Marina & JBR skyline from The View at The Palm\nThe sunset from The View at The Palm in Dubai\nThe View at The Palm\nis located on the 52nd floor above The Palm, and offers 360 views over, you\u2019ve guessed it, The Palm, as well as the Dubai Marina skyline, Burj Al Arab and even Burj Khalifa in the distance.\nEntrance ranges from 100-160 AED depending on if its prime hours or not. I recommend visiting at sunset, even though the price tag is higher as its at prime hours, it will honestly be worth the extra money.\nWatching the sun sink towards the ocean, pain the sky orange and turn golden as The Palm and Dubai skyline light up, was honestly one of the highlights of all my Dubai trips.\nIt doesn\u2019t get as busy as Burj Khalifa, so you don\u2019t need to arrive too much earlier than your ticket entrance.\nClick here to purchase your entry ticket to The View at The Palm!\nOr check out prices & availability below!\nEnjoying the sunset from The View at The Palm in Dubai\nEvening \u2013 Dinner at The Pointe\nSince you\u2019re already at The Palm, once the sun goes down you can just head over to The Pointe, a new iconic waterfront destination with views of the famous Atlantis Hotel, lined with shops, bars and restaurants.\nHere you can walk the Palm Jumeirah Fountain Show, while eating at one of the many waterfront restaurants. It\u2019s a slightly off the beaten track, with less tourists compared to other malls or beach areas in Dubai.\nThe Palm Fountain show as seen from The Pointe, with the famous Atlantis behind it\nDubai itinerary 4 days\nAs I already mentioned, three days is the bare minimum amount of time you need to spend in Dubai to enjoy it and see the sights.\nNow that you\u2019ve seen the main sights, you can go beyond, and spend your fourth day in Dubai doing something unique.\nDesert safari\nWith all the beaches, malls, glitz and glam of Dubai, you might have forgotten that you\u2019re actually in the middle of the desert.\nI didn\u2019t actually make it out to the desert until my third or fourth trip to Dubai, and I wish I\u2019d made it sooner.\nEnjoying a camel ride in Dubai desert\nOne of our cars got stuck in the Dubai desert while dune bashing\nOn a desert safari you can go beyond the souks and historical neighbourhoods of Dubai, and get a feel for what bedouin desert life was truly like.\nThere are loads of\ndesert safaris in Dubai\n, mostly offering similar things, but also with unique twists or special selling points.\nPretty much all safaris will include pick-up, drop-off,\ndune bashing\n,\nsand boarding\n, and a meal in the desert.\nDepending on whether you join a morning or afternoon tour, the meal will usually be a breakfast, lunch or dinner. I recommend joining an afternoon tour, since sunsets in the desert are absolutely magical!\nBeautiful sunset views in Dubai desert\nSpending a day away from the skyscrapers and beach clubs of Dubai is, in my opinion, a must on any Dubai itinerary. It gives you the opportunity to experience something truly unique, which you can\u2019t do just anywhere.\nBetween the adrenaline pumping dune bashing, the endless golden dunes, the magical golden sunset and the distinctive local culture, you\u2019re guaranteed to spend a truly thrilling day.\nDubai Red Dunes Safari, Camel Ride, BBQ & Al Marmoom Oasis\n\u2013 The most popular and complete desert safari out there, it includes all the fun desert activities, transfers and a BBQ dinner feast.\nFrom Dubai: Red Dunes and Camel Safari with Overnight Camp\n\u2013 Want to do something truly unique and spend a night in the desert? This is your opportunity to do so!\nThe pool at Bedouin Oasis Camp \u2013 the camp for our Dubai desert safari\nThe evening show during our desert safari\nDubai itinerary 5 days\nMorning \u2013 Extend your desert safari\nIf you have five days in Dubai, I highly recommend extending your desert safari and spending one night in the desert. If visiting the desert by day is magical, seeing it under the stars is even more so.\nSleeping in a bedouin tent (or fancy desert resort, that\u2019s up to you) is a once in a lifetime experience.\nThe overnight desert safaris will include both breakfast and dinner, and you can expect a traditional performance during dinner.\nAfter your magical night in the desert, you\u2019ll wake up feeling refreshed and energised. You can spend some time in the morning relaxing at your bedouin camp, and then get ready to head back to the city.\nGoing on a camel ride in the desert in Dubai\nAfternoon \u2013 Chill at the Beach & see the Burj Al Arab\nOnce you return to the city from your desert adventure, you can head back to the sea, and discover some new Dubai beaches you haven\u2019t yet visited.\nFor example Kite Beach; a long stretch of fine white sand and turquoise water.\nThis beach can get quite windy, which makes it perfect for kitesurfing and other water sports, hence the name. It\u2019s a fun beach to spend an afternoon, go for a dip, and maybe even try some kitesurfing!\nNearby you\u2019ll also see the famous Burj Al Arab, the iconic sail-shaped luxury hotel in Dubai.\nBurj Al Arab and the iconic Dubai skyline as seen from The View at The Palm\nYou can pop over to Public Beach (it doesn\u2019t seem to have a name, that\u2019s how it comes up on Google Maps) if you want to get a closer look.\nJust bear in mind that, as of April 2024, there was a construction site by the beach, which blocked the view of Burj Al Arab.\nI don\u2019t know at what stage the construction is now, or if it will be blocking the Burj Al Arab view permanently once completed.\nIf you want to continue your local Emirati experience, you can head over to Bu Qtair Restaurant for dinner (located half way between Kite Beach & the Burj Al Arab).\nIt\u2019s a very local and traditional fish restaurant, it\u2019s not fancy, but the fish is delicious!\nThe iconic sail shape of Burj al Arab in Dubai\nDubai itinerary 6 days\nIf you can spend at least six days in Dubai, then for your final day I recommend actually getting out of Dubai, and exploring the Emirati capital; Abu Dhabi.\nMany travellers don\u2019t know whether to choose\nDubai or Abu Dhabi\nfor their trips, but if you can spend at least six days in Dubai, you won\u2019t have to! Just follow this Dubai itinerary and you\u2019ll be able to see both.\nDay trip to Abu Dhabi\nAbu Dhabi is only a 1-hour drive away from Dubai, meaning you can easily do a\nday trip to Abu Dhabi from Dubai\n.\nOne day isn\u2019t a lot, but it\u2019s enough to see all the main sights of Abu Dhabi, and get a feel for this unique city.\nMany travellers often wonder if they should visit Dubai or Abu Dhabi, and while the answer ultimately depends on your travel style and mood, I definitely think Dubai has more going for it, and you can just visit Abu Dhabi for a day or two.\nExploring Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi\nYou can easily visit Abu Dhabi independently, just rent a car or hop on a bus and head over!\nAlternatively, if you don\u2019t feel like driving in the UAE or figuring out public transport, there are many organised day tours you can join. I have listed the best ones below.\nFrom Dubai: Abu Dhabi Premium Full-Day Sightseeing Tour\n\u2013 The most complete Dubai to Abu Dhabi day trip, it includes all of the major sights, transfer and lunch.\nFrom Dubai: Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed Mosque Guided Tour\n\u2013 A shorter tour for those who only want to visit Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque.\nFrom Dubai: Abu Dhabi Full-Day Trip with Grand Mosque & Louvre\n\u2013 For the arts and culture lovers, this tour focuses on the Grand Mosque and Louvre Museum.\nThe \u201cPower of Words\u201d piece inside Qasr Al-Watan in Abu Dhabi\nIf you do choose to visit Abu Dhabi independently, I have outlined below the must-see sights that you can\u2019t miss.\nEmirates Heritage Club\nEmirates Heritage Club is a reconstruction of a traditional desert village. It\u2019s a cool place to wander around, but after the souks and historical areas of Dubai and the desert experience, it probably won\u2019t wow you.\nWhat is wow about Emirates Heritage Club is the view of the Abu Dhabi skyline. You\u2019ll be right across from Corniche Beach, and will be able to enjoy the views of this unique skyline.\nEnjoying the view over the Abu Dhabi Skyline\nQasr al Watan\nThe Presidential Palace was completed in 2017, but only opened to the public in 2019.\nEntrance is 60 AED, and trust me when I saw, it\u2019s well worth the price tag. Qasr al Watan is one of the most stunning buildings I\u2019ve ever seen.\nThe white granite facade only hints at the sumptuous interior, where you will find absolutely breath taking rooms and decorations. Walking through its halls, you understand what real grandeur is.\nThe exterior of Qasr Al-Watan in Abu Dhabi\nThe grand interior of Qasr Al-Watan in Abu Dhabi\nSheikh Zayed Grand Mosque\nCompleted in 2007, Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque (often referred to as just Grand Mosque) is one of the largest mosques in the world, and home to the largest hand-woven carpet in the world.\nIt\u2019s an elaborate display of Islamic architecture and design.\u00a0With its domes, columns, details and spires, this imposing white building will leave you breathless.\nEntrance if free, just make sure to register online for a specific time slot, and make sure to dress appropriately or you won\u2019t be allowed in.\nSheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi\nSunset from What AlKarama\nWhat AlKarama is a war memorial just across the road from the Grand Mosque.\nIn and of itself it might not be a Abu Dhabi highlight, but what makes it special is the shallow pool in front of it, where you can see a perfect reflection of the Grand Mosque.\nIt\u2019s especially stunning at sunset, when the mosque starts to light, the sky turns pink and the reflection is perfectly defined.\nEnjoying the view over Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque at sunset\nIn my opinion, these are the four places you absolutely have to visit in Abu Dhabi.\nThere are many other famous and popular sights, such as\nFerrari World\n,\nThe Louvre\n, Saadiyat Island and Emirates Palace, but seeing all of them in one day would be a bit of a stretch.\nAfter all, this is a Dubai itinerary, not an Abu Dhabi one. If you can extend your Dubai trip and spend a night in Abu Dhabi that would be a great opportunity to see more of this unique city.\nIt also allows you to see the Abu Dhabi skyline lit for the night, which is quite the sight.\nIf you just want to get a feel for the Abu Dhabi vibe, a day trip is more than enough, and you can head back to Dubai for the last day of your Dubai itinerary.\nThe unique skyline of Abu Dhabi\nSheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi lit up for the night\nDubai itinerary 7 days\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to spend seven days in Dubai, here is the final day of your Dubai 1-week itinerary! To be entirely honest, I don\u2019t have specific recommendations for this final day in Dubai.\nIf you follow all my suggestions for the previous six days, by this point you\u2019ll have seen all the key highlights of Dubai and its surroundings.\nAnd let\u2019s be real, you\u2019ll probably also be a bit tired from all the sightseeing and travelling around.\nThe \u201cfronds\u201d of the Palm at sunset, as seen from The View at The Palm\nThe reason I suggest spending at least one week in Dubai, is because it gives you time to absorb everything you\u2019re seeing, without rushing too much.\nYou could see everything in less (as I said already, three days in Dubai are the bare minimum to see it all) but you\u2019ll be knackered by the end of it.\nOn this final day in Dubai you can head back to spots you particularly liked, maybe go back to Barasti Beach Club for some beach chilling, or head over to Dubai Mall for some final shopping.\nThere are also plenty of other attractions in Dubai that I haven\u2019t mentioned yet.\nLike the\nfamous water parks at Atlantis\nor Burj Al Arab, the pool club at The View at the Palm, seeing the sunset from Dubai Creek, the\nMuseum of the Future\n, or exploring the new Blueswater water front.\nI haven\u2019t included them in my core Dubai travel itinerary because, even though they\u2019re all great, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a core part of a Dubai trip.\nDepending on your personal interests, you can choose to visit one or more of them on this final day.\nThe Museum of the Future in Dubai\nFinal thoughts on the best Dubai holiday itinerary\nThere you have it, the ultimate Dubai itinerary! Have you been to Dubai before? How did you find it? Let me know in the comments below!\nI know Dubai isn\u2019t for everyone, but there\u2019s no denying it\u2019s a unique place and there\u2019s nowhere else quite like it. I truly believe everyone should visit Dubai at least once in their life, and experience what all the buzz is about.\nWith its huge malls, tall skyscrapers, glam lifestyle, fascinating desert and stunning sunsets, I know you\u2019ll love these Dubai itineraries.\nAs I already mentioned, you need seven days in Dubai to see everything, but if that\u2019s too long for you, then three days in Dubai is the bare minimum.\nIn this article I outlined day-by-day everything you should do and see in Dubai, building a Dubai itinerary for three days, four days, five days, six days and even seven days.\nRegardless of how long you have, one of these itineraries will fit your trip.\nI tried to include everything you need to know about planning your perfect Dubai itinerary, including the best activities, how to get around, where to stay, what to pack and more.

Luckily, getting around is super easy, thanks to its well-developed public transport network spread throughout all parts of the city.\nThe metro is the most commonly used public transport in the city. It connects most neighborhoods and it\u2019s just two lines, so it\u2019s really easy to navigate and it\u2019s also the most cost-effective way to get around. They are clean, ultra-modern, and safe. Women can choose to use the women-only carts if they want to. Plus, it connect you all the way to Dubai International Airport.\nAnother way to get around the city is by taxi. Uber and Careem are the common taxi service apps in Dubai. They are more expensive than a licensed taxi usually, but they offer a flat rate, which means if you get stuck in traffic you\u2019re not paying for it. As a rule of thumb, Careem is less expensive than Uber if you\u2019re travelling shorter distances and Uber is less expensive than Careem for longer distances.\nFinally, another way to get around Dubai is by taking the bus. There are a total of 1,518 buses in Dubai, running on 119 internal lines, including 35 lines connected to the metro stations. Buses are a cheap way of getting around, but they require a bit of searching to make sure you\u2019re on the right bus. As Dubai is so hot and it\u2019s no fun waiting around in the scorching heat for a bus, I recommend you get the metro and Ubers. Plus they are so cheap it makes perfect sense!\nTravel with peace of mind. Travel WITH a security belt.\nStash your cash safely with this money belt.

Although Dubai is considered to be\none of the safest cities\nin the United Arab Emirates. It is also known as one of the safest middle eastern destinations for women and travelers in general. However, it is still wise to take precautions and\nknow the country you\u2019re visiting\nwhile traveling abroad.\nIt is recommended that travelers who visit Dubai, especially women, dress fairly modestly in public, and bathing suits are only allowed on the beach and at hotel pools. While women are generally safe in Dubai, It is also a good idea to avoid situations that can place you in a more vulnerable position. If traveling alone, ask to be seated in the family section and try to sit in the women\u2019s section at the front of the train.\nThere can also be unpredictable driving behavior in the United Arab Emirates, so keep an eye out for reckless driving. Pickpocketing is fairly rare in Dubai, but pay attention to your surroundings (as is always wise when traveling), especially around the tourist hub, Jumeirah Beach.\nWhile Dubai is fairly cosmopolitan in many ways, they remain highly conservative, so try to avoid PDA because if someone is offended by it, you can get charged/fined. It is also forbidden to eat in public during the daylight hours of Ramadan, however, most hotels provide a screen in their restaurants so foreign guests can eat during the day.\nDubai is considered to be friendly and safe for the most part, but make sure you check out all the rules and tips for traveling there before you go. As you are likely traveling in a foreign country, ensure you have access to emergency numbers in case of an accident or problem. It\u2019s also always a good idea to have travel insurance in the event of a problem.\nALWAYS sort out your backpacker insurance before your trip. There\u2019s plenty to choose from in that department, but a good place to start is\nSafety Wing\n.\nThey offer month-to-month payments, no lock-in contracts, and require absolutely no itineraries: that\u2019s\nthe exact kind of insurance long-term travellers and digital nomads need.\nSafetyWing is cheap, easy, and admin-free: just sign up lickety-split so you can get back to it!\nClick the button below to learn more about SafetyWing\u2019s setup or read our insider review for the full tasty scoop.\nVisit SafetyWing\nOr Read Our Review!\nIt\u2019s good to get lost sometimes, but it\u2019s also good not to get\ntoo\nlost.

It\u2019s a free activity in Dubai. You don\u2019t need tickets to see this fountain show. It\u2019s just right outside the Dubai Mall.\nDUBAI FOUNTAIN SHOW TIMINGS\nDuring the day there are only two fountain shows. From Saturday to Thursday it\u2019s held at 1 pm and 1.30 pm. And on Friday it\u2019s held at 1.30 pm and 2 pm.\nThe first one is around 5 minutes with super awesome Arabic music and the second one is really short; about 3 minutes, and it\u2019s played with classical music.\nThen, in the evening the fountain show is played every half an hour from 6 pm to 11 pm.\nWHERE TO WATCH THE DUBAI FOUNTAIN SHOW\nYou can watch the fountain show from the Apple Store free, from next to the lake where the fountain show is or from any of the restaurants around the lake.\nYou cannot miss one of the restaurants around the lake from which you can watch the water dance.\nI tried\nLogma\nwhich serves among other traditional Emirates dishes.

It\u2019s in front of the restaurant called\nCheese Cake Factory\n.\u00a0 Btw, It\u2019s a super popular restaurant.\nNevertheless, don\u2019t miss the\nAquarium and Underwater Zoo\n. Walking through its 48-meter-long underwater tunnel is an absolutely magical experience.\nbook your Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo Day Ticket!\nIf you are an adventure lover, try cage snorkeling as well! Because why not try something crazy as diving with sharks and shark walkers. It will be the adventure of your life!\n4) VISIT THE MIDDLE EAST\u2019S LARGEST CANDY STORE\nBy the way, next to the\nCheese Cake Factory\nthere is a candy shop I really love. It\u2019s the\nCandylicious\n.\nYou can also see how they make their beautiful and colorful candies there. I felt like a little kiddo there. My favorites were the Hello Kitty candies.\n5) EXPLORE SOUK AL BAHAR\nSouk al Bahar, the sailor\u2019s market\u201d, is a traditional Arabic-style retail and dining location.\nThe architecture of this part of the Dubai Mall featuring beautiful natural stone corridors, tall archways, and Arabian d\u00e9cor is absolutely fabulous.\nIn this marketplace, you will find some places where you can dress up in traditional Emirati attire and take photos.\nIt costs 100 AED (~27 USD).\nDubai Mall \u2013 One of the places to visit in Dubai in 7 days \u2013 Dubai Itinerary\nThe Majestic and glamourous al Bahar Souk in Dubai Mall \u2013 Dubai 7 day itinerary\n6) SHOP UNTIL YOU DROP\u00a0 AT DUBAI MALL\nShopping in Dubai Mall is definitely a lot of fun. You\u2019ll find here so many brands from Adidas to Dior. If you are not into shopping that much, at least check their awesome souvenir shops.\nMy favorite part was Fashion Avenue. I find it the most beautiful part where you can find stylish caf\u00e9s and super expensive retail shops. The design of this part is simply gorgeous, so don\u2019t miss it.\nGifts from Dubai \u2013 Dubai 7 day itinerary\n7) EAT FOOD FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD\nI tried Indian, Chinese, Japanese food, bubble tea, and who knows what in the Dubai Mall. I loved everything! Food in Dubai is just next level. It\u2019s literally impossible to find food you will not like.\nAverage a proper meal cost around 40 AED (11 USD) but I had all kinds of snacks around 25 AED. Just embrace all the delicacies from different cultures and surely you won\u2019t regret it. I can\u2019t wait to go back to Dubai and eat my way out again in the Dubai Mall.\nDAY 2\u00a0 of the 7-DAY DUBAI ITINERARY\nDubai Marina Area: Dubai Marina, Jumeirah Beach Residence, Bluewaters Residences Island\nThe Dubai Marina area is an artificial canal city. Mostly western ex-pats live here.\nHOW TO GET TO DUBAI MARINA\nMetro:\nDAMAC Properties Metro station\n5 BEST THINGS TO DO IN DUBAI MARINA\n1)\u00a0 STROLL ALONG DUBAI MARINA WALK\nDubai Marina Walk is an awesome 7 km (4.3 mi) waterfront walkway along the canal in the Dubai Marina Area.\u00a0 As you walk along, you have a beautiful view over the canal with luxury yachts and luxury hotels.\nAlso, it\u2019s an excellent place for trying international cafes, food outlets and restaurants.\nA main course costs starts around 60 AED (~ 16 USD) in a restaurant. The street food is also very delicious along the promenade. You can grab a piece of shawarma for 25 AED (~ 7 USD).\nDubai Marina \u2013 one of the best places to visit in Dubai in 7 days\n2) SEE DUBAI\u2019S HIGHLIGHTS ON A SPEEDBOAT TOUR\nThat was one of the most amazing things I did in Dubai. I took my speed boat tour at 1 pm. It was a good decision because it was super sunny at that time.\nAtlantis, The Palm from the speedboat\nBurj Al Arab from the speedboat\nThis is really the best way to see some of the major landmarks of Dubai such as the Dubai Marina, Dubai Eye, Atlantis The Palm Hotel, and the Burj Al Arab.\nBy all means, book the 99-minute boat tour as that\u2019s the only one taking you to the Burj Khalifa as well. I tried an hour-long wooden boat tour as well but it\u2019s not that wauuu as I thought.\nSo, after trying different boat tours, I can tell you that the speed boat is the most exciting one and the best for nice photos as well.\nI also highly recommend that you book with the same company I linked here because I can tell you that they are really awesome. They have nice and funny English-speaking guides. And most importantly they take awesome pictures. You\u2019ll have so much fun with them. :-)\nCheck rates & book your speed boat tour!\n3) GO ON AN UNFORGETTABLE BREAKFAST CRUISE\nIf you like it more relaxed, then\ntake a luxury yacht tour with breakfast or barbecue\n.

It\u2019s full of people and restaurants. If you are a beach person, just stay there for a while. Then, I can recommend you to walk around in the shopping and dining area of the beach, and have dinner in one of the restaurants next to the beach to feel the vibe of the place.\nJumeirah Beach \u2013 one of the best places to visit in Dubai in 7 days\nHow to get to the JBR from Dubai Marina\nAfter the boat tour, take a water taxi to the Marine Promenade which is around a 30-minute journey.

Even if you have a car, better to go there by metro because it\u2019s pretty hard to park there.\n10 BEST THINGS TO DO IN OLD DUBAI\n1) TRY AN INDIAN RESTAURANT\nWhen you get to old Dubai, you can find a myriad of inexpensive places to eat. For example, I had Indian Chicken Biryani for 13 AED (~4 USD) with Karak (milk tea) for 2 AED close to the metro station.\nAlternatively, you can have lunch in an Indian restaurant called Bikanervala in the heritage village.\nI paid 30 AED (~ 8 USD) for a meal and 7 AED (~ 2 USD) for a Karak (milk tea). As it\u2019s a touristy area, the prices are higher.\nAll of them very very tasty.\n2) VISIT THE DUBAI MUSEUM\nFrom the station walk to the Dubai Museum. The entry fee is 3 AED (~0.80 USD)\nThe Dubai Museum is the primary museum of Dubai.

It lasts for 90 minutes. You need to book well in advance as this event is super popular.\nIn Dubai, you find a lot of international restaurants but not so many places where you can try traditional Emirati dishes. But here you can taste a variety of local Emirati dishes and learn about the customs and traditions of the UAE.\nClick on the options below to see the details:\nBreakfast at Sheikh Mohammed\nLunch at Sheikh Mohammed Cultural Center\n5) LEARN ABOUT COFFEE CULTURE IN THE COFFEE MUSEUM\nBefore or after the cultural center, try coffee in the Coffee Museum where the entrance is 10 AED (~3 USD).

Here, traditional Emirati main courses cost between 60 and 70 AED (~16 \u2013 19 USD).\nI paid 60 dirhams (~16 USD) for a Chicken Deyay and 25 dirhams (~7 USD) for a hibiscus tea. I can highly recommend both of them.\nIt\u2019s not only you getting hungry :-) \u2013 Dubai Itinerary\n7) SHOP AT THE DUBAI OLD SOUK\nIt\u2019s a typical Arabian street market but mostly with Indian sellers. It\u2019s a great place to take pictures and buy souvenirs.\nI actually went to a shop close to the station which looked like a Euro Shop and bought souvenirs there. I bought the same shiny camel for 10 AED that they offered for about 40 AED.\nWhat I really enjoyed in the old souk was Indian street food and Karak (milky tea). I asked Pakora for 5 AED and Karak. The Karak on the street costs only 1 AED. No need to ask for the price of the Karak, just pay 1 dirham.\nAs for the Pakora, just ask for it for 5 AED. If you ask the price, you will pay more. This Pakora is actually so filling that it\u2019s enough for lunch.\nThings to buy in Dubai \u2013 Shopping in old souk is one of the best things to do in Dubai\nSpices in old souk in Bur Dubai\n8)\u00a0 TAKE A BOAT RIDE AT THE DUBAI CREEK\nDubai Creek has been serving as a fishing area, a pearling site and a gateway for trades for centuries.

I\u2019ve done that a few times just for fun. :-) Each boat is for 20 passengers and it costs only 1 AED. If you are willing to pay more you can do it privately.\nAbra boats in Bur Dubai\nTrying the old wooden boats called abra at the Dubai Creek is must do in Dubai\n9) GET LOST IN GRAND SOUK DEIRA\nIt\u2019s a traditional Arabian marketplace labyrinth of mostly covered alleyways. It\u2019s also called the Al Souk Al-Kabeer.\nThis is where you can buy a lot of exotic spices, herbs, coffee, and dried fruits such as dates. Make sure you buy dates here.\nAsk for premium dates which are called Medjool dates in Arabic. Medjool dates are dates of the highest quality. I got big juicy Saudi Arabian dates which I can highly recommend. I bought a lot for my family as a gift and they loved it.\nRedgold saffron in Deira, Dubai\n10) BUY GOLD AT THE DEIRA GOLD SOUK\nThis is a very famous part of the grand market.

It\u2019s possible to move around by local buses in Abu Dhabi but if you have only one day it\u2019s not worth it. It takes too much time to buy bus tickets and the buses rarely run and they are too slow. Taxi is really cheap in Abu Dhabi anyways.\nHOW TO TRAVEL TO ABU DHABI FROM DUBAI INDEPENDENTLY\nCheapest way to get to Abu Dhabi:\nBy bus. From the Ibn Battuta Station to Abu Dhabi Central Station. The buses start at 5 am and they run until midnight every 15 minutes.\nYou can use your NOL card for this ride.\nOne way: 25 AED (~7 USD), ~116 km / 72 mi, 1 h 40 min\nFastest way to get to Abu Dhabi:\nBy taxi\nDubai to Abu Dhabi taxi fare:\u00a0~200 AED (~54 USD) \u2013 250 AED (~68 USD), ~1 h 10 mins\nBEST CITY TOUR FROM DUBAI TO ABU DHABI\nThe best way to visit Abu Dhabi is by joining a tour.\nLet me show you the best tour from Dubai to Abu Dhabi:\nAbu Dhabi full-day sightseeing tour from Dubai\nI recommend this tour because it covers the most tourist attractions in Abu Dhabi.\nIt\u2019s an 8 to 9-hour tour including the best things to see in Abu Dhabi: Sheikh Zayed Mosque, The Corniche, in Abu Dhabi, Emirates Palace, Qasr Al Watan and Marina Mall.\nsecure your spot for the best abu dhabi day trip from dubai!\n5 BEST PLACES TO VISIT IN ABU DHABI\nThese are the best places that you can see in one day in Abu Dhabi.\n1) SHEIKH ZAYED GRAND MOSQUE\nEstablishing this grandiose mosque was one of the amazing projects of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who was the former Ruler of Abu Dhabi for 30 years and the first president of the UAE.\nHis intention was to build a structure that unites the cultural diversity of the Islamic world and where modern and historical art meet.\nThe entrance is free.\nIn the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, you need to cover up.\nWomen must wear headscarf and abaya inside the mosque. You will get one free of charge at the entrance. I bought a nice black abaya with golden embroidery in one of the souvenir shops in the mosque. It cost 150 AED (~37\u20ac / ~ 41USD)).\nMen need to wear long trousers and full sleeve shirt.\nIn the Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi, UAE \u2013 Dubai Itinerary\n2) QASHR AL WATAN, THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE\nIn the past, the Presidential Palace was only used for official purposes, such as hosting foreign leaders of states and for highly important presidential meetings. Even after being opened to the public, the palace continues to be used for these purposes.\nAs of today, it\u2019s open to the public as well. Sheikhs Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the current Ruler of Abu Dhabi and President of the United Arab Emirates, and Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces decided to show this beautiful palace to the world.\nThe entrance fee for adults is 65 AED (~17.70 USD) and 30 AED for children.\nInside the Presidential Palace in Abu Dhabi, UAE \u2013 Dubai Itinerary\n3) EMIRATES PALACE\nIt\u2019s a luxury 5-star hotel with stunning Arabian interiors that you must see. When you are there, you will feel like you were dropped in the most beautiful fairy tale ever.\nEven if you are not a guest, you can visit the hotel. There is no admission fee.\nCHECK OUT THE BEAUTIFUL EMIRATES PALACE HERE!\n4) ETIHAD TOWERS\nIt\u2019s a mind-blowing complex of buildings with five towers. They have a really amazing design. If you are in Abu Dhabi only for one day, you\u2019ll not have time to go there but you can see them from the court of the presidential palace.\n5) THE CORNICHE, ABU DHABI\nThe Corniche is an 8 km long seaside promenade including a 5,5 km beach, the Corniche Public Beach. If you start walking from the most northern part of the corniche, the Mina Dhow Harbor, in about two hours, you will end up at the Presidential Palace and the Emirates Palace Hotel.\nWhen you are there, you can have a nice meal in one of the amazing restaurants on the beach or in the Marina Mall.\nCheck out my travel guide for more information about Abu Dhabi!\nBest Day Trips from Dubai to Abu Dhabi + Travel Tips\nDAY 6 of the 7-DAY DUBAI ITINERARY\nPalm Jumeirah, Atlantis the Palm, Waterpark, The Pointe\nHOW TO GET TO ATLANTIS THE PALM\nYou can get to the\nAtlantis the Palm\n, either by monorail or by taxi. The monorail is much better because the view is so much nicer than from a taxi.\nHOW TO GET TO THE MONORAIL (Palm Jumeirah Monorail Footbridge)\nFastest way:\nBy taxi. Take the tram to the Internet City and then from there take a taxi.\nCheapest way:\nTake the metro to the Damac Properties (Dubai Marina) and then change for the tram to Palm Jumeirah, and then take the walk to the Palm Gateway. You will have to walk through a parking lot to find the monorail.\nMonorail ticket:\nYou can only buy your ticket on the spot. A single ticket costs 20 AED (~5 USD) and a return ticket costs 30 AED (~8 USD). You can also use the\nNOL card\nto pay for your ticket.\nPalm Jumeirah Monorail \u2013 Dubai 7 day itinerary\n6 BEST THINGS TO DO IN ATLANTIS DUBAI & AROUND IT\n1) MARVEL AT PALM JUMEIRAH FROM THE SKY\nPalm Jumeirah is the\nlargest artificial island in the world\n.\u00a0 It\u2019s an incredibly fascinating archipelago shaped like a palm tree.\u00a0 It\u2019s home to luxury hotels and resorts such as the famous Atlantis, The Palm, beautiful apartment buildings and beachfront villas.\nIf you want to get the best view over this island, you need to fly. The most exciting way to get an epic view over the Palm is from a helicopter.\ncheck & book a dubai city heli tour!\nThe world\u2019s largest artificial island, Palm Jumeirah, in Dubai, UAE\n2) LOOK AROUND ATLANTIS THE PALM\nWhen you get to the\nAtlantis the Palm\n, you can walk along the coast and in the public area of the Atlantis Hotel.\nIn the public area, you can find a bunch of awesome places of entertainment. In one day, you\u2019ll not have time for all these fantastic activities. Thus, you\u2019ll need to pick the ones you like the most.\nAtlantis The Palm Hotel also must be on any Dubai itinerary\n3) DISCOVER THE LOST CHAMBERS OF ATLANTIS\nIn the\nLost Chambers\nyou will find a water lagoon with 65,000 marine animals including sharks, eels and sea horses.\n4) HAVE FUN AT THE AQUAVENTURE WATERPARK\nThe Atlantis Aquapark\nis the number 1 Waterpark in the Middle East. It\u2019s full of crazy adrenalin-pumping rides.\n5) SWIM WITH DOLPHINS IN THE DOLPHIN BAY\nHow about making new friends with dolphins? Yes, Dubai is all about unforgettable experiences. You can\nmeet cute dolphins and spend 30 minutes with them in Dubai\u2019s Aquaventure Waterpark at Atlantis\n.\nThis way you can get free access to the Aquaventure Waterpark. This one is actually only in shallow water but there is another activity where\nyou can swim with a dolphin in 3-meter deep water\n.\n6) ENJOY THE POINTE BEACH\nOn the way back, take a taxi or the monorail to The Pointe Beach which was my favorite public beach.\nFrom there you also have an amazing view of Atlantis. Especially, in the evening, it\u2019s an awesome place to have a dinner with a wonderful view over the illuminated Atlantis the Palm and the monorail.\n7) MARVEL AT THE PALM FOUNTAIN SHOW\nIt\u2019s similar to the Dubai Fountain Show but it\u2019s more colorful and there is no crowd there. I personally like this much more.\nPalm Fountain\u2019s show timings: On weekdays, the first show starts at 6 pm and the last show starts at 10:30 pm. On weekends, luckily the last show starts at midnight.\nChilling on a bean bag with a view Atlantis, The Palm and the main rail track\nA spontanious sport car exhibition\nDAY 7 of the 7-DAY DUBAI ITINERARY\nJumeirah Mosque, Kite Beach, Burj Al Arab, Madinat Jumeirah\nStart the day with the\nJumeirah Mosque\n. From the mosque, you can take a taxi to Kite Beach. There are buses as well. But save time by taking a taxi. By bus, it would take too much time.\nFrom the\nKite Beach\n, you can walk to\nJumeira Public Beach\n. It would take you around 30 \u2013 40 minutes. To be honest, I don\u2019t find these public beaches impressive at all.\nFrom this Kite Beach, you can go to the\nBurj Al Arab\nand take photos with it at the gate. It\u2019s very popular among tourists.\nIf you really want to go to beautiful beach, I recommend skipping the Kite Beach and the Jumeira Public Beach, and go to the Ocean Beach.\nOcean Beach\nis a private beach that belongs to the Jumeirah al Naseem Hotel. It\u2019s also known as the Madinat Jumeirah private beach but on Google Maps, you will find it as Ocean Beach. If you are not a guest, the day pass to use the beach costs 450 dinars (~123 USD).\nFrom this beach, you will have the best view of the iconic Burj Al Arab.\nFrom the Burj Al Arab, you can walk to the\nMadinat Jumeirah\nwhere you will find an indoor bazaar and picturesque lake with cozy restaurants.\nThe entrance of Souk Madinat Jumeirah \u2013 7 day itinerary Dubai\nIt\u2019s a perfect place for a nice and quiet lunch or dinner. A meal at Madinat Jumeirah costs at least 150 AED (~37 \u20ac / ~41 USD). But in most restaurants, you would pay more here.\nMadinat Jumeirah \u2013 One of the best places to visit in Dubai in 7 days\n5. WHERE TO STAY IN DUBAI \u2013 BEST AREAS TO STAY IN DUBAI\nDubai has 6 main areas in terms of accommodation where you can find amazing hotels: Downtown Dubai, The Palm, Dubai Marina and Jumeirah Beach Residence, Bur Dubai, and Deira.\n1. DOWNTOWN DUBAI HOTELS\nStrategically, downtown Dubai is the\nbest area to stay\nin Dubai as it\u2019s situated between old Dubai (Deira) and The Palm. Downtown Dubai is about 12 km from old Dubai and 22 km from The Palm and JBR Beach.\nThere is a lot of different type of supermarkets, shops, and restaurants for all budgets.\nKEY TOURIST ATTRACTIONS IN DOWNTOWN DUBAI\nDubai Mall, Burj Khalifa, Dubai Fountain Show\nPhoto credit: via Booking.com\nLUXURY HOTEL \u2013\nPalace Downtown\nThis hotel is a dream.

HOTELS IN DUBAI MARINA AREA & JUMEIRAH BEACH RESIDENCE (JBR)\nIn these neighborhoods, mostly Western ex-pats live. So, it\u2019s kind of the most westernized part of Dubai.\nThey are the most walkable parts of modern Dubai. If you stay here, you are close to the beach, you can jog on the promenade, and find countless amazing, and fancy restaurants and bars.\nI found these areas much more expensive than Downtown Dubai. Both the restaurants and supermarkets are much more expensive than in Downtime Dubai.\nI stayed in this area twice: once in Dubai Marina and once in JBR.

ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY TIPS\nAs for my plan for my 7-day plan, day 7 contains must-see places in Dubai. But, to be honest, you can just replace the activities with any of the below-mentioned ones.\nMiracle Garden\nIt already sounds awesome! :-) It is needless to say that it\u2019s the largest flower garden in the world. Here we are talking about 50 million different flowers and 250 million different plants.\nEntrance fee for the Dubai Miracle Garden\n75 AED for adults (~20 USD)\n60 AED for children (3-12 y.) (~16 USD)\nBeach Clubs in Dubai\nBeach clubs are big in Dubai. Here I collected the 3 best beach clubs in Dubai\nZero Gravity\n: This is a super popular beach club close to the JBR from which you will have a wonderful view of the Dubai Marina.\nPrice for day passes\nSunday to Thursday: 160 AED (~44 USD)\nFriday Brunch AED 295 (~80 USD) for ladies, and AED 345 (~94 USD) for gents\nSaturday Brunch AED 249 (~68 USD) for ladies, and AED 299 (~81 USD) for gents\nOpening hours\n10:00 \u2013 21:00\nNasimi Beach\nThis is an absolute dream.

But I believe it can be awesome when you are with friends in Dubai.\nI made some research on clubbing as well. :-)\nYou can follow their accounts on Instagram and see whether you would like them.\nWhite Dubai\nCavalli Club\nAntika Bar\n7. BEST TIME TO VISIT DUBAI\nRegarding the best time to travel to Dubai, the most important thing to consider is the weather.\nThe temperature in different seasons is one of the most important things to know before traveling to Dubai. Other important factors could the prices and how crowded Dubai is in different seasons.\u00a0 But at the end of the day, they are all related to the weather.\nBEST SEASON TO VISIT DUBAI\nThe best season to go to Dubai is winter.\nThe most ideal time to travel to Dubai is anytime from November to April. This is the tourist season in Dubai when it\u2019s sunny and pleasantly warm but not too hot.\nIn winter, you can do everything in Dubai. The winter activities in Dubai are limitless.\nOf course, this is also when Dubai is pretty crowded and hotel rates skyrocket. Hotel prices are 3 or 5 times more than in summer.\nBEST MONTH TO VISIT DUBAI\nDecember \u2013 January \u2013 February: Dubai Peak Season\nIn terms of the temperatures, the best month to travel to Dubai is definitely one of the winter months: December, January or February. This is literally the peak season.\nAnd, obviously, the peak season means the highest hotel prices and the biggest crowds.\nChristmas is definitely a popular time to visit Dubai. I think it\u2019s an absolutely fantastic idea to spend the Christmas holidays in Dubai.\nThen, in January and February. It\u2019s the best time for shopping in Dubai as you can get terrific discounts on really amazing merchandises.\nIn these months, it gets darker earlier, already at 4 am. Therefore, I recommend starting the day early to see as much as possible in daylight. But you will also find a lot of amazing places and activities that are very beautiful and a lot of fun at night.\nNovember and March: Best Weather in Dubai\nThis is right before and after the peak season. The weather is consistently pleasant. At this time, the prices are a bit lower for hotels and there is less crowd in Dubai.\nI spent a couple of weeks in Dubai at the end of November and the beginning of December. I didn\u2019t feel it was crowded and the prices were pretty good. I think places such as\nMunich\nfeel more crowded literally all year long.\nI traveled to Dubai spontaneously from\nIran\nat the end of November and I didn\u2019t know what to expect. But it was an awesome decision. I told myself, hey girl, you just nailed the best time of the year to visit Dubai.\nCheck out the following comparison table I put together. It will surely help you to decide about when you should travel to Dubai.\nMonth in High Season\nAverage High Temperature\nAverage Low Temperature\nDubai Temperature November\n31 \u00b0C / 88 \u00b0F\n20 \u00b0C / 68 \u00b0F\nDubai Temperature December\n26 \u00b0C / 79 \u00b0F\n16 \u00b0C / 61 \u00b0F\nDubai Temperature January\n24 \u00b0C / 75 \u00b0F\n14 \u00b0C / 57 \u00b0F\nDubai Temperature February\n25 \u00b0C / 77 \u00b0F\n16 \u00b0C / 60 \u00b0F\nDubai Temperature March\n29 \u00b0C / 84 \u00b0F\n18 \u00b0C / 64 \u00b0F\nWORST TIME TO VISIT DUBAI\nThe worst time to travel to Dubai is summertime: June, July and August.\nSummer in Dubai is just freaking hot, it\u2019s a scorcher. Moreover, it can be extremely humid. Thus, the things to do in Dubai in summer are limited.\nFor most tourists, it will be probably too hot to enjoy their vacation in Dubai. However, this is the cheapest time to go to Dubai. This is when the hotel prices drop. The cheapest month to visit Dubai is probably July when the temperature can get as high as 41 \u00b0C / 106 \u00b0F.\nRAMADAN IN 2022\nRamadan, the holy month of Muslims, will be observed next time from April\u00a0 2 in 2022. If you are not a Muslim, you\u2019ll probably not enjoy Dubai this time.\nIt\u2019s because in the month of Ramadan you cannot eat, drink or smoke in public as these activities are banned during the day. Moreover, a lot of businesses will be closed during daylight\nMonths in Low Season\nAverage High Temperature\nAverage Low Temperature\nDubai Temperature April\n33 \u00b0C / 91 \u00b0F\n21 \u00b0C / 70 \u00b0F\nDubai Temperature May\n38 \u00b0C / 100 \u00b0F\n25 \u00b0C / 77 \u00b0F\nDubai Temperature June\n40 \u00b0C / 104 \u00b0F\n28 \u00b0C / 82 \u00b0F\nDubai Temperature July\n41 \u00b0C / 106 \u00b0F\n30 \u00b0C / 86 \u00b0F\nDubai Temperature August\n41 \u00b0C / 106 \u00b0F\n31 \u00b0C / 87 \u00b0F\nDubai Temperature September\n39 \u00b0C / 102 \u00b0F\n28\u00b0C / 82 \u00b0F\nDubai Temperature October\n35 \u00b0C / 95 \u00b0F\n24 \u00b0C / 75 \u00b0F\n8. COVID-19 TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS\nDubai is open to tourists.\nPeople traveling to Dubai are no longer required to present COVID-19 vaccination certificates or negative PCR test results\n.\n9. GETTING AROUND IN DUBAI\nBY CAR\nThe best way to get around in the UAE, in general, is by car. If you are on holiday in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, don\u2019t waste your time with public transport unless you want to drink alcohol. If you are at least 2 persons, it\u2019s worth it 100%. This way you\u2019ll save a lot of time.\nYou can check car rentals prices and book a car here on the website of\nAuto Europe\n. Prices start at 125 \u20ac (~ 140 USD) with full insurance.\nThe fuel prices are affordable as well. Here are some of the fuel prices projected in Dubai.\nSpecial 95: 212 AED (~ 0.51 \u20ac / 0.58 USD) / litre\nSuper 98: 2.24 AED (~ 0.55 \u20ac /0.60 USD) / litre\nParking is between 2 -4 AED per hour depending on where you park in the city. Public holidays and weekends have the same fare.\nDUBAI PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION\nDUBAI METRO\nRiding the Dubai Metro is an absolutely fabulous experience. It\u2019s one of the most fantastic metro lines in the world. The metro itself is super clean and modern and it runs without a driver.\nView from the Dubai Metro \u2013 Dubai 7 day itinerary\nDUBAI METRO CARD\nNOL CARD: Best choice for tourists\nIf you want to use public transport in Dubai, you must have a NOL CARD. It\u2019s basically a chip card that you can recharge.\nAbout the NOL CARD System:\nWhere can you use the NOL CARD?\nYou can use the Nol Card on the metros, buses, taxies and trams in Dubai. Moreover, you can use your Nol Card for museums, public park entry, parking and even paying for groceries.\nHow much is a Nol card in Dubai?\nMine, which was a colorful card, was 20 AED and included 15 AED credit. I think at that time it was some kind of special offer and I could use it for the metro, bus and water bus.\nThis is how to use the Dubai metro card \u2013 Dubai 7 day itinerary\nGetting in the Dubai Metro \u2013 Dubai 7 day itinerary\nDubai Metro Zones\nThis is very important to understand. Dubai has 7 zones. The rate you pay for traveling by metro and tram depends on from which zone to which zone you are traveling. There are 7 zones and 3 payment rates.\nTier 1 in zone 1: you travel only within one zone or less than 3 km crossing 2 zones\nTier 2 in zone 2: you start in one zone and finish in a neighboring zone\nTier 3 in zone 3-7: you travel in three or more zones\nWhere can you get a NOL card in Dubai?\nIn all Dubai Metro stations and at certain Dubai Bus stations\nFrom RTA Customer Service Centers and RTA authorized sales points\nFrom ticket vending machines\nDubai Metro Prices\nNol Red Ticketdub\nValidity:\nOnly on one type of public transport\nNol Red Ticket fares\ncosts 2 UAD\nminimum amount to recharge; 7.50 AED\n1 zone: 4 AED\n2 zones: 6 AED\n3+ zones: 8.50 AED\nNol Silver Ticket\nValidity:\nin regular class on the metro tram and water taxi\nNol Silver Ticket fares\ncost 25 AED including 19 AED credit (e-purse value)\nminimum amount to recharge; 7.50 AED\n1 zone: 3 AED\n2 zones: 5 AED (for example Burj Khalifa \u2013 Dubai Marina)\n3 zones: 7.50 AED (for example Dubai Airport \u2013 Burj Khalifa)\nNol Gold Ticket\nThis is the best Dubai metro card. If you have the Nol Card, you have access to the seats of Gold Class of the Dubai Metro. It\u2019s really worth it. In the morning and in the evening the metro in Dubai can be completely full which is not fun when you are a tourist in Dubai.\nValidity:\nin gold class on the metro and tram +\u00a0 on a regular water taxi\nNol Gold Ticket and fares\ncost 25 AED including 19 AED credit (e-purse value)\nminimum amount to recharge; 7.50 AED\n1 zone: 6 AED\n2 zones: 10 AED\n3 zones: 15 AED\nI had the silver card: I spent around 150 AED in two weeks and I was on the go every single day. I used the card for the metro, buses, and tram. When my parents visited Dubai, they bought the Gold Nol Card. They loved the Gold Class.\nDUBAI METRO TIMING\nThe metro is running every 3 minutes during the day and it\u2019s super fast. The metro is super efficient too.\nABOUT USING THE DUBAI METRO\nOne end of the metro is only for women and children. I always used that. This way you will have an awesome view of the metro rails and the building along the way.\nAs for the bus, I don\u2019t really recommend it. Instead, take a taxi. Taking the bus might save you money but you will loose a lot of time as I did when I tried the buses.\nThe other end of the metro is the gold class for gold card users. If I were a man, I would travel there so that I had a nice view from the metro. This is also why I recommended the Nol Gold Card to my parents.\nBetween the two ends, you have the mixed sections for regular cardholders. I tried only once and it was enough. It was so smelly.\nTo go to Abu Dhabi you can use the same card you use in Dubai.\nDUBAI TRAM\nIt\u2019s super nice as well. I absolutely loved traveling by tram in Dubai.\nMake sure you have a sweater with you when you use the metro and the bus. They use a lot of cold air conditioning and it can be too cold.\nDUBAI BUSES\nI don\u2019t recommend buses if you are on vacation in Dubai. Commuting by bus simply takes too much time. If the metro and the tram don\u2019t take you where you want to travel to, take a taxi.\nTAXI IN DUBAI\nTaxi is cheap in Dubai.\nYou can use taxi apps or get a taxi from the street.\nDubai Taxi Apps\nQuite often, it might be more convenient to use a taxi app such as Uber and Careem. But it always seemed to me that they charge you more than a taxi from the street.\nIn any case, in a lot of situations, booking a taxi using a taxi booking app is just so much more convenient.\nDubai Taxi Fare Examples\n5 km costs 16 AED (~4.40 USD)\n7 km costs 20 AED (~6 USD)\n50 km: 100 AED (~27 USD)\nThe taxi meter is in every taxi and it\u2019s compulsory to use it including airport taxis. Don\u2019t make deals with taxi drivers. If you try it, you will probably pay more than the official rates.\nYou can only pay with cash. As for taxi drivers, be careful. They are extremely nice and polite but they can be tricky.\nAlways follow the route on Google maps and know where you want to go. And do stop the driver if he drives you further than you need.\nOnce one driver said: \u201cOh, I missed the turn, sorry.\u201d So I ended up paying more because he had to drive too much until he could turn back.\nAnother time, when I clearly told the driver where I want to be dropped off, he drove two tram stops further, even though he could have dropped me where I wanted it. Once I noticed it, we had to drive a lot forward until we could turn back. Again, I ended up paying more than I should have.\nOnce in Abu Dhabi, I had only 100 AED and the driver told me that he had no cashback at all. And imagine, he expected me to go somewhere where I can change money and of course pay for the ride.\nThe lesson from the story: always have change with you or before taking the taxi, ask the driver if he has cashback if you have a bigger note.\nAs for taxis, there are also luxury taxis: the more beautiful cars are more expensive.\nMY TRAVEL COSTS IN DUBAI INCLUDING\u00a0 ABU DHABI IN TWO WEEKS\nThis will give you an idea of how much you will spend if you use public transport and taxis while vacationing in Dubai.\nDubai \u2013 Abu Dhabi: 2 return tickets, 100 AED (~27 USD)\nPublic transport in Dubai: ~ 70 AED (~19 USD)\nTaxi in Dubai and Abu Dhabi: ~ 120 AED (~33 USD)\nWater taxi in Dubai: 13 AED (~4 USD)\nPublic transport in Abu Dhabi: 20 AED (~5 USD)\nIn Total: 323 AED (~88 USD)\n10. IS DUBAI SAFE?\nIS IT SAFE TO TRAVEL TO DUBAI?\nI felt safe both as a human being and as a woman. In Dubai, there are a lot of rules and if people don\u2019t follow them, they are in trouble. Therefore, people are more disciplined.\nIS DUBAI SAFE FOR WOMEN?\nI consider Dubai safe for women including solo female travelers. I spent the entire two weeks there by myself.\nIS DUBAI SAFE FOR AMERICANS?\nAbsolutely, it is. It\u2019s out of the question.\n11. WHAT TO WEAR IN DUBAI?\nWhat to wear in Dubai is an interesting question. This question mainly concerns women.\nTo put things into perspective, remember that the United Arab Emirates is a Muslim country.\nInspite of the fact that tourists and residents are not required to dress modestly anymore because Dubai\u2019s main goal is to attract tourists and expats from all around the world, I know that local Emiratis do not feel comfortable with the way most foreign women are dressed up.\nAs I see it most foreign women completely disrespect the local culture with they are dressed up. However, I personally believe that respecting the local culture wherever we are as guests is extremely important.\nWhat Do Women Wear in Dubai\nIn Dubai, you will find women wearing all kinds of things. You will see women wearing Islamic dresses such as abayas and women wearing western clothing.\nWhat Women Should Wear in Dubai\nOn the one hand, I think it doesn\u2019t matter what you are wearing because nobody will say anything if you are not wearing modest clothing.\nOn the other hand, as I said it\u2019s crucial to respect the culture where you are a guest. I personally cannot ignore the fact that I\u2019m in a Muslim country where you are expected to dress modestly. I do respect that.\nLet me tell you how I dress up when I\u2019m in Dubai.\nThe only places where I was wearing short things are the Dubai Marina, JBR, and beaches. These are neighborhoods and places where most of the residents are western expats.\nHowever, everywhere else, I would only wear long pants or skirts and I would wear shirts that do not reveal too much cleavage and cover my shoulders.\nThat\u2019s only me. I\u2019m so used to traveling in Muslim countries and I cannot do it any other way. I would just feel that I\u2019m disrespecting the culture.\nActually, in Dubai, I prefer covering up also because inside malls, hotels, and the metro, they have air conditioning which is super cold compared to the temperature outside.\nFrequently Asked Questions Regarding What to Wear in Dubai\nDo you have to cover up in Dubai?\nNo, you don\u2019t have to cover up totally in Dubai unless you visit a mosque.\nCan you wear shorts in Dubai?\nOfficially, you are not supposed to. However, a lot of foreigners including Europeans, Americans, and Asians are actually wearing shorts in Dubai in every neighborhood. I personally would not do it.\nWearing a short in Dubai Marina, JBR and places for swimming, sunbathing, and partying is ok.\nCan you wear a bikini in Dubai?\nYes, on the beaches, in the beach clubs, aquaparks, and in the swimming area of hotels and resorts.\nWhat clothes should I wear in Dubai?\nFor hot days, you can buy light and airy cotton clothes that cover your body. There are really a lot of nice dresses for the warm months that are both comfortable and modest at the same time.\nWhat Not to Wear in Dubai?\nThese are the things that you should not wear in areas other than Dubai Marina, JBR, beach, and beaches for tourists and ex-pats.\nToo tight dresses\nTransparent clothes\nTops where your bra can be seen\nToo short skirts and shorts\nDresses and shirts showing too much cleavage\nClothes showing too much skin\nYou can; however, wear them in nightclubs, beach clubs and in most hotels and resorts.\nBut I as I said, there are a lot of people, both residents and tourists, who are ignoring these rules. I personally advise my readers to respect the local culture by keeping in mind the dress code in Dubai.\n12. ALCOHOL IN DUBAI\nDubai is home to nearly 9 million ex-pats and before the coronavirus pandemic, each year Dubai received around 16 million tourists. Thus, buying alcohol in Dubai and drinking alcohol in Dubai are possible in many places.\nThe Dubai drinking laws and rules are quite strict but as a tourist, you will hardly feel it.\nOfficially, drinking alcohol is only allowed for non-Muslims. But in reality, Muslims drink alcohol in Dubai as much as non-Muslims.\nWhere can you drink alcohol in Dubai\nIn hotels, restaurants, bars, and clubs, you can drink alcohol. I\u2019ve never seen anywhere that Muslims were asked about their religion when they ordered alcohol.\nDrinking in public and drunk driving\nDrinking in public places including beaches is illegal in Dubai.\nBuying alcohol at a store\nTo purchase alcohol at a store, you need to go to a licensed liquor store, acquire your alcohol license and you are ready to get your booze.\nAs a tourists, you can apply for an instant 30-day alcohol license with your passport and Dubai entry stamp. It\u2019s totally free.\nTo find liquor stores, just google dubai liquor stores.\nIf you don\u2019t want to deal with that, buy your booze at Duty-Free inside the airport when you arrive in Dubai. You can purchase up to 4 liters of booze or two cartons of beer.\nDrinking age in Dubai\nBy law, you must be at least 21 years old to drink alcohol in Dubai.\n13. DUBAI SIM CARD\nBuying a SIM card is important in Dubai. If you have a Dubai sim card, you can call a taxi, make reservations, and use google maps and taxi apps to get around Dubai.\n13.1. BUYING AN eSIM\nAn eSIM makes it much easier to switch mobile networks. Instead of searching for the sim card shop, hunting for a SIM \u2018ejector tool\u2019 to remove the old SIM from your phone, then inserting it into your phone, you can switch to a different network with a phone call or online.\nCheck out the rates of the\nUnited Arab Emirates eSIM provided by Airalo\n.\n8.50 USD:\n1 GB, 7 days\n22.50 USD:\n3 GB, 30 days\n35 USD:\n5 GB, 30 days\n13.2. PREPAID SIM CARD UNITED ARAB EMIRATES\nPREPAID SIM CARD DUBAI AIRPORT\nAs soon as you get to Dubai, buy a SIM card. In terms of prices, it doesn\u2019t matter where you buy your sim card at the airport or elsewhere. The prices are the same or almost the same everywhere.\nDUBAI SIM CARD OFFERS\nWhether you land at the Dubai International Airport or the Abu Dhabi International Airport, you will find three internet providers there: Etisalat, Du, and Virgin.\nThey all have very good coverage including 5G coverage.\nEtisalat\nhas the best coverage including the best 5G coverage and it\u2019s the most expensive.\nDu\nand\nVirgin\nare the best in terms of price.\nI tried both Etisalat and Du. I was totally satisfied with the speed and coverage of these providers in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\nDUBAI SIM CARD PRICES in 2023\nDU DUBAI \u2013 THE BEST SIM CARD IN DUBAI\nDU Dubai Sim Card Prices in 2023\nThey offer monthly plans for tourists:\n49 AED (~13 USD)\n, 28 days, 2 GB +\u00a030 mins call:\n99 AED (~27 USD)\n, 28 days, 6 GB + 30 mins call\n139 AED (~38 USD)\n, 28 days, 10 GB + 30 mins call\n189 AED (~52 USD)\n, 28 days, 20 GB + 30 mins call\n299 AED (~81 USD)\n, 10 days, unlimited data, unlimited calls\nETISALAT DUBAI \u2013 WITH THE BEST\u00a0 5G COVERAGE IN DUBAI\nEtisalat Dubai Sim Card Prices in 2023 \u2013 Prepaid packages\n49 AED (~13 USD)\n, 28 days, 2 GB local data + 30 minutes local calls\n79 AED (~22 USD)\n, 28 days, 4 GB local data + 30 minutes local calls\n125 AED (~35 USD)\n, 28 days, 8 GB local data + 120 minutes local calls\n200 AED (~54 USD)\n, 28 days, 22.5 GB local data + 525 minutes local calls\n319 AED (~87 USD)\n, 10 days, unlimited local data + 100 minutes local calls\nA free Dubai sim card is included in each plan from Etisalat.\nVIRGIN MOBILE\nh6>Virgin Mobile Dubai Sim Card Prices in 2023 \u2013 Prepaid packages\nI got this sim card once.

IS DUBAI EXPENSIVE\nGenerally, I don\u2019t find Dubai expensive. A vacation in\nItaly\n,\nGermany\nor Croatia would cost you way more than a vacation in Dubai.\nYes, you can find the most expensive and luxurious hotels in the world in Dubai but you can also find cheap accommodation such as hostels for 25 USD per night.\nYes, there are a lot of expensive restaurants in Dubai but most restaurants are affordable. Average, you pay around 10 USD for lunch or dinner in very nice places. Moreover, in Old Dubai, you can get very delicious Indian food for less than 3 USD.\nThe public transport and taxis are really cheap in Dubai.\nIn Dubai, you can spend a lot of money if you stay in expensive hotels and choose to participate in all the fun activities that I recommended in this travel guide. The limit is the sky. However, if you are a budget traveler, you can easily manage on 350 USD per week or even less.\nBelow, you can see some of the prices I collected on the way.\n15. DUBAI TRIP COSTS\nFOOD PRICES IN DUBAI SUPERMARKETS\nSupermarkets in Dubai are awesome. They offer a wide variety of goods from all around the world.

Thanks!\nWhile visiting Dubai last fall I took notes everyday which led to this post,\nDubai Travel Guide for First Time Visitors\n! I don\u2019t know about you but one of the most frustrating things to me when preparing for a trip is researching items all over the internet. I review so many articles to gather enough information to make sure I am prepared for that city or country.\nBecause let\u2019s face it, how many of us have time to read an entire Lonely Planet book? (Although I do still occasionally download them \ud83d\ude42 Therefore, I will continue to write travel guides for my readers. My first\npost about Dubai\nincluded my favorite pictures and was on overview of how I spent 5 days there. That post will help you build your Dubai itinerary. This post is a long list of Dubai travel tips that will cover almost everything else you need to know. So here is my Dubai Travel Guide!\nDo You Need a Visa to Go to Dubai?\nNo\u2014with a US passport, you do not need a visa to go to Dubai (or Abu Dhabi), which is a part of The United Arab Emirates.\nHow to Travel to Dubai\nWe took Emirates airlines directly from NYC to Dubai. They had a 2 for 1 deal airfare which was great! Emirates airlines has deals often and they fly from several cities across America so I do suggest signing up on their website. They also offer free layovers\u00a0in Dubai. We met several people who were taking advantage of traveling to other countries on Emirates but stopped in Dubai on the way.\nYou can also fly on Etihad Airways into Abu Dhabi and take a shuttle bus or taxi one hour to Dubai. Qatar Airways is another option. They make a stop in Doha before continuing on to Dubai. Of course you can use US based airlines as well.\nThe Best Times to Visit\nDubai is HOT! I know-Duh. During the \u201cwinter months\u201d, which correlate to ours, the temperatures are cooler with highs in the 80s to lows in the 60s. This is from November to March. Based on these temperatures, this is tourist season in Dubai, so expect it to be more crowded and prices to be a bit higher if you plan your Dubai trip for this time period. However, in the summer months from June to August, temperatures average a high of 105!\nThe Best Places to Stay\nThere is no shortage of hotels in Dubai, especially luxury hotels. You can also check rental sites such as Airbnb. In terms of the best location, you should first think of Dubai as a long strip. I compare it to Las Vegas or Cancun if you have been to either. We kept driving back and forth, up and down the same main road.\nThe most central location, and hence the most crowded, is around the Dubai mall which is where Burj Khalifa is located. At the other end is the Dubai Marina with Palm Jumeirah and Burj Al Arab close by. On the complete opposite end of this \u201cstrip\u201d is the Dubai airport and Old Dubai with the souks. Along most of this strip is Jumeirah Beach filled with beach resorts, shops and restaurants. Based on your interests, you may prefer to stay closer to one of these landmarks.\nGetting Around Dubai\nJust like any major city and tourist area, there is a lot of traffic in Dubai. There is also rush hour traffic. You should be aware that the work week in Dubai is Sunday through Thursday. Their weekend days are Friday and Saturday. This affects the time it takes by car/taxi getting from one location to the next. Traffic is much lighter on the weekends.\nTaxis\nFor the best prices use the regular taxi cabs and not the fancy Lexus taxis. Check to see if there is a meter in the taxi and you can also ask what the price will be from one location to the next. For example, we were unaware of an automatic surcharge leaving from the Metro station on Palm Jumeirah to the Dubai Mall.\nMetro\nDubai has a very clean and easy to use Metro system. During the week and rush hour this may be your best bet based on the traffic. However, the day we used it we found it be crowded (no seats available), we had to change trains and wait for long stretches since it was a weekend day and the distance to the metro in the Dubai mall was a long walk! It took us over an hour to get to our location using the Metro so give yourself plenty of time if you have to change trains. During the week the trains run more often.\nHop On/Hop Off Buses\nThis is another way to see Dubai and there are two systems available. Both are located at the Dubai mall for pickup and have different routes that take you to all the main areas. Unfortunately, due to Thursday rush hour traffic we were not able to see as much as we would like on our bus. Therefore, if you decide to do this, start early in the morning, do it on a weekend or purchase a multi-day pass.\nWhat to Wear in Dubai\nThis is a source of stress for many people traveling to the United Arab Emirates, especially those wondering about traveling to Dubai as a woman. I found\nthis article\nprior to our trip that was very helpful. Basically, tourists and ex-pats wear regular clothes. The only time I wore a traditional hijab and abaya was visiting the Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi. I expect that would be the same when\u00a0visiting any mosque.\nWhile on the beach I was actually surprised just how skimpy people were dressed or not dressed \ud83d\ude42\u00a0You are also expected to have on closed-toe shoes with pants or long skirts for ladies with your shoulders covered while dining in restaurants in Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab.\nPDA in public\nBefore arriving in Dubai my husband read that we could get arrested for\npublic displays of affection\nwhile in Dubai, so we refrained. I later read that holding hands and a peck on the cheek are fine.\nHow Much is a Trip to Dubai?\nMoney, Money, Money! Although I am sure there is a budget friendly way to do Dubai, I found it to be costly or at least comparable to the US. Their currency is called \u201cdirham\u201d or AED for Arab Emirate Dirham. You may see it abbreviated ads Dhs or DH. The dollar bill denominations conveniently have Arabic on one side and English on the other side. There are coins as well.\nThe current conversion is 1 Dirham equals 0.27 USD. But again, once I did the conversions for taxis, food, tours and our hotel, it was equivalent or more to what I would pay in the US. Keep in mind I am a luxury blogger so\u00a0my activities included\u00a0high tea at Burj Al Arab, a stay\u00a0at a luxury hotel on the Dubai Marina and I did some private tours.\nYou can exchange money on arrival at the airport but we noticed a slightly better exchange rate at the malls. And there are plenty of malls. In terms of American credit cards, most places only take Mastercard or Visa. Our hotel and the Nike store in the Dubai Mall accepted American Express but that was it-based on our experience.\nDo They Speak English in Dubai?\nWe found that most people were fluent in English and the street signs, menus, basically all the signage was in both Arabic and English. This made it very easy to navigate.\nCome with me on food & wine adventures around the world-\nCulinary Travels\n!\nFood & Alcohol\nThe food is fresh and it is delicious! Dubai is known for multicultural cuisine and pretty much anything you are\u00a0want to eat you will find here. I was excited to try authentic Middle Eastern dishes. There is a heavy Asian, including\u00a0Indian,\u00a0influence to the food in Dubai which I noticed while having brunch at Saffron at the Atlantis resort.\nSince this is a Muslim region, do not expect to find pork in the restaurants. However, there is plenty of seafood, lamb, beef and chicken. Popular dishes include shawarma (sliced meat like a kebab), hummus, curried dishes, basmati rice and marinated whole fish (I ate a whole sea bass vs a filet while in Dubai). Dates are also very popular. They come in many varieties and you will find date markets and fancy date shops in the malls. Try some with Arabic coffee.\nPlease, please\u00a0ignore all the American fast food places while in Dubai!\nAlcohol\n: Tourists are allowed to drink at licensed hotels, bars and restaurants in Dubai. Our hotel fridge was fully stocked! However, you are not allowed to drink in public, including on the beach. Public drunkenness is also not allowed (if only this was the case in the US \ud83d\ude42 In order to purchase alcohol in Dubai you would need a license. To get around this you may purchase alcohol at the duty free shop at the airport.\nThings NOT to do in Dubai\nFor more about the \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d things to do and see in Dubai, check out my post on how I spent my\nfive days there\n.\u00a0 But sometimes it\u2019s just as important to get travel tips on \u201cCAN miss\u201d tourist activities. Based on my experience, these are the attractions in Dubai that you don\u2019t really need to stress about fitting into your trip.\nThe Top of Burj Khalifa\nAlthough crowded, it was\u00a0well\u00a0run operation. However, I was not impressed with the views from the top. Granted, it was a bit hazy that day but most of what we saw were the skyscrapers close by and the desert. If you have been to top of other buildings such as the Empire State Building or the John Hancock Building, I think you will be disappointed.\nFriday Buffet Brunch at Saffron in the Atlantis Resort\nBrunch in Dubai is held on Fridays. I chose Saffron since it was described as a fun day party. It was really brunch on steroids. There was a DJ and more food and alcohol than you can consume in 3 or 4 hours. If you are going with a group, I think this will be fun. If you are looking for a more intimate or fine dining brunch experience, this is not it.\nAtlantis, The Palm\nSpeaking of Atlantis, if you have seen pictures of Palm Jumeirah you have noticed the Atlantis resort sitting at the end. Although I have visited Atlantis in the Bahamas, after gazing at this man-made island for years I knew I had to visit the island and the resort. We took the monorail to Atlantis in order to see the individual islands that make up the Palm. That part was pretty cool. However, Atlantis was an enormous hotel/resort with people everywhere. There were security guards making sure tourists did not enter areas for the guests and it took forever to find Saffron.\nBut, if you do love Vegas style hotels with the high ceilings, designer shops, multiple restaurants and large crowds then you will love Atlantis. If not, stay away from it! lol\nThe Dubai Fountains\nThe Dubai Fountains are located at the Dubai Mall. They were designed by the same architects of the fountains at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. We waited 30 minutes in a hot crowd to watch 3 minutes of the fountain show. It was quick and not as elaborate as I had imagined. I was disappointed. I have been told it depends on the length and type of the song. There are restaurants with outdoor patios located around the fountains so if you have time sit and watch more than one performance.\nA Day Trip to Abu Dhabi\nAbu Dhabi is located approximately 1 to 1 \u00bd hours driving distance from Dubai depending on the traffic, so it makes a good option if you\u2019re looking for places to go from Dubai. There are many popular attractions in Abu Dhabi including the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, Yas Island and Emirates Palace. If you choose to do a day trip to Abu Dhabi from Dubai you can take a daily public shuttle bus, hire a taxi, rent a car, or do a private tour. Since we wanted to see a lot in a short time, we decided on a private tour. Emirates Adventures picked us up from our hotel for a full day tour of Abu Dhabi. Again, depending on your budget, there are many options available.\nWhew, you made it to the end! I know this is a lot of information to take in but I hope this Dubai Travel Guide has been helpful, especially for first time visitors. Be sure to read \u201c\nHow I spent 5 Days in Dubai & Abu Dhabi\n\u201d\nfor more information. Overall I enjoyed our trip to Dubai. It was modern, clean, easy to get around, the history is interesting, the food was delicious, the Arabian sea was warm, and there were lots of activities to choose from. I wish we had more time in Old Dubai and I definitely enjoyed our afternoon and evening in Burj Al Arab, our day trip to Abu Dhabi and the desert safari.\nHave you been to Dubai?

Though it\u2019s not on my short list, Dubai is definitely one of my must-visit places. I find it interesting that their work week goes through Thursday.\nNadeen\nsays:\n8 years ago\nI am glad you enjoyed the post Terri! It is an interesting place to visit.\nYaa\nsays:\n8 years ago\nI really appreciate this article and it\u2019s so timely for me and my family who plan to visit at the end of the year. Thanks for the \u201cCan\u201d miss section. I hate spending time and money on overrated experiences.\nNadeen\nsays:\n8 years ago\nI totally agree!! If it is free and you have time then I suggest still doing as many activities as possible and drawing your own conclusions.\nJuanita\nsays:\n8 years ago\nI GREATLY appreciate you sharing the details of your trip as I\u2019ll be heading to Dubai and Capetown next week.  I never looped back around to tell you how much your Cuba made my trip that much smoother, so thanks again!\nI\u2019ve booked all of my tours for Dubai, except for my city tour.  I\u2019m also planning a private driver vs. group.  Do you know the difference in their 4\u00d74 vs. \u201csaloon\u201d chauffeur? Which one did you choose?  Thanks in advance!  I\u2019ll be heading to Asia this year as well so I really enjoyed following your Thailand trip on IG.\nNadeen\nsays:\n8 years ago\nThank you for letting me know how helpful my guides have been!  I am in South Africa for the second time now and I love it! For Dubai I booked the 4\u00d74 with a group for the desert safari. For my day trip to Abu Dhabi we had a private driver in a regular sedan. I\u2019m not sure what the saloon chauffeur is referring to but it sounds fancy. Lol. Have Fun!\nkhourshem\nsays:\n8 years ago\nMy experience in Dubai has never been a disappointment. The best way to see Dubai is by hiring a driver. You can negotiate a set price for a few days. You can rent a car in Dubai but traffic can be stressful especially if you don\u2019t know where you are going. We hired a driver. It allows you more time to see the city as well. The driver we hired we paid approximately 375.00 and then gave him a tip at the end for another 80,00.\nNadeen\nsays:\n8 years ago\nGreat advice thanks!\nIsabelle\nsays:\n8 years ago\nDubai is more glitter than gold. The taxi drivers are a nuisance and public transport such as their version of the metro is unaccessible to the public, you have take a car to use it. Meaning it is often near a busy road that does not allow pedestrians to cross.\nNadeen\nsays:\n8 years ago\nI did not have that experience. There was a train station right outside our hotel.\nLara Jack\nsays:\n8 years ago\nAmazing article!
